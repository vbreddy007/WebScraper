Hello Experts,
I have two Source Storage Types: LOW and HIGH
I have two Queue : MIXED and NORMAL
My requirement is when a picking WO is created (having multiple WTs) where source Storage types are a mix of LOW and HIGH , the Queue should be 'MIXED'. On the other hand, when a picking WO is created where source Storage type is only LOW, the Queue should be populated as NORMAL 
Is there any way to achieve this via configuration or BAdI with minimal bespoke coding?
P.S. - I am aware that BAdI '/SCWM/EX_WHO_CREATE' is used to create WO from scratch but then SAP will leave normal processing of WO creation.Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks
Hi,
that is difficult.
As the queue is determined by WT, you can not use information of the source storage type, as this would lead to different queues and different WOs.
Out of my head I do not know how to achieve this by customizing.

And if your question includes the word "transfer order" - do NOT tag the question with Extended Warehouse Management!
 Dominik Tylczynski - I have tried /SCWM/EX_RSRC_QU_DET - but the import parameter on this BADI only deals with one WT at a time. Therefore, no way to know if the other WTs on the Warehouse Order would have LOW or HIGH and thereby it can't be concluded about what Queue to plug in.

Hi!
Try to use ENH at the end of fm /SCWM/WHO_PARALLEL_CREATE to replace queue.

Hi Experts,
How to find out the SQL statements and APP usernames that are trying to consume more memory 800 GB from the database.
Is there a monitoring view and standard SQL statements..Please let me know.
Thanks in advance
Daniel basis
The best way to find out the SQL statements and application usernames consuming more memory from the database is to use the SAP HANA system views. The System views provide detailed information about memory and CPU usage, as well as information about the user sessions and SQL statements being executed. You can also use the SAP HANA Cockpit to get this information. The system views you can use to get the information are:•   M_SQL_STATEMENTS – Provides information about the SQL statements currently executing on the database, including the username and application name.•   M_SERVICE_MEMORY – Provides information about the memory usage of the database, including the application name, username, and memory consumed.•   M_USERS – Provides information about the currently active database users.•   M_HOST_RESOURCE_UTILIZATION – Provides information about the CPU and memory utilization of the database. You can also use the SAP HANA Cockpit to get this information. The Cockpit provides an overview of the database performance, including information about memory and CPU usage, user sessions, and SQL statements.
you can have a look to SYS.M_EXPENSIVE_STATEMENTS view

It is feasible since an address can be stored on a Profit Center.  You'll have to research the table connections.

Hello experts,
i´m trying to connect a SuccessFactors API through SAP BTP Destination REST API Integration on SAP Buils Apps, however, i need to filter the URL to access to specific information of one employee, for example, I´m using the following URL: https://apisalesdemo8.successfactors.com/odata/v2/PerPerson, but I want to use data dynamically, adding something like this: "/PerPerson('123456')" where 123456 is the person id of some employee. 
I configured the Rest API like this:

Then, in the list configuration, i can filter on Relative path and query as I explained before:

When i try to configure dynamically this section I don´t have another option, only static text and formula:

And, in the formula's options i can´t add any variable,

so, I need help to filter dynamically the information of that API,
Thanks.
First, why do you use "list" if you are trying to get a single object?
In any event, we had a similar situation in our TechEd demo. We used the SAP Build Process Automation API where we wanted to get status information for a specific process instance.
So we defined the generic API in the base, but we also defined a variable in the request schema for the instance ID.

In the "Create record" action, we defined a formula for the relative path:

The formula was:
So now, when I have a flow function "Create record". In the configuration, I set the data resource to the data resource I defined above:

And if I click on "Custom object" I get to set the binding for the customer resource schema variable.

Hana studio can read SAP table, like lines, but value field not. 
For example, when read table MARD, it can see all the lines but the quantity in unrestricted stock show 0, even value can be found in SE16N 
liuhua tangHana Studio does not have the ability to read the values within an SAP table. You will need to use a different tool or interface with the SAP system to access the values in the table.Hana Studio does not have the capability to read SAP tables and display their contents. The only way to view the contents of a SAP table is to use the SE16N or SAP GUI transaction.

for ex , i am trying to add Cndn type ZADC

after creation of the BAPI it appearing twice in the CONDITION RECORD tab.

 W_CONDITIONS_IN-ITM_NUMBER = LV_COUNT.
 W_CONDITIONS_IN-COND_ST_NO = '020'.
 W_CONDITIONS_IN-COND_TYPE = WA_SHEET3-KSCHL .
 W_CONDITIONS_IN-COND_VALUE = WA_SHEET3-KBETR.
 W_CONDITIONS_IN-CURRENCY = 'INR'.

Where can I download Crystal Report Developper 2011 or 2013 for Visual Basic?
I need a version that is compatible with the Crystal runtime provided by our ERP software (IFS) to do some report development.
Hi Louise,
You need to check with IFS support to see what version they support, you can't just update the runtime without checking with them first.If you do it could break their software.
To be clear it doesn't matter what version of CR runtime and CR SDK is, most applications will open any CR Report, we do recommend keeping the CR Report version up to date with the matching SDK but need details first.
So likely you need to use Crystal reports 2016 which you can get here:
https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/crystal-reports.html
Don't use CR 2020, it's a 64 bit version and needs a 64 bit DB Client to connect to your Database.
Don
Ah, let them know CR 2011 and 2013 is end of life and no longer available for download.
There is no specific CR for Visual Basic any more, that ended in Visual Studio 2008, it's now not included in Visual Studio but a separate download.
Here's the link to end of life.
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/SAP+Crystal+Products+-+End+of+Mainstream+Maintenance+Dates
CR 2016 will open their reports without problem and should work in their application without issues.
But if there are any they need to upgrade the runtime.
Also, both of those versions used Flash to handle Parameters, Flash is no longer supported and has been removed from your PC's so another reason they need to upgrade.
Good luck
Don
Hello all, I am using V 31 of CR for MS Visual Studio 2019. I have installed CR several times, with and without a runtime present, I can not locate the crw32.exe file in order to set the file association for the .rpt extension. I have several reports that run fine when created but an export of that report will not open after the fact. When trying to create the file association from C:\Program Files (x86)\SAP BusinessObjects\Crystal Reports for .NET Framework 4.0\Common\SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise XI 4.0\win32_x86, the only exes available are GenPSE.exe and sapgenpse.exe, neither opens the reports. Btw, all the reports are shown with the newer logo.
What am I missing?
Thank you, John
Hi John,
There is no crw32.exe included with CR for VS, the embedded designer is craxddrt.dll, which is CR Basic, it doesn't have the full features.
I suggest moving to SP 33 from here:
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/Crystal+Reports%2C+Developer+for+Visual+Studio+Downloads
Install the CR for VS for VS 2019 and below EXE, at the end it will ask if you want the 64 bit runtime.
Don't manually install the MSI packages, those are for redist only.
And you MUST right click on the EXE and select Run as Administrator to have special permissions, even if you are a local PC admin and User account.
You should then be able to Edit reports, if you want the full version of CR you can download CR 2016 - 32 bit or CR 2020 - 64 bit from here:
https://www.sapstore.com/solutions/99043/SAP-Crystal-Reports
It does require purchasing a keycode to install, this full version is not free.
Don
Thanks for your guidance, Don. 
My intention here is to be able to use the crw32.exe in order to set the file association for .rpt extension files. After downloading SP 33 I still don't find the crw file. My concern is to be able to both set the file association on my dev machine, as well on my end user's machines. What's my best approach to accomplish both of these concerns? Possibly for myself, it may be accomplished by installing the full version of the software, but my concern for the end users ability to set the file association on their machines remains an issue.
Once again thank you for your help and guidance, your straight-forward approach is refreshing and appreciated.
John
Hi John,
To be clear RPT file association is created in the Registry, so installing the MSI runtime packages, we don't support not using it for distribution, you can't just include the dll's in your app.
So if they don't have CR Designer installed or Visual Studio with the CR for VS installed there is nothing to open the reports with. You can't distribute craxddrt.dll that is used in VS to open RPT files.
So for your users or customers if you allow them to edit your reports they have to purchase a copy of CR Designer, only way they'll be able to edit report by double clicking on the RPT file.
If you have a Open Report button in your app then this may be what you are looking for:

Dears, 
kindly help in this issue: we have a route between RS1 and RS2, for some reason, the route's inbound queue is full (although transactions received to RS2 and applied to the replicated database), we want to drop the route and recreate a new one, so when we issue drop route command, the dropping message stuck and not arrived to RS2 because queue is full, so we issued:
drop route RS1 with nowait
then at RS2, we issued:
sysadmin purge_route_at_replicate , RS1
so, 
at both RS1 and RS2 rs_helproute return empty, 
and rs_subscriptions table at both rep servers are empty,
at RS1: admin who,rsi return empty result.
at RS1:
select * from rs_repdbs


HERE, should we delete it? 
ALSO,at RS1 the inbound queue which was for route still full of data, we issued:
sysadmin hibernate_on , RS1<br><br>sysadmin sqm_purge_queue,16777319, 0
but we got a message that we cannot purge this queue,
so we turn off the hibernate mode and issued:
admin disk_space

admin quiesce_check<br>
we noticed that partitions of that queue are still full and the following message was returned:
Can't Quiesce. Queue 16777319:0 has not been read out. Write=74011.47 At least one reader is missing<br>
how can we fix this issue (purge data from queue 16777319), to be able to re-create a new route between RS1 and RS2,

Hello, I am a junior supply chain data analyst with very few SAP skills (OJT only at this point) and no programming experience. Please talk to me like I'm a Cheeto.
I've used my SAP account as a maintenance electrician, for purchase requests, and now this, if that could help lead to an answer. Our SAP guru has made changes to my account with each of my two previous roles, but he is now unavailable for an extended period.
My colleague and I are using the same T-code, same variant, and have the same boxes filled out when prompted for information as we move toward execution. We have the same start and end dates set. She has run her extract alongside me to make sure we're doing everything the same. Yet her report from yesterday begins with data from 1/5/23 and mine begins with data from 1/18/23. She gets 4,871 rows in the extract, and I get 4,452. That difference is not accounted for by the 1/5 vs 1/18 start dates alone. I am also pulling some data that she is not, so it's not just that I'm missing things.
The only thing we have thought to try is making sure my time zone is the same as hers, which it is. If anyone can help with where we might want to compare our settings/etc., that would be immensely appreciated. I am able to compare my report from Friday to her report from Friday, but will not be able to compare our settings until Tuesday.
Thank you again for any help.
Hello https://people.sap.com/erin_m,
If the input criteria is same then it seems you are not authorised for some objects like company code/ plant/ sales area etc. Please check both data's and try to find out for which particular data in a column is not showing.
Also check in your output variant if there is any filter is assigned or not. If yes then remove it and compare your data.

Since SAP Conversational AI will soon be one of the cancelled solutions, we are looking for an alternative for our existing customers.
Does anyone have tips and suitable alternatives? Or maybe is also going down this road?
At the moment we are faced with a few options to evaluate:
- Hyperscaler options (Lex, Azure Bot Services...).
- Specialized service providers (Landbot etc.)
- Custom development (CAP backend, GPT3-AI, UI?)
For the Custom part the biggest question for our scenarios is in fact a smooth an proper UI which works well on all platforms and offers some kind of support, be it from a vendor or a large and up-to-date community

If you go to https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/Crystal+Reports%2C+Developer+for+Visual+Studio+Downloads, there is a link to "Crystal Reports for Visual Studio Licensing" in the "Related Content" section toward the bottom of the page. I believe this link gets updated if/when the licensing is, so it's the best place to go to make sure that you have the latest information.

Hi Phil, did you get an answer? i am struggling to find out if i need or my customers need licenses when deployed from CR for VS

Hello, all. I'm trying to build a simple VS2022 test application integrating the trial version of CR2020. There is effectively one line of code:
 Dim CrystalReportSource1 As New CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine.ReportDocument
Which is returning an error:
 BC30002 Type 'CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine.ReportDocument' is not defined.
I need to know what reference to add or Import in order to be able to use this ReportDocument object class (or an alternate object class name, if this has changed to something outside the CrystalDecisions namespace.) I've tried a number of Crystal Reports 14.0 references that looked promising but didn't help. And in previous (CR2008) versions of this same project I had successfully used the following Imports statements, but the targets are no longer found: Imports CrystalDecisions.Shared Imports CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine Imports CrystalDecisions.ReportSource Imports CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine.ReportDocumentThanks in advance!
Crystal Reports installer no longer includes the .NET runtime.
You need to get it from here:

Download the CR for VS 2022 or above EXE, it will prompt at the end to install the 32 bit runtime, click OK.
Note you must install using Run as Administrator by right clicking on the EXE.

With Crystal for VS, you need to reference the version 13.x.x.x assemblies in your application, not the version 14.x.x.x assemblies.

Hi Marc,
See my Blog for upgrading, it answers a lot of your questions:
https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/30/upgrading-a-visual-studio-2008-2019-.net-project-with-the-latest-cr-.net-sdk-packages/
As Dell noted, don't mix CR runtime. Version 13 is standalone and version 14 if connecting to BOE/CR Server. No longer can connect to those using CR 13 runtime, not needed if you don't.
Main thing to note is you must set all Copy Local to False, clean out your \bin folder of any CR dll's that may have been left over, mixing runtime will cause problems.
Also note with VS 2022 your app.config file should no longer be adding CR references and CR runtime is for you platform and not the OS.
Also, when adding the CR Viewer to your Windows Form be sure you are selecting the right version, I also recommend not browsing to the assemblies but using the Extensions tree in VS to select them
Don
Hi Marc,
You don't need to manually install the MSI packages on your DEV PC.
When you install CR for Visual Studio SP33 64b installer (VS 2022 and above) it will install the 64 bit MSI but not show it in Programs and Features. At the end of the install it will prompt if you want the 32 bit runtime, Click OK and install it.
You should only see this for CR for VS, CR Designer doesn't matter for this install:
SAP Crystal Reports Runtime Engine for .NET Framework (32-bit)SAP Crystal Reports, version for Microsoft Visual Studio (64-bit)
We don't support any higher framework than 4.8 is likely the cause, select 4.7 or 4.8 only.
Almost there...
Uninstall the 64 bit MSI and then repair the installer, because it's going to remove all of the runtime.
Thanks again
Don
Hi Mark,
I hate this format, to many threads to follow, I like what every other Forum does, just post in a sequential stream so it's easier to follow the thread and whats been done.
OK, first thing is I don't suggest using the WPF viewer, it hasn't been developed as much as the Windows Form, and getting things fixed is tougher, it's not as robust as the Windows Form.
Open Connection is database client not being in the correct format, 32 or 64 bit, or if it's based on a PC type it tougher to find a 64 bit Client.
Uninstalling the 64 bit runtime doesn't patter at this point, it's the same one the EXE installs.
Single step through your app when you get to the database logon info and mouse over each collection and see what's missing in the collections/property bags.

Dear experts,
When I write on MIRO the PO and press Enter, I expect the details of the PO to be derived to the invoice.
In works perfectly for single account assignment.
However when I use Multiple Account Assignment on order line, and put the order at MIRO, the icon of the account assignment (green/yellow arrow) is empty, meaning the amount and quantity have not been derived from the PO.
How may I amend it please?

Hi, 
I have a supplier that deliver pieces from Monday to Friday and can provide maximum 32 pcs per day and I have set: 
Lot size: FS
Fixed Lot Size: 32
Takt Time: 1 
Rounding Value: 32 
Planning Calendar: 900
Now when MRP runs it creates schedule lines on all days from Monday to Saturday, how is it possible to have delivery schedules only during week days? 
Thanks. 
Dear Federica Lucini Pajoni,
I guess you are having in your factory calendar Saturday marked as working day, right?
You can check via transaction SCAL under "factory calendar".
If Saturday is marked as delivery date because of factory calendar, then I think this issue will be hard to solve.
As lot-sizing "FS" is static procedure which can not be combined with periodic procedure like "PK", which is taking into account planning calendar. I might be wrong, but I'm not seeing easy solution here.
Please confirm if Saturday is working day in your plant to understand root-cause of it.

Hi All.
I want to use REST POST method in SAP BODS, i need detailed documentation on that, i was able to find the GET method, but with POST its different, also the POST service which i want to push data to, uses no parameters and have a JSON format as body only in request.
https://blogs.sap.com/2016/06/07/consuming-rest-web-service-in-sap-data-services-using-web-service-rest-datastore/
It is getting difficult to prepare a proper WADL accordingly. 
Any help is appreciated.

HOW TO REJECT BATCH SELECTION IN ISSUE FOR PRODUCTION ?
Hi Everyone,
We made a software (development) what uses SAP UI5 and written in SAP Fiori.
My question is that can we import and convert it to BTP or we must write the software again from zero in BTP?
The app itself mostly stays the same, however the way it is deployed changes as you will need to use an MTA. BAS (Business Application Studio) can take care of that though and generate an MTA by guiding you through a wizard. 
I think you can move one by one to BAS and deploy to BTP
I done customer master creation and given that the customer is sold-to-party in account group while creating . The customer is also a wholesaler. Now Where I have to mention that the customer belongs wholesale.
Then I have to reduce the price to all wholesale customers, in which transaction code it can be done.
Hello YUVARAJESH Reddy,
You can assign such type of value in customer group. This field you can see under tab Sales in Sales Area Data. If you need to maintain the price list of wholesale customer then this field should be in your access sequence for pricing. If you have not idea about it then connect to SD Consultant to define and assign this requirement. However price list can be maintained in transaction VK11 and change in VK12.
Some businesses using distribution channel to define wholesale and retail customer etc. If it's already defined in your system then you can maintain the price list on the basis of distribution channel if it's already placed in your access sequence.
Regards,
Neeraj Jain 
In customer master Sales tab, you have a field "Price Group" which you can make use of, to differentiate pricing
Hi Experts,

We create an inquiry, quotation and Indent sales order (Ex.SO no. 123) than we created a new DMR sales order with reference indent sales order(SO: 123) and created a Debit memo with reference DMR sales order. all the documents like DMR sales order, Inquiry, Quotation and debit memo status is completed but Indent sales order status is open. 

Please suggest me how indent sales order's status can be changed as complete automatically in above scenario.

Thanks in advance.
Shatrughan 
Hi shatrughan,

Check the copy controls between DMR sales order and indent sales order in T.code: VTAA. Check the field 'update document flow' is checked at item level or not. Also check the fields billing relevance and allowed schedule lines in the item category of indent sales order.

Regards,
S.Himavanth.
Hi Shatrughan ,

Is the material in the Sales order relevant for delivery ? if so, only when you create the delivery, the sales document gets completed. 
Hi,
The completion rule is managed by the item category you use in the transaction. Please check your item category in VOV7 and check for the completion rule. If you dont have any completion rule, update the  correct completion rule there and then try a new transaction. It will work now. 
Hi,

What is the value in the "Billing Relevance" in Item Category?
Hi Shatrughan ,

Check the Quantity of the line item in "Indent Sales Order" and the DMR. Is it same?
Shatrughan,



Could you please explain what is an "indent sales order"?
And why do you create it?
A DMR order could be created without reference to an order.

An explanation of the entire business process would be helpful.

Thank you, in advance!

Dear experts,
I created a MTA project with HTML5 module. I'm invoking workflow rest and odata api In the HTML5 modeule.
It was working fine if deploy this project to BTP.
But when I tried to directly preview this HTML5 application in BAS, it returns 404 NOT FOUND.

I tried to put VCAP_SERVICES that contains destination and worfklow into my run configuration's env property.

But it still cannot invode workflow related APIs. 
Am I missing a configuration? How can I make it works?
Thanks and regards,

show us your xs-app.json and your code to call odata

Hi Pamela,
maybe the error logs of the managed approuter tell you more about the 404 error:

Hi ,
I would like to see if other methods exist........
I am developing an approval flow using SAP Build Process Automation In it, I am using Mail Notication to notify the approver via email when the approver receives the approval request.
I would like to include a link in this email that will connect to "My In box" when clicked.
Unfortunately, however, this feature does not appear to be present.
The link could be implemented (by the mailer's functionality) by writing the My Inbox URL as text in the BODY as shown below.

Are there any other means other than the way I did it?
I would originally like to link directly to Approval Form instead of My Inbox.Regards,JT
Hello Jim,
Yes, Link cannot be added into email text but we have roadmap item (with no committed timeline) to include links in email as well as approve/reject directly from the email. You can use Cloud Integration or any CAP application to send email to designated user and then call the service from the process. 
Hope that helps,

Hi Team,
I have a requirement where I need to hide this new button for company code based on CR type. Basically, for this particular CR they should not be able to add a new company code through New Button, but they should be able to edit the existing one which is already present.

Please provide more details on the UI screen. 
How is the screen built? SAPGUI, Webdynpro based, Fiori UI5 based? 
Dear Experts, 
We are in the process of creating a BTP APP via RAP, which will have the following scenario. 
The initial screen of the app, will be looking as the attached screenshot. I am looking at a possibility of disabling of the selection of items based on the condition, e.g if the weight is 40, the selection of the product should be disabled. just and ex scenario.

Is there a way this can be achieved using the annotations or the virtual component concept?
Any inputs will be highly appreciated. Thankyou
Best Regards,
Sudha
Hello Sudha,
I assume you would want to click on some buttons to perform some action after selecting some item(s) in the list. Instead of disabling the items, you can always disable the action which you want to perform based on your condition using RAP Feature control. You can learn more about feature controls in RAP here

Hi Experts,,
Firstly, I am a beginner with SAP and Crystal Report. I need to create an invoice view report using Crystal Report.
My input is an invoice number, and I want to see the customized invoice layout on the output.
Kindly help me in making this report.
Hi,
There are couple of invoice related templates in the samples SAP Crystal Reports has and you can access those from the start page in Crystal Reports designer under link "Samples and Templates", but those look bit extensive.
But should give you an idea about the invoice reporting.
Alternatively, if you have the sample layout of the fields and data you want to display in the report, you can create query and try designing the report and can share here if you face any issue.
Thanks,
Raghavendra
We're planning to switch to the new Mac with M1, but we're wondering if we can continue developing/debugging/testing our Hybris project there.
Has anyone tried or know an issue running Hybris in Mac M1 or Big Sur.
The short answer is yes. Yes it'll run on an M1.The tanuki service wrapper doesn't yet support the M1 chip (though i think i saw support is coming in version 4.0), so if you've not yet had to install Rosetta to support another application, you may have to manually install to allow hybris to startup. After doing that I was able to startup just fine and haven't noticed any problems
 Darwin Ramos The only way I've found is that you have to also be running java through Rosetta 2 as well. If you've loaded an arm based version of java, you'll get the error because its looking for that version of the wrapper. But if you're running an x86 version of java through Rosetta, then it will load the proper wrapper and the server will start up without any issue. The one downside is that java through Rosetta is considerably slower than the universal version.
You can follow below link aswell.
https://devista.ro/blog/hybris-on-m1/
Hello Guys 
I was facing the same problem then finally I found the solution. I am using Macbook Air M1
if you are not able to start the server and if you are getting the Wrapper error when you start your server. 
Then you need to do below things.
1) run the below command using sudo access
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine wrapper-macosx-universal-64
Hi Everyone,
I just started using m1 pro mac and i am not able get a successful ant all, it throws 840 error in the compile step of platformservices. I thought that it was caused by my jdk choice but i tried oracle jdk, openjdk, azul jdk, adoptopenjdk but all failed. Do you have any idea why this happens ?

Posting only possible in periods 2012/11 and 2012/10 in company code 0001
Message no. M7053
Diagnosis
The posting date entered is not within one of the permitted posting periods (current period/previous period).
This can be due to one of two reasons:

The correct current period has not been set in the system.


  For the system, the first of the entered periods is the current period. At the beginning of a new period, your systems administrator must change the current period in the material master record, using the function "Shift periods". This has not yet been done. 


You have entered a wrong date in the field "Posting date".

Procedure
Check the posting date and correct it if necessary. If your input is correct, inform your systems administrator that the "period shifting" (period-end closing) process has not yet been completed. 
Hello https://people.sap.com/lokeshv777
First please check transaction MMRV for your company code what current period is showing open. If it's 11/2012 then you need to open current period by transaction MMPV. 
To open the period please connect with your MM/FI Consultant as they need to open the period almost for 10 years. If you have an idea to open then open the period carefully one by one month.

Have you tried breaking it down to only do one of the validations at a time?  Also, I never validate cardinality because it takes too much time and sometimes it's wrong.

I've seen ODBC connections be problematic and have this appearance. Try using an OLEDB connection, even if you just use it to run the Integrity Check.

Hi,
SAP just released a patch 2105.8 to fix this issue.

Posting only possible in periods 2012/11 and 2012/10 in company code 0001
Message no. M7053
Diagnosis
The posting date entered is not within one of the permitted posting periods (current period/previous period).
This can be due to one of two reasons:

The correct current period has not been set in the system.


  For the system, the first of the entered periods is the current period. At the beginning of a new period, your systems administrator must change the current period in the material master record, using the function "Shift periods". This has not yet been done. 


You have entered a wrong date in the field "Posting date".

Procedure
Check the posting date and correct it if necessary. If your input is correct, inform your systems administrator that the "period shifting" (period-end closing) process has not yet been completed. 
Hello https://people.sap.com/lokeshv777
First please check transaction MMRV for your company code what current period is showing open. If it's 11/2012 then you need to open current period by transaction MMPV. 
To open the period please connect with your MM/FI Consultant as they need to open the period almost for 10 years. If you have an idea to open then open the period carefully one by one month.

Hi All, 
I am using Universe (.unv) and when I run Integrity check, its hanging or showing not responding.
I already cleared universe cache like LSI file but still its showing not responding.
Kindly advise.
Thanks
Have you tried breaking it down to only do one of the validations at a time?  Also, I never validate cardinality because it takes too much time and sometimes it's wrong.
-Dell
I've seen ODBC connections be problematic and have this appearance. Try using an OLEDB connection, even if you just use it to run the Integrity Check.
Trying to pass parameters like below leads to build error 
"crossNavigation": { "inbounds": {}, "outbounds": 
{ "OverviewPage": { "semanticObject": "alptechapp", "action": "alptechapp",

hi Sireesha Varada,
Your manifest is not as per the expected format for the outbound parameters.
Update it as below and your error should be resolved.
Also please check your semantic object and action becuause it might lead to other errors as both have been mentioned as same for the "OverviewPage: property and I believe it would have been a typo.
Thanks,
Vaibhav
Hi Sireesha
Please check the definition of the manifest:

Also, there seems to be a missing { before "ActualCostsKPIDetails":

After enabling the SAP BTP Trial version and Integration Suite, I encountered an issue when attempting to access the SAP Integration Suite application, as I was presented with an unauthorized page. Despite attempting to assign roles, I was only able to see one role (IntegrationProvisioningAdmin). If anyone has experienced the same issue, I would greatly appreciate any advice or potential solutions to resolve this problem.
Hi Mohan Kalla,
You have to open a new Browser session after you have already been denied access for lack of authorizations. Even after you add the authorizations required, you cannot access it within the same context of the browser session you've opened. 
Best way to test it is to either by closing all browser instance and trying to access it again, or by opening a new Incognito Session - which will allow you to log in again.
Keep in mind that after you have already logged on, your SAML token will be kept on that browser session for other applications. The attributes (including roles assigned) will only be refreshed on the token when you perform a logon. So, unless you do that, you will end up with the same token - which is not updated when you add roles to your user.
Hope this helps.
Best regards,Ivan
Hi guys,
We have ABAP products Netweaver 7.50 and LT replication 2.0 (source system). We want to perform homegenous system copy to downgrade a system which currently is Netweaver 7.52 and LT replication 3.0 (target system).
Basically, we want to mirror our N+1 system (latest components version) from BAU system (old components). 
Is this possible via homogenous system copy?
Hi Philip
To my understanding SAP system copy (Homogenous system copy) means, that the version in the source system will be the same as the target system, you can't downgrade, and also will to the mirror options are the same,

Dear Experts
Could you please let us know why the tax percentage decimal places is showing only two decimals in the receipt print even though we have configured the decimal places as three in the configuration.
Is there any way to change the decimal places in the receipt print if yes how to do this?

Dear Anderson
The receipt is from SAP CCO print templates (Standard one)
Thanks
Hari
Dear Anderson,
We have not done any customization in the receipt print. it is a standard one which is provided by SAP
Hi Hariharan G ,
did you follow my posted link from above (KBA 2717189)? I think this should work.
Actually I do not have any experience with CCO, but this KBA and the linked PDF there look promising - just give it a try :-)

Andreas
Dear Anderson,
Can we know how to do this in the receipt template?
Thanks Mr. Andreas for the KBA
Thanks
Hari
Hello  Hariharan G,
The US localization is supported in CCO Feature Pack 14 onwards. The reason why you don't get printout as you would expect it is that your CCO is running on a version lower than FP14.
I checked in CCO FP15 PL00. The CCO standard receipt print template displays the full tax percentage out of the box, in this example 8.875%. No modifications / customizations done to the standard print template.

Kind regards,
Gunther

Hi,
I have added some unwanted Jobs to the central repository which came along with the project. Is there a way to delete those jobs permanently from central repo?
Can we check out the project from central repo and delete the job in the local library and then checking in that project again to central library will delete that job in central repo/central object library?
Hi Swapna,
You first need to delete the job from the central repo by bringing up the Central Object Library window, selecting the job in question and then right clicking on it. Select the Delete option and it will be deleted. Once that is done, then check out your project from the central repo, delete the local copy of the job and check the project back in.

Thanks, Dave
Sometimes there will be job failures that impact the day-to-day operation and business.
common errors such as "Time series update failed with an exception for a specific version ."
the possible root cause could be :

 Data Quality Issues: Inconsistent or incorrect data can cause the time series update to fail. This can be due to errors in the data, missing values, or invalid data types.
 Configuration Issues: The time series update can also fail if there are issues with the configuration of the system, such as incorrect settings or missing master data.
 System Performance Issues: The time series update can also fail if the system is underperforming due to resource constraints, such as memory, CPU, or network bandwidth.

let's talk about the time series table reach to the limitation in some cases.
When a time series table reaches its limitations, it means that the maximum capacity of the table has been reached, and the system can no longer store additional data. This can result in errors and issues when trying to update the time series data and can impact the overall performance and accuracy of the IBP system. And the Data Volume/Data Retention and system performance may contribute to the time series table reaching its limits.
to resovle this issue what we need to do is:
1. Housekeeping: 
Garbage collection can be used to resolve a time series table reaching its limitations in SAP Integrated Business Planning (IBP). Garbage collection is a process that frees up memory that is no longer being used by the system, and can help to reduce the size of the time series table and prevent it from reaching its limitations. and the good news is IBP 2302 there will be an improvement regarding Garbage Collection. The HANA parameter enable_ce_execution_without_snapshot, which will be active by default in IBP 2302. By enabling the execution of calculations without snapshots, the system can process and analyze data more quickly, and provide more up-to-date results. When the config is on, it can reduce the span of GC block. GC is blocked while a long running snapshot is live. Before the configuration was introduced, the procedure execution holds a snapshot during the whole execution. Logger procedure runs, longer blocking GC. By the configuration, a procedure execution doesn’t hold the snapshot longer. Instead, it delegates the snapshot taking to the sub-operators, where they are likely to run during shorter time.

2. Prevent & Protect
To keep a close eye on the system status, EWA  can be a good option and if you want to do more proactive monitoring then the Time Series Statistics card in System Monitoring app in your IBP system should be a good option.

Hi，

Try this:

SELECT T0.ItemCode, T0.ItemName, T1.ItmsGrpNam, '1' AS 'Property'
FROM dbo.OITM T0 INNER JOIN dbo.OITB T1 ON T0.ItmsGrpCod =T1.ItmsGrpCod where T0.QryGroup1 = 'Y'
UNION
SELECT T0.ItemCode, T0.ItemName, T1.ItmsGrpNam, '2' AS 'Property'
FROM dbo.OITM T0 INNER JOIN dbo.OITB T1 ON T0.ItmsGrpCod =T1.ItmsGrpCod where T0.QryGroup2 = 'Y'
ORDER BY T0.ItemCode

When you found it working, you need to copy the same logic to include the other properties.

Thanks,
Gordon

Hi Experts
we want to reschedule all our production receipts with below requirements
- production orders operations (which are back dated) - should reschedule and start on today's date
- future firm planned or production orders (which are not aligned) should be realigned to Sales order requirement date
for above, we tried using "rescheduling" function in CDPSB0 but keep getting error as "No slot available for Activity G". Based on SAP help document,, GR processing activity G should not generate capacity requirement on Handling resource. 
 scheduling-error-in-cdpsb0.png
But why we are seeing this error is not known. 
below are set up and observations
- Handling resource is infinite and utilization is 400% ( which is max possible)
- Resource utilization in CDPS_REPT and its showing more than 10000 % load on handling resource.
handlingresource-utilz.jpg
- SO requirement date is Oct 25 and my production order is able to reschedule on Sep 06 as opening date ( I see resource utilization is dropped to less than 10000% in that week.
so-dates-alignment.jpg
- Scheduling Strategy is "infinite scheduling" with planning direction as Backward+reverse
this is really a basic expectation from PPDS to reschedule our receipts but somehow we are not able to get to that..
can you please let us know if we are missing on anything or what are the corrections if any needs to be done to get rid of that error or do we need to follow any scheduling heuristic 
your help is really appreciated

Hi,
What is your operation 0160, and on which resource it is being made could you please provide information on that operation. Also is that resource which is on operation 0160 finitely scheduled ? If yes it should be infinitely scheduled so that you dont get this error. You can also try and check if the strategy insert operation helps.

Greetings.
I'm working on a relatively simple SAP Fiori Elements app (List Report - Object Page).
I must add a functionality to the List Report page, which disables the GO button, until a filter value is selected in the filter bar (for simplicity we can assume that there is only one filter).
How can I implement this functionality in SAP Fiori Element? Is it necessary to use SFE Extensions or Customization?
Thanks in advance for any help or feedback.
Hello Isaac,
I'm a member of the SAP Fiori Elements v4 development team and after checking our documentation, it's still the case that the "Go" button is always visible and can't be switched off just via configuration.
For your reference you can check https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/4bd7590569c74c61a0124c6e370030f6 and go to the section Additional Features in SAP Fiori Elements for OData V4 where you can find this information.
If your concern is about initial loading of data you may find additional help here https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/9f4e1192f1384b85bc160288e17f69c4.html
However I will take your question with me and forward this to our product owners so that they may consider it as a possible future requirement, since there was a similar demand already in the past.
Greetings,
Please find the following source code to disable GO button first.
Simultenously, after inserting filter values, you can enable it again.
Hello Isaac,in CDS you can use the following annotation to make a filter field mandatory:
I will follow up internally to see, if we need to adapt some documentation.
Hi All, There was a UX decision in the past that the disablement of the go button will not be supported in V4.

dicen que las vistas de las bd mejoran el rendimiento de la misma. Entonces para ejecutar algunos reportes y consultas ocupo unas de ellas, pero ocupo saber tambien si puedo jalarlas desde el query manager. Podría ser esto posible??.osea, si al generar la vista puedo utilizarla en el query manager o la puedo extraer con el xlreporter. esa es mi pregunta o en su defecto podría ser mejor utilizar crystal report?.Agradecería mucho me pudieran contestar.Edited by: mary merecias on Jul 10, 2009 11:43 AM
Hola Mary.

Si, se pueden llamar o invocar desde QM.

Se invocan así:


Así como se invocaría en Query Manager, también funciona en Crystal Reports. En cuanto a XL, dudo que sea posible.

Espero sirva de ayuda.

Hi Everyone,
Is there a way i can copy or modify the query of a report that was generated by the system such as Sales analyses or Sales report (Open item list) ? There's times that i do want to add more fields to that report and would be much easier if i could simple copy the query and add the fields i need such as salesperson's field etc or directly modify the query and save as new report? I use SAP Business one and have B1 up addon.
Need urgent help please.
You cannot modify system queries, system reports use multiple queries, views and stored procedures. Best way is to write you own query its always flexible to modify a query written by you rather than understanding someone else's query. 
Can i get to know the normal time it takes for getting new SAP Business One New User License in Existing Production System requested via a partner.
In normal circumstances It should not be more than 1 week. It depends upon your SAP B1 partner and region as well. Best way is to discuss it with your partner contact SAP local product expert in your region

In outgoing payment screen, There is reference field in which we have inputted the character length up to 20. After that we have checked the journal entry of that outgoing payment and found 8 character value only into Ref 2 field. (Header level field) 
How this can be reduced by the system and it's fixed 8 character only as well as the field is also disable by the SAP. What is limit length of that field (Reference 2 Header level) into journal entry while its fetch the data from the payment screen ?
Is there any restriction into REF 2 field length when the Ref2 data is come via outgoing payment through?

Dear Experts,
We have a client who started down the road with Branches and we are still in the Implementation phase. They want to disable Branches now.
So we do have the following:

Test DB with Branches turned ON
Prod DB with Branches turned ON

In the Prod DB (that is empty of Master Data) we cannot turn Branches OFF.
What would be the most efficient way to copy all the Setup and Config, CoA to a new DB where Branches is turned OFF?
I was thinking doing the following:

Create new empty DB 
Use Quick Copy to import the CoA (Hopefully this will not import the branch settings too.
Use Quick Copy to import other data: Master Data, Setup, Users, Authorizations, Layouts and Reports.

Your advise will be very helpful.
Marli Schutte
Hi,
Quick Copy will copy all data included Branch information, then you cannot use it for database without branch.
I suggest you can extract Master Data and use Data Transfer Workbench (DTW) for importing.
Hope this helps,
Son Tran 
Whatever tool you will use there will be limitations, my suggestion is export data in DTW templates and re-import it. Quick copy is the good option but there are some other tools like copy express or packager available in the market.

Even if you find the standard queries you cannot change them, they will not effect the display of standard reports. My suggestion is you should write a new query according to your requirements and it will be flexible to edit as well.

Dear Team,
we will use a sap table on the new form, kindly check the attachment Please suggest.


Good Evening Datta,
Yes, it's Possible. You can use Activity Object in User Defined Form - Matrix.
Best Regards,
Mahendrakumar D.P.
Hi It looks you want to add activity field in a customised form because 'Recruitment Tracker Candidates' is not a standard form. If this form is developed by add on then your developer needs to add new field. If its developed in SAP B1 as UDO then you can add new field from the user defiend fields setup and update the object in object registration form. 
Hello experts,
we want to enhance the sub-screen if you use in an SNP planning book the "Display Details" function (for PREQs or Planned Orders etc. which opens another screen on the bottom of SDP94 where you can see details of PREQs/PlannedOrders etc.) We found a BADI for the ProductView (//RRP3--> /SAPAPO/RRP_IO_COL to add custom elements) but nothing for this specific subscreen in SDP94. Any hints / recommendations ?
Regards
Thomas

Dear Thomas,
there is BAdI /SAPAPO/MSDP_SNPDETAIL_INT (enhancement spot: /SAPAPO/MSDP_INT) method GRID_DATA_SET to manipulate on the ALV grid in the detailed view, but it is classified as SAP-internal only. Only SAP CDP should be allowed to use this BAdI - and as far as I can see this BAdI method is never called in standard coding.
Alternatively please try if an enhancement point at the end of function /SAPAPO/MSDP_SNPDETAIL_GET could help to achieve your requirement. You could manipulate on et_order_detail. You are not allowed to change the definition of this table but might use unused fields like "characteristic" or "penalty cost group" to add your specific information.

Buen día estimados.
Quiero solicitar de su ayuda, les comento que cree un SP en Hana Studio, con 3 parametros:
CREATE  PROCEDURE TMK_PRUEBA (IN F_Inicial timestamp, IN F_Final timestamp, IN U_Trad VARCHAR(30))
Al ejecutarlo desde Hana todo funciona perfecto, luego realice una prueba en el Query Manager con datos quemados y también funciona correctamente:
CALL TMK_PRUEBA ('20191001','20191001','TMK001')
El problema que tengo, es cuando cambio para que el SP se ejecute con datos que el usuario ingrese:
CALL TMK_PRUEBA (
(SELECT TOP 1 T0."RateDate" FROM ORTT T0 WHERE T0."RateDate" = [%0]),
(SELECT TOP 1 T0."RateDate" FROM ORTT T0 WHERE T0."RateDate" = [%1]),
(SELECT TOP 1 T0."U_TRADE" FROM OCRD T0 WHERE T0."U_TRADE" = [%2])
);


Cabe mencionar que este error se genera cuando agrego el tercer parámetro (U_TRADE), pues si lo ejecuto solo con las dos fechas o únicamente con el tercer parámetro funciona. Los tipos de datos son los mismos.
Les agradezco si alguien pueden brindarme alguna ayuda para solucionar este inconveniente. Muchas gracias.
Hola estimado, quisiera saber si pudiste solucionarlo, yo tengo el mismo problema con SP en HANA que funciona muy bien desde HANA Studio, sin embargo, cuando le envío los parámetros desde el Query Manager me sale el mismo error. En mi caso el SP recibe 2 parámetros y ambos son de tipo fecha.
Hi,
I'm using batch determination in EWM embedded with S4 1809. I'm using characteristics LOBM_RLZ_PROZ to calculate the BBD. After create the outbound delivery I can see the batch determination is working fine. All values are correct and the batch proposed is also correct (Batch is not assigned in the ERP delivery). After delivery goes to EWM I can see the batch selection criteria is with the correct value in characteristics LOBM_VFDAT (same as ERP) and here starts the problem. First, the value LOBM_RLZ_PROZ is empty in EWM and the picking warehouse task is choosing a batch using FEFO. As a result, I should pick a batch with LOBM_VFDAT > 08.05.2022 and the WT has a batch with a LOBM_VFDAT = 01.07.2021
Thanks for the help!
Hi Lucas,
1) LOBM_RLZ_PROZ means remaining shelf life expiry date (SLED) as percentage and its task is to update search-expiry date in the batch search criteria. Let's say you have three batches of same product with different expiry dates.
Shelf life of your product= 100 days
Batch1 SLED= 05.03.2021
Batch2 SLED= 25.03.2021
Batch3 SLED= 26.03.2021
Delivery date=01.03.2021
If your criteria for batch search is LOBM_RLZ_PROZ>10% (It means remaining SLED after delivery date should be >10 days)
Then search-expiry date= 01.03.2021+10 days=11.03.2021
You will see search-expiry date (11.03.2021) in EWM as batch selection criteria.
So, Batch2 or Batch3 can be selected as 25.03.2021>11.03.2021 and 26.03.2021>11.03.2021
2) Batch sort sequence in ERP is not transferred to EWM as it has its own sequence from the storage type search/storage bin search. 
If you want to select specifically Batch2 or if you want to select the batch with nearest SLED among the batches comply batch-selection criteria (these are Batch2 and Batch3 in our case) in EWM, you need the define "Stock Removal Rule" according to SLED and use it in Storage Type Search Sequence.

I am using BODS with a HANA HDB data store. For UTC to Local , or local to UTC datetime value conversion, shall I use a generic BODS function, or call a function from the HDB? ALSO I needed to make sure that the DST periods are set correctly, which I hope the function called handles correctly itself? 
Thanks!
Greetings LeeFung Wu,
To convert UTC to local time you can either use SAP Data Services utc_to_local() function which you can easily insert in the column mapping.
To use the HANA UTCTOLOCAL() function you would need to use SQL transform or sql() function. This is because unlike SAP Data Services utc_to_local(), HANA's UTCTOLOCAL() function will not work on column mapping.

Best Regards,
Joseph
I am having some challenge calling the HDB function UTCTOLOCAL from within BODS... BODS simply can't find the function in the datastore.... any tutorial I can go through?

Dear Basis Expert,
I am working on an proposal SAP S/4HANA Technical Conversion from ECC6.0 EHP7 HANA 2.0 to SAP RISE PCE. The source DC is on premise and Target is SAP RISE PCE (Azure, AWS or any other hyperscaler). Please let me know the approach here for an Technical Conversion.
Also want to know what would be the difference between Private Cloud and Public cloud in SAP RISE from the SAP S/4HANA Technical Conversion From ECC6.0 EHP7 from conversion and migration point of view.
Appreciate your input.
Thank you
Regards,
Anil 
Hi Anil,
If you are going to S/4 HANA Cloud offers with SAP ECS in any hyperscalers from your source ECC ,normally it called S/4 HANA cloud private edition.
Another words, this offering from RISE or ECS team is to provide you a managed service to have your S/4 HANA in a segregated network with a dedicated subscription and a single tenant its infrastructure provided by a public cloud provider .
To make it simple, it is similar to S/4 HANA on premises but running in a hyperscaler and managed by the SAP team .
S4/ HANA Cloud, public edition is completely different because it is running in cloud in SAP PaaS (BTP) and is a multi tenants solutions. You as a customer only have access in a limited customizations and is not similar to on premises version served by a hyperscaler.
SAP will fully managed this public cloud offering as multi tenants and it is normally suit for customer starting their ERP practice not a customer with a historical ECC/ERP over years of customizations.
The high level approach which will be done by SAP and Partners:
System Requirements: Ensure that the source system meets the minimum system requirements for the target SAP S/4HANA version, and that the source system is on a supported release of SAP ECC6.0 EHP7.
There are three approaches: Greenfield, Brownfield , and Selective
Plan the Conversion: Plan the conversion process by identifying the conversion scope, mapping the business processes to the new SAP S/4HANA system, and identifying the necessary system downtime required for the conversion.
Prepare the System: Prepare the source system for the conversion process by performing a system analysis to identify system-specific customizations and modifications that need to be migrated to the new system.
Perform the Conversion: Perform the actual technical conversion using the appropriate tools, such as the Software Update Manager (SUM) tool. The conversion process involves upgrading the database schema, adjusting custom code and modifications, and migrating data from the source system to the new system.
Post-Conversion Activities: Perform post-conversion activities such as system testing, user training, and go-live preparations.
Hope this helps, 
Amin
Thank you Amin
For RISE with SAP - Public edition and Private edition would the SAP S/4 Hana Technical Conversion be done by Service Integrator (SI) or SAP 
All Technical administration task post conversion who handles them and what level of administrative access would the SI have ?
Can you please throw an insights on this.
Regards,
Anil
Hi Anil,
Doesn't matter you are a customer or SI you will not have direct access to OS level or Client 000 or there are other limitations too since this is a managed service offering .
You need to review R&R document to get all details:
ECS Roles & Responsibilities
During migration to S/4 HANA from on premises to cloud ,some certified partners can have access to support the migration activities but still after go live the system will be managed by SAP ECS team.
In the customer technical discussion the SI supporting customer (if there is any) and SAP team including sale, SAP architect and Project lead will be the whom can start the conversation.
Please reach out to your SAP regional sale for further follow up and details.
Thanks,
Thank you Amin, Appreciate your help.

Hello,
I wish to have fully understanding of the need of ERP HCM after Migrating to SF.
what Happens to SAP ERP HCM after Moving/Migrating All Modules to a full cloud Successfactors?
Do I need to keep Partial functions in HCM, if SF become the main source of data and processes, do I really need HCM for any integrations?!, and I'm not talking about Cost center integrations here, only HCM.
Thanks
yes if you can require data in ERP, it ll remain there and then you build integration from EC for the latest data to be updated. you can scope what infotype data is needed from SF EC into ERP and accordingly build integration 
above links provide sample templates as well
If you dont run Payroll or benefits or Time in HCM and all functionality is mapped to SF from HCM.
 then HCM can be retired. please check currently what is being used in HCm 
you would need to integrate with ERP ie HCM only, as data is updated in standard replication to HCM
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_SUCCESSFACTORS_EMPLOYEE_CENTRAL_INTEGRATION_TO_SAP_BUSINESS_SUITE/a7f164924edd4dfe817b7bdc2fc4927a/6356389965e14fca8df1fc92536acb87.html?locale=en-US&state=PRODUCTION&version=2211
this is one option 
depending upon scope ie less data if you need you can use MDI

Hello everyone!

Does anyone know how can I have the 'Functional Area' field in the 'Additional Data' tab being completed automatically in a PM order by SAP? 

The profit center is already being completed from the cost center of the Main work center, but I also need to have the Functional Area being completed automatically. Right now, we are populating this field manually.

Thanks for your help!

Kind regards,
I think this will be derived based on order type using. Check transaction KOT2.

Also check the SAP help link.

http://help.sap.com/saphelp_ish471/helpdata/EN/cb/259048e2f011d496eb0000e835339d/content.htm

FICO consultant is best person to conclude this query.
Hi Ximena,

This field should be automatically populated from the master data of the cost center of your Main Work Center.

Kindly check the master data of the cost center used in the Main Work Center if the field for Functional Area is maintained. If not ask your Master Data administrator for Cost Centers to update the record with Functional Area.

Best regards,

Hello Experts, 
I'm new to the Asset Manager. I think whatever the configuration we have in S4 wrt PM functional perspective, is simply transferred to the Asset Manager when we hit the Sync button in AM. 
Now the requirement is, the WO and notifications are to be listed out in AM on priority basis (Emergency one at the top of the list in AM)
Now, what happening is the WO without any priority assignment are listed out at the top of the list with status "Started" and then the Emergency, high, medium and low priorities follows. 
To avoid this, if I make Priority field mandatory at OIAN will solve the issue, and I believe nothing to do with the AM configuration. 
Please confirm me I'm in the right direction.
Thank you,
SAP Service and Asset Manager does sort by priority primarily in the list view screens, it also has a section on the overview page for High priority WO only. 
SAP Service and Asset Manager, is also designed to only have 1 started WO on the device at any point in time. 
The priority field is mandatory when creating / updating WO in the application. 
As you mention this would be solved by filling in the backend priority. Otherwise you could filter out WO without a status. 
Hi there,
We are not having success viewing DMS documents from within Screen Personas. This is specifically for Maintenance Notifications (IW23) but I've also tested this using the view DMS document (CV04N). This does not work using the default (unmodified) flavor. It does work if I use the standard web gui. I've tried different document types, but this is typically either PDF or pictures of type jpg or png. I get the standard E: E::000 error.

Thanks!
Patrick
This appears to be a known issue in Slipstream, for which there is a note in the works by the Document Management team: 
3287670 - Viewing document in Personas Slipstream engine via CV02N/CV03N/CV04N fails
However, it is still in Pilot status. Once it gets released to customers, it should resolve the problem. If you want to be added to the pilot customer list to test how the solution works for you, create a support incident directed to component CA-DMS and they will be able to help you further with this.
Hi Patrick,
We faced this issue and logged it with SAP DMS Helpdesk and nothing came out of it. We faced this problem after upgrading in SP14, in lower SP version there was no issue for opening DMS in Slipstream because we were using it in lower SP version and then with SP14 implementation we got this error that you're highlighting. The worse part of it was that we could still save the DMS but we couldn't retrieve (i.e. display it).
We ended up creating an implicit enhancement to FM CV120_DOC_CHECKOUT_VIEW to display the DMS document using html viewer instead of CL_GUI_FRONTEND_SERVICES=>SHOW_DOCUMENT, the HTML viewer is used for non kpro documents.
That's right Tamas, we went to SP14 as well upgraded to support pack 18 where there was changes to FM CV120_DOC_CHECKOUT_VIEW which caused this issue. We logged this issue under ticket 454579/2022 and SAP logged into our system observed the issue and went nowhere. We had this functionality already up and running in our Production system so we had to do the fix ourselves. Our temporary fix is working so we just wait when this note becomes available and stable. 
Hi there,
we are running SAP S/4HANA 2020 and using both SAP GUI transactions and Fiori Apps are used by different types of end users.
We now plan to enhance the user experience by Computer-Telephony-Integration (CTI). Especially by opening certain user interfaces on incoming calls.
1) we will not implement any full-size call center solutions like CRM-IC or SAP Contact Center
2) as far as I know for SAP GUI transactions the SAPPhone protocol together with a suitable telephony system can be used
QUESTION:
3) What is the go-to-solution for CTI with S/4HANA Fiori Apps? Let's say for example "go to app '360° Customer View'" on incoming call?

Hi experts,
i have two system . PAA and PWA

when i transfer IDoc from PAA to PWA . in PWA system i am getting the Error in inbound Idoc as "Check tax classification; maintenance is incomplete". help me to solve this error.
Thanksℜgards

This looks like an error on application level, not a technical ALE error. Therefore, you need to check the IDoc type, find out to which application this IDoc belongs, and then ask people with know-how for this particular application (e.g. tax processing).
From ALE & Connectivity point of view, no one will be able to help here.

Hi,
following scenario: GR based invoice verification is used. Invoice verification is done after GR has been posted.
These steps happened:

12/2022: Invoice created with 100 EUR
01/2023: SA price was updated to 120 EUR
02/2023: GR posted with 120 EUR 

The invoice is now tracked as a price difference. How can Scheduling Agreement and Goods receipt consider the invoice date (12/2022) for price determination?
Thanks.
Maurizio
Dear Supply Chain Analyst,
There are not many options for sched. agr. with time dependent time conditions as there is hardcoded price determination control ->  
5 - GR/Post. Date (the price determination date is the posting date of the goods receipt)

You can ask your abbaper to take look on this issue and maybe he/she will be able to come with custom logic based on IR date.
You are using GR based invoice verification but how invoice posted before GR document posting?
12/2022: Invoice created with 100 EUR and 02/2023: GR posted with 120 EUR
But logically and technically when GR/IR clearing account playing great role here and as difference between GR & IR triggering PRD key with price difference account

Material A1000 Plant US10 Batch ABC1002 - Stock Qty 0

Batch selection shows the the list of batches ABC1000, ABC1001, ABC1002 where user is annoyed to see zero stock batch.
Any control not to show the zero stock batch for selection ?
Thanks.

Hello R G
F4 is a search help. It helps to select objects, here batches. Batches with zero stock do exist, hence they are displayed. You should use batch determination strategy instead of F4 search help to pick batches during GI posting.
See SAP Help: Batch Determination in Inventory Management
Best regards
Dominik Tylczynski
You should refer project document and find how these information  triggering in MIGO screen itself for goods issue- these information should be helpful for user before entering material number with batch and if zero stock user should not select that material to post!
when we create a new customer project and when we pick to public project setting is no, or the other way if it is yes everyone can see my project so, in both options, people that I haven't added to my project they can see my projects, In this case, how can I prevent people that I have not added to my project from seeing my projects? thanks in advance
Hi Elif,
to solve the issue please take a look at the restrictions within your used roles and catalogues. There is a field available for restrictions of confidential projects. The following values are available:
In your case the value probably is currently "*", by changing it to "N" the projects should be only visible by namely stated people.

Hi,
here is the scenario.
I am using ui5 table in view, by using OData method I am fetching the data from ABAP and by using JSON model the data is binded to table in controller. while testing with huge number of records the processing of controller is completed but view is not loading properly.
sometimes the data is loading and sometimes it is not. I can see some kind of performance issue.
so, we are considering of doing pagination to minimize the excess time. With this above design what would be the right approach.
or is there any performance analyzing tool available.
can you suggest me any another way.
You should not load the full set into your app, instead use paging. Using the OData model has this out of the box.
what's the volume of your data? how many column you have for the table?
Hi Kadari, 
For Grid Table, simply add these properties 
This will load the first 110 entries and more on scrolling, handled directly by OData rather than JSONModel.

Hello everyone,
I found in my system, that standard table MKAL (Production Versions), in transaction SE11, has the flag "Data Browser/Table View Editing" set to "Display/Maintenance Allowed":

That's very dangerous! 
All IT guys could modify production versions, in an uncontrolled way, by direct modification in the database, and cause inconsistencies...
Does anyone now why SAP did this? And how can it be fixed?
I had the doubt that someone (an IT colleague) in the past could have modified this setting in my system, but I didn't find CRs in CR versioning:

Can anyone help me?

Both are similar in the information they convey (i.e. part to whole analysis). Both of them become difficult to interpret if you have more than 3-4 categories. Better Alternative would be Bar charts (vertical/horizontal).

Recommendation to use IW37N/IW49N and IP30H rather than their predecessors also exists in ECC since quite some years.
When Creating and Running the "Generate data for access request SoD", we are always only retrieving one user. The user is the first id in the list for a risk. We configured the Agent Type to Directly Mapped Users, we have run all batch jobs in order. We are executing this in our Sandbox enviroment but have run the SOD report and know full set of users. Would much appreciate any suggestions anyone has.
Hi Mike.
I know you mentioned that you have run the required jobs, but just to double check, you need to run the repository sync, role usage sync, action usage sync and the batch risk analysis (with offline analysis, par 1027, enabled).
You also need to have parameters 2016 to 2023 configured.
Your risks must have owners set (if par 2018 is set to Risk Owner) or your users must have managers assigned in GRACUSER (if par 2018 is set to Manager), and concerned rolles must have been imported to BRM.
It is also a good idea to have the Admin Review step enabled so you can check if any of your reviewers (risk owners or managers) are missing coordinators.
Finally, please confirm if the risks you are expecting to be shown are not already mitigated.

Hi Experts,
We are trying to replicate/simulate the solution order subscription line from S/4HANA Cloud system(5IK) to Subscription Billing however getting error "Contract accounts are marked as required in the subscription profile 'XX'. Provide a contract account for each item. Dont provide any payment details." As we are using scope item 5IK, the contract account is marked as mandatory in the subscription profile and accordingly the contract account is also maintained for the Business partner for which we are creating solution order. Looks like the maintained contract account from Business partner is not getting picked during the replication.
Can you please help here to resolve the error incase you have faced similar issue.
Thanks
Jyoti
Dear Jyoti,
unfortunately Solution Order currently does not support the handling of Contract Accounts and therefore cannot be used in case SAP Subscription Billing should be integrated with FICA (Scope Item 5IK).
This would be seen as a feature request within the S/4HANA Cloud Product.
For more information on missing functionality and feature requests please see 
2963059 - How to Submit Feature Requests for SAP S/4HANA Cloud Product
The correct Session would be "SAP S/4HANA Cloud for Sales, public edition"

Hi,
Is there any way to add system Information in the Fiori launchpad, we are not using any customizing setup( Not using any Web Ide/BAS) for the standard apps currently. So from Front end Gateway shall we maintain system information. Our customers are expecting at least a text to identify the S4T system for the new Users. Lets say " This system is the Fiori Test System"
Example: 

Thanks & Regards,
Madhulatha
Hi @Madhulatha,

Keep it simple:
- Define a Fiori theme for the launchpad of the test system to apply to all the user (in the User Action Menu à Menu à Appearance).
- Personalize the Home Page with the first group of the main apps entitled «My Test System».
 
This is just a suggestion without any customizing setup.

Kind regards,
Marlene
Hi Marlene,
Implemented as per your suggestions used CSS in Theme desiging. Thank you so much.

Dear guru's

i created the Acitivity type in kl01 and i want to assign the activity type to workcentre in cr01 at that time i am getting the error as No activity types assigned to cost center xxx, controlling area xxx on dd.mm.yyyy.
could you please help me in this regard.

Thank you
suribabu
To assign Activity types in work center, KP26 Activity Procing should be maintained. You check with your CO people. 

In KP26, give Version as 0, from period as 01, to period as 12 & year as 2011. Then input the activity type created & cost center which is going to assigned to work center.

Press F5. In next screen, maintain fixed & variable price.

Better you check with CO people for this.

Hi friends,
I have a requirement to select all the events, events name,begin plan ,End plan and all the data from DATES tab of delivery header for each delivery number and display in ALV output .Can you please tell me how to do that?
Thanks
Deepak

Hi!
Those dates are stored in TSEGE table, accessed with LIKP-HANDLE (ref this old thread ) and you can use the TSEG* FMs to manage them.
Hi all,
Can you advise how to configure that Delivery Header Date Tab?

Hi,
I'm a developer from ERP4SME team and we're working on a new product(B1aaS) which needs integration with IAG. 
I've being doing some research recently but I'm still not sure whether it could meet our requirements.
May I get a contact person from IAG development team to have a short call?
Thanks in advance
Cham
Hi Cham.
I'm assuming that by integration I'm assuming that you want IAG to be able to manage access in your application.
IAG is supposed to integrate easily with applications that expose a SCIM API. So the first step would be to make sure that your API follows this pattern (https://www.simplecloud.info/).
Regarding IAG configuration to connect with it, you have more details here:
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CLOUD_IDENTITY_ACCESS_GOVERNANCE/e12d8683adfa4471ac4edd40809b9038/5552327c065a49dbbf1988e112f65633.html?locale=en-US&state=PRODUCTION&state=undefined&q=SCIM&advAll=undefined&advAny=undefined&advPhr=undefined&advNot=undefined
But, in a short summary, if would be a matter of:
1) Creating the connection in BTP;
2) Configuring the proxy service in IPS;
3) Configuring the connector in IAG.

Category is asigned to this CMSNavigation component. 
Attach category to CMSLinkComponent for this CMSNavigationNode and create cronjob which periodically set visibility to false to node, it category has no products. 
So I solved this in a following way:
1) I've created a custom CMS Restriction which extends AbstractRestriction or you can go with CMSUserGroupRestriction, if you want also to apply it for some specific UserGroup
2)I am applying this restriction on the CMSLinkComponent (it can be done also from the smart edit in the Navigation Management)
In my hierarchy each category has a separate CMSLinkComponent
3) Added RestrictionEvaluator for my custom restriction , In the restriction evaluator I am restricting CMSLinkComponent's of the categories which have no products inside 
(this can be also combined with SearchRestriction on products, if you want to exclude some products and therefore the categories)
4) So after the changes above the response structure will be the following:
So what we did with our custom restriction is that we excluded CMSLinkComponent for ChildCategory2NavNode, thats why it has an empty list of entries [ ]
But the node will be still visible just without the link.
In order to hide the node:
6) There is a OOTB CMSNavigationNodeRenderingVisibilityRule , we gonna extend it and override (using spring alias)
also we gonna need to override isVisible(final CMSNavigationNodeModel itemModel) method
I implemented it like this, but you can refactor it as you wish, the idea is that we are hiding all the nodes , which doesnt have a children or entries(or all the entries that they are not visible) , or simply are not visible
After this being done the Child Category 2 Nav Node will be excluded from our response
I would like to abort a job from the command line by sending a command to the Data Services Management Console to simulate a user clicking the Abort button for a job. I know that I can find the PID and kill the associated al_engine job but I currently don't have access to the job server so I'm looking for an alternate way to programmatically kill a batch job that doesn't involve executing a command on the job server.
If there is a way to do this, please let me know, thanks!
Dave Christy
Hi David,
You can use web services with Stop_Batch_Job operation, I think this should help. Please check the data integrator guide.
Thanks
Nawfal
Greetings David A Christy,
The Simplest and quick solution to abort the job using the process id is to use the exec() function to send a kill signal This does not require one to have access to the Job server. For example:
If your Job server is on windows you can kill the process as shown below.
If your job server is on Linux you can kill the process as shown below

Hi,

Try this

SELECTION-SCREEN PUSHBUTTON /10(10) FIELD1 USER-COMMAND UCOM1.
SELECTION-SCREEN PUSHBUTTON 25(20) FIELD2 USER-COMMAND UCOM2.

Now both the buttons will appear on same line.

Place the code related to pushbuttons between 

Begin of line. and
End of line.
Hi,
I didn't get exact requirement, but i am giving this based on the reply you have given.
I think, you want to display the pushbuttons in two lines(not in same line) by using "BEGIN OF LINE - END OF LINE".

But it is not possible to display any thing(2 radiiobuttons/pushbuttons) in new line by using "BEGIN OF LINE - END OF LINE".
If you want, don't use begin of line - end of line.

Reward,if useful.
Thanks,

Please try my code:

 SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF LINE.
 SELECTION-SCREEN PUSHBUTTON /35(18) pb_cc USER-COMMAND push_cc
 MODIF ID mc1.
 SELECTION-SCREEN PUSHBUTTON /35(18) pb_co USER-COMMAND push_co
 MODIF ID mc2.
 SELECTION-SCREEN SKIP 1.
 SELECTION-SCREEN PUSHBUTTON /70(18) pb_up1 USER-COMMAND push_up
 MODIF ID mu1.

 MODIF ID md1.
 SELECTION-SCREEN PUSHBUTTON /35(18) pb_do USER-COMMAND push_do
 MODIF ID md2.
 SELECTION-SCREEN END OF LINE.
Sorry, this is the code i mean...

 SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF LINE.
 SELECTION-SCREEN PUSHBUTTON /35(18) pb_cc USER-COMMAND push_cc
 MODIF ID mc1.
 SELECTION-SCREEN PUSHBUTTON /35(18) pb_co USER-COMMAND push_co
 MODIF ID mc2.
 SELECTION-SCREEN SKIP 1.
 SELECTION-SCREEN PUSHBUTTON /70(18) pb_up1 USER-COMMAND push_up
 MODIF ID mu1.
 SELECTION-SCREEN SKIP 1.
 SELECTION-SCREEN PUSHBUTTON /100(18) pb_dc USER-COMMAND push_dc
 MODIF ID md1.
 SELECTION-SCREEN PUSHBUTTON /100(18) pb_do USER-COMMAND push_do
 MODIF ID md2.
 SELECTION-SCREEN END OF LINE.
If you noticed in my codes, the first 2 buttons have the same position because the first closes a screen block and the second opens it. The third pushbutton should look like to be the second button in the line. Again, the fourth and the fifth should look as only 1 button.
Hi,

Got an error while delivering sales order as-
Item 000020 - Delivery split because of conflicting header data (TRAGR 0001<->0002).
How this error can be removed?
What is the reason for such error.
Pls. guide.

Points will be certainly rewarded .

Regards
Dear Mrunal

Go to Material Master, select Sales: General/Plant view and compare for both the materials what is maintained in "Trans.Grp".  It should be different.  Maintain unique value and then retry.  Your problem will be solved.

thanks
G. Lakshmipathi
Hi Mrunal,

Delivery split can occur for the following reasons.

1. Different delivery dates for line items.
2. Different ship to parties for line items.
3. Different routes for line items.

Check whether the above data are same for all the line items..

Regards,

Raghav
Dear Mrunal,

 The fallowing data may cause to split as two deliveries

 -->Check the shipping points of the two items it may be different.

-->Check the item level partner functions in the Sales order is there different ship to parties available for the two items.

-->Check the Delivering plant of the items.

-->Check the shipping conditions are different for the two items.

-->Check the loading group of the two items.

I hope it will help you

Hi All,
I am having 2 fields on my RF screen. Material and HU. WH user can scan anyone field and move no next screen as per auto-enter functionality in the scan gun. However, when material ( position 1 on screen ) is scanned, auto enter causes cursor to move to field HU ( position 2 on screen ) .
 My requirement is to move to next screen directly instead of cursor moving on next field of same screen . I see that PAI FM is not triggered on hitting enter so I am clueless on how to overcome this stdnard behaviour. 
Please suggest. 
Thanks !!
For your logical transaction->Step, please check if Skip Shortcut is checked or not. under the below screenshot. I believe this might be the reason.

Dear All,
We want to use XI adapter for calling ABAP-XI based proxies that were developed using ESR. But since moving to CPI if we get any change like extending the proxy structure with more fields then what is the best approach for server and client proxies? Do we need to migrate it to MDR and then extend using ABAP wizards for adding new fields? Please elaborate in more detail.
If you continue to have PO systems, I would still use that system to update porxies and have WSDLs exchanged for CPI. Otherwise, yes, you may have to migrate to MDR.
Hi Abraham,
in the migration guide, we have described how to migrate from ESR to the backend metadata repository however it comes with the restriction that it supports global data types only, I take it that in most cases customers have defined free-style data types, so you would need to change your data types in the ESR to global data type before migrating to the backend metadata repository, so this is seen as workaround only, long term we plan to support the outside-in approach with proxy generation in Cloud Integration as well, as long as it's not available I'm afraid you need to go for the workaround
https://help.sap.com/docs/help/90c8ad90cb684ee5979856093efe7462/0797dc0e8ee64589803fd2194e59eb64.html
If you just like to migrate your proxy scenarios from PI/PO to Cloud Integration, so in case that you do not need to re-generate your existing proxies, we plan to enhance the migration guide describing how to run the existing proxy scenarios via Cloud Integration, e.g., what to configure due to lack of SLD, etc., this is already supported today but so far only described in a blog, so stay tuned

Hi, 
We created substitution, documemt header text will be updated based on document type.
Nothing is wrong with substitution, but the value is updating only after simulation in production system. Wheres in Qa server doc header text is updating immediately after pressing enter.
Need to make the substitution update immediately on the first screen without any simulation action.
Are the call points different in QA and Prod? You should use call point 1, Document Header. If It does not work again, you can try BTE's (in T-code: FIBF) for this purpose. 
Hi all,
Recently I have received a requeriment of user to divide ArchiveLink Documents in folder. Normal customizing creates an only folder (same name as the Business Object) and it is possible to create different document classes by OAC2 and OAC3.

Thanks in advance,
Hi Eduardo,
Did you find any solution?
I have the same requirement.
Hi Experts, I have the following line in the Invoice program executed in VF03 in quality environment and production environment the line is stopped there in both environments so should be executed, I verify the values for each variable (kbetr, kwert and fkimg) and in quality the line is executed right and the variable komvd-kbetr is getting the expected value but in production the variable komvd-kbetr wasn't change after that math operation was executed it looks like the line wasn't executed even when the break-point stopped in this line so should be executed, in Production the variable komvd-kbetr still having the same value before the break-point pass trough this line.
I already verified:
* All the variables (kbetr, kwert and fkimg) have the same data type between Quality and production.
* Both code is active.
* Same user between Quality and Production has the same decimal notation (SU01).

Why I'm saying that the line is not executed even if the break-point stopped in this line in production? Because komvd-kbetr has the value 26.00 before the line is executed and after the line is executed should be 26,000.00 (I did it in a calculator with all the values like quality is showing too) but after the line is executed still having 26.00 so it looks that the line was not executed.
Do you know why this is happening?
Maybe a dynamic logpoint can help you analyse the code in the productive environment:
https://blogs.sap.com/2020/04/21/adt-abap-debugger-what-to-do-if-your-program-does-not-stop-at-breakpoints/
The SD module is known to have programs which use the old flag "fixed point arithmetic" in programs, when it's not selected, the decimal point of the variables is ignored:

Documentation:
If you create a program, the option "fixed point arithmetic" is selected by default.
The below program has "fixed point arithmetic" not selected, and does what you experience:
Note that vbdpr-fkimg = '1.000' and vbdpr-fkimg = '1000' are equivalent when the option "fixed point arithmetic" is not selected.
Hi,

I´m currently building a Desktop Application with SAPUI5 and am trying to get a Table row draggable, e.g. sortable. I was looking at this code http://jsbin.com/iciyof/2/edit and tried to adapt it to the Table rows from just one table- later I want to drag a Row from one Table to another. So there are a few problems. The table´s size is bound to a model which is filled at sometime, when a textfield value is changed. After that, I try to run through the table via getRows and set them sortable. 

$.sap.require('sap.ui.thirdparty.jqueryui.jquery-ui-sortable');
...
...
...
textfield.change(){
 sap.ui.getCore().byId("positable").bindRows("/LieferkopfSatz('"+this.getLiveValue()+"')/Lieferpositionen");
 sap.ui.getCore().byId("positable").setVisibleRowCount(sap.ui.getCore().byId("positable")._getRowCount());
 for( var i = 0; i <sap.ui.getCore().byId("positable")._getRowCount();++i) {
 $(jQuery.sap.byId("positable-rows-row"+i)).sortable();
 };
};
So i read, that Controls can only be made draggable or sortable in the onAfterRendering() function. Is this right? Because that would explain, why nothing happens, when I try to make the rows sortable or draggable on their creation via textfieldChange(). 
Hi Hendrik,

The jQuery external library seems to load in indeterminate time frame that's the reason your code doesn't seem to work. You could load the jQuery UI library locally to get in working once the dom is loaded.

Just try this solution where i have setTimeout to execute the sortable method... but still this isn't the appropriate solution



Regards,
Ajain
 Hi again,

so I got it sortable right now, but actually sortable isn´t quite what i was looking for. I just need to drag a Table row to another Table. Then i want to know which row was dragged to insert that row into the second Table. With the sortable interface the dragged row is deleted from the Table it was dragged out of, but I need the row to be copied to the second Table. So I think, the draggable Interface is more what I´m looking for but I´ve got some trouble getting it working. But there´s another Problem, I got with the sortable interface, too. The Problem is, that I only get the cells sortable or the whole table. When i try it with this code 

$(document).ready(function() {
 setTimeout( function() {
 $(jQuery.sap.byId("positable-rows-row0")).sortable({
 connectWith : ".ui-sortable"
 }).disableSelection();
 },1000); 
});

all the cells are sortable.I also tried it by ("positable")).sortable or ("positable-rows")).sortable and ("positable-table")).sortable but these don´t do the trick either, they just make the whole table sortable, so that i can put a whole table into another. So I read in the Documentation of the sortable Interface, that to get table rows sortable, I´ll have to set the <tbody> sortable. I´m quite new to all of this so have no idea on how to code this. I found the <tbody> part in chrome and I don´t really know what to do now. 



Non the less, there is another Problem with the draggable Interface. I tried 

$(document).ready(function() {
 setTimeout( function() {
 $(jQuery.sap.byId("positable-rows-row0")).draggable({
 connectWith : ".ui-draggable"
 }).disableSelection();
 },1000); 
});

and nothing happens. I tried it with an image and it worked just fine.

So maybe someone got an idea on this?

Regards,
Hendrik

hi,
why can't i use these sap.ui.getCore().setModel(oModel) and this.getView().setModel("oModel","someModel") in functions other than life cycle hooks of controller in sapui5.
I am trying to bind model to the controls of my view without giving it an id. so i want to make a model and set that model to the view where i will bind.

Is there any way to access controls in controller of my view without giving it an id?Regards, Ajaay
why can't i use these sap.ui.getCore().setModel(oModel) and this.getView().setModel("oModel","someModel") in functions other than life cycle hooks of controller in sapui5.

1. You can access UI5 core using sap.ui.getCore() anywhere from your app as the core is a global object. So, sap.ui.getCore().setModel(oModel) also will work from any part of your code provided the oModel is available in the scope.

2. this.getView() - The reason for this which you feel is available only in the life cycle hooks (onInit,onAfterRendering ...) is this (keyword). You know what, this in the life cycle hooks refers to the controller. In the other functions, this might point to a different value. Say, you have a button and in the press event you wanna set a model. So if you do something like this,

/* view code */

var oButton = new sap.m.Button({press : oController.handlePress});

/* controller */

handlePress : function(oEvent){

 console.log(this.getView()); // Error. As this here refers to the control Button & not the controller.

}

You can have a look at this to know, how to make this refer to the controller in the handlePress func()

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21528745/correct-event-binding-in-javascript-view-different-this-binding-with-xml-views
 

Yes. Let me give you a sample implementation.

/*view code */

createContent : function(){

 this.oButton = new sap.m.Button(); // this --> view

}

/* controller */

onInit : function(){

console.log( this.getView().oButton ); // this --> controller. Retrieves the instance of button

}

hi, 
btp enable autocomplete powershell not working fine, 
I created Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 under C:\Users\myuserName\Documents\WindowsPowerShell
when I use btp enable autocomplete powershell on my windows 11 latest version, I insert Y, then 1 to choose the ps1 file, then autocomplete done.
when I want to use it, I opened command prompt, then type btp, then space, then press tab button, it does not give any autocomplete list or commands related to SAP btp, it give me completely different and wrong suggetsion list for another products
Hi Mohammad AbdAllah,
Maybe the following documentation helps:
https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/enable-command-autocompletion
After you install it, you have to close the shell, open a new shell and issue the ps1 script that was downloaded.
Once you run that script, you will be able to use autocomplete on Powershell.
Please keep in mind that autocompletion support depends on the OS shell you are using. Luckily, SAP does support it on Windows Powershell - but it is not the case for CMD. 
Best regards,Ivan
hi, 
thanks for sharing this file, but I already installed auto complete successfully, my issue with command prompt, once i login to command prompt, auto complete don't work.
Solution:
when i go to windows button, then use terminal, then open it, then btp auto complete is working fine.
best regards
AbdAllah

Maybe somthing went wrong with the download.

How did you download the file? FTP, Browser, etc. bin/ascii?
Did you retry to download?
Hello All,
Recently I went through the similar issue.
Resolution steps: - 
1.1st check the version of the SAPCAR if it is older version then download latest one and uncar the files.
2.There is chance to corrupt the existed SAR file so in this case download the effected SAR file and uncar the same and try.
Note:- In my case 2nd option is worked.

Hi,
Can you pls tell me how a third party abap programmer log on to his clients development server or abap workbench in HANA? Thanks in advance.
HANA is a database software, so there's no ABAP Workbench.
ABAP Workbench is part of ABAP-based software, including R/3, ECC, S/4HANA (means S/4 on HANA database).
To connect to ABAP Workbench, you must install SAP GUI (whatever it's "for Windows", "for Java" or "for HTML"), configure the connection data to the ABAP-based system, log in with the credentials given by the company, and run transaction code SE80.
Of course, a modern ABAP developer uses Eclipse with the ADT plugin.
Hello,
We are using the following npm package to deployed SAM2110 app with nativescript 8.2.2 to BTP Mobile services:

And is deployed successfully, however when you test it the app, is working in and Android but is not working in IOS, appearing the following message:

I've checked that tsconfig.json is properly and is included in bundle.js
module.exports = JSON.parse('{"compilerOptions":{"target":"es2015","module":"esnext","moduleResolution":"node","lib":["es2018","dom"],"experimentalDecorators":true,"emitDecoratorMetadata":true,"removeComments":true,"inlineSourceMap":true,"noEmitOnError":false,"noEmitHelpers":true,"baseUrl":".","plugins":[{"transform":"@nativescript/webpack/dist/transformers/NativeClass","type":"raw"}]},"exclude":["node_modules"]}');
Maybe the differecen between ts-patch version 1.3.2 in mdk tool and in my mdk is 2.0.1.
Thanks
That error typically indicates that the extension controls are not compatable with the MDK version being used.
What MDK version is your client?  Do you have metadata extension controls in your application?
Hello!
Our client would like to have an automated process for the new joiners to have their login method to be updated from PWD to SSO. 

Currently, they are handling it manually, updating the changes in "Manage Login Accounts" and initial upload of data is done through Basic Import of data. 

Is there any provision to handle this query by setting up a job that would update the login method status for the new joiners?!

Hello Experts,
I have a Semifinished material which is maintained subcontracting with Procurement type F & 30 Special Proc. Key.
And there are some Raw materials added under the semifinished material BOM. But when i run MRP for the SF material than in MD04 proposal shows only for the Semifinished material but no any requirements and proposals shown for the Raw materials. 
Actually i wants to create purchase requests for the raw materials also through MRP for subcontracting components. Is it possible ?

Hello
I see one subcontracting requirement of 1,000, which is most likely coming from the only PO that you have for your subcontracted material, so it seems that either the BOM was not exploded for requisitions and planned orders, or subcontracting requirements were not generated.
Are your BOM and production version valid in 2023? Was the BOM correctly exploded for all the planned orders?There is a field in tab MRP4 to control whether dependent requirements are relevant to MRP. Can you check the value of this field?

Hi Friends,I have Question , 1) I had created a report and set batch job for that , batch-job run daily at 08:40 am. When i execute the report, in the output it should show that which batch-job had run i.e Foreground/Background.I had written a logic , but it was showing Foreground when report was executed.IF SY-BATCH = 'X'. WRITE: 'BACKGROUND'. ELSE. WRITE: 'FOREGROUND'. ENDIF.2) While Batch-job is running , Does my system need to should active at that time ?
If you have created a very simple executable program (A.K.A. "report") as below, activated it, submitted it as a "background job", that you can see in SM37, then it should generate a spool request with content "BACKGROUND".
If not, you are not in the exact situation described above.

Hello,
I have few question regarding the acknowledgement receipt and Cover sheet in Automatic Report shipping. Since they are related to same functionality of report shipping, they are grouped in this thread.
1) Is it possible to generate cover sheet in multiple language? 
While generating shipping order for Germany, it has attached two SDS Reports that is in EN & DE, but cover sheet is generated only in EN language. 
2) Is it necessary to have acknowledgement receipt for at least one shipping reason? This is because, while I did not selected the Acknowledgement receipt check box in customization for any shipping reason, still it showed error as missing 'Ack Receipt' in the flow trace of CVD1. This error occurred only for SUB_CALL and not for SD_CALL though for both shipping reason Ackn Recipt check box was unchecked in IMG.
While going through IMG doc for ' Assign Templates: cover sheet/ Ackn of Receipt' it says

The was resolved only when an Acknowledge Template was assigned to SUB_CALL.
3) I want to display Product name in acknowledgement receipt. For this, I inserted the same Rep symbol which is used in Cover sheet for Material name, but it is not expanded and no value displayed in Acknowledgement receipt generated. Where as other symbol for receiver address is expanded and the values are displayed. 

Your comments are welcome.
Ashish
Dear Ashish 
i can not help for all your topics now. 
1.) CoverSheet in many language => never investigated. I do not believe it is possible The "G Group" can not be used (i would assume). From legal point of view: the recipient is using a "main language". So to send the CoverSheet in one language is (from my point of view) ok.
2. acknowledgement Letter: Never investigated here. I have not get in touch with one company using this option in report shipment.
3.) Product name: in CVD1 the material name need not to to be presented (if you try to check the CoverSheet). But if you check "SOST" or check the "print": It is printed.  So check "SOST" or print result of your Cover Sheet; i would assume: Material name is available
In a nutshell: it is (from my point of view9 bst Practise to list material number and or material name in the CoverSheet and on our side: It does work without problems
C.B.
Hello Ashish,
1) Multiple languages are not supported for cover sheets, as far as I know
2) It is not mandatory to send a cover sheet. If you don't want to send one, leave customizing in "Assign Cover sheets and AoR" empty
3). It is the right symbol, but is the value maintained (table CVDPACKAGE, field MATNAM)?

Hello

Our user has updated the bank statement through FF67 with the processing type (under specification) is 1. However, before posting the FI document, he found some error and has deleted the batch under T.code SM35.

Now we are trying to generate the one more batch through FF67 but, we are facing the following probelm. Please note that, i have tried by changing the specification through Settings -> Specifications -> Processing Type - 1, 2,3 and 4. However i am getting the same error message.

Cannot post. Processing status not correct
Message no. FV010

Diagnosis
The processing status of the statement/list is 8. The system, however, can post only statements/lists with processing status 2 (entered) or 3 (revised).

Procedure
Go into statement/list processing and save again. The processing status is then changed to 3 (revised).

Kindly suggest me the way out to overcome the above problem

Regards

Anilkumar
Hi,

Use T Code FF67,

Select the Check deposit list and click enter. Now go to Settings > Specifications

Here you will find the "Processing Status" for you to continue.

maintain as 3.

Edited by: Pankaj Bhalerao on Sep 1, 2010 12:20 PM
Hi,

Go to FEBA / FEBA_BANK_STATEMENT and check whether that statement is already there.

If yes, then you can correct the statement posting there and can post.
Alternatively, note the statement ID here and delete the statement in transaction SE38 > RFEBKA96 program.
(Give Application no. as 0001 and ID as statement IS obtained from FEBA / FEBA_BANK_STATEMENT.)

Hi Gurus,
I am implementing a long term planning (LTP) with the process industry client.
When I run the LTP, the system takes the first active production version for the calculation of MRP and capacity planning.
The problem is the client has a specified set of BOM and recipe combination for each finished good. But we are not going to change the first active production version because it will impact their day to day operations.
Is there any way we can specify which BOM and recipe to be used for LTP, without using the production versions.

Dear Gurus：
 I am helping my customer to implement some new regulations and requirement recently, the customer is the first and only customer adopting our PS&S solution in China right now.
In 2021 they implemented basic functions like REACH, and this year they initialed another project to optimize old functionalities and implement some new regulations.
The system version they are using is S4/HANA OP.
They have some requirements seem to be hard to fulfill, so I wonder if you could give me some ideas or help.
Detailed requirements are as follows:
（1）For different regulations they have different restrictions on impurities:
DSL(Canada) & AIIC(Australia): impurities can be exempted no matter how much the concentration is. 
IESCS (China): the concentration of single impurity less than 10% and the overall concentration of all impurities in one composition less than 20% can be exempted.
REACH: the concentration of single impurity less than 1% and the overall concentration of all impurities in one composition less than 20% can be exempted.
KECI(South Korea): the overall concentration of all impurities in one composition less than 20% can be exempted.(They don't have restrictions on single impurity's concentration)
Anyway, my ideal solution is to create a Impurities Management customer table which user can maintain all the restrictions there, but where can I enhance those logic into the expert rule? I mean the notification status of the real substance is determined by the expert rule using all the data in its composition. What is the specific user exit I can make use to fulfill this solution?

(2) SVT control by a group of companies.
For some company, they register the quantities using one company code, but they have a lot of other company codes to sell the products, and the SVT monitor&control should be based on the group of the company codes, not a single one. (My understanding of SVT so far is all the SVT data is aggregated using company code, and the error messages in sales order, the data is also aggregated by company code)
 My solution is to create a table mapping the register company code and other company codes who are going to consume those quantities, so please tell me the user exit I can use to fulfill this requirement or is there any standard functions I just missed.

(3) China REACH 
For China REACH, the quantities should be monitor&tracked based on the supplier, so I can create a table for customer to maintain the supplier monitor quantities, but is there any chance I can show the data divided by supplier in SVT report and also using the data to control the purchase order?
Look forward to your replies.
Thanks in advance.
Hello
regarding
（1）For different regulations they have different restrictions on impurities:
You should not go on with your proposal/Ideas (from my point of view: tehy will not hel you on long term). "impurities" should be handled as part of the "composition" maintenance. How this achieved depends on the company acting. Some companies are using "rulesets" to support this demand. OVerall: you can find a solution but it is 100% customer specific and therefore nobody can really help (i would assume)
regarding
(2) SVT control by a group of companies.
You use (from my perspective)  the "wrong" approach. SVT is designed to control if or if not a threshold limit is exceeded by company code and tracked substance
in SAP MM/PP/SD: the process is based on "company code". There is no "user exit" you can use (not that i could list here an "exit" to be used); but there are many other options to handle the demand. The problem is: what should be achieved?
Example: CAS number x is "tracked" with company code A; CAS number X is as well tracked by company code "B"; registration is done by company code e.g. A. So the "monitored" values of company code B need to be added to the amount of A.
Using SAP transaction CBRc20 you will see this: The "color" (green, yellow etc. = threshold limit is exceeded) is calculated by "regulation" / "Company code" and "tracked substance". Here you can use own coding to change that. BUt here you can just "add" all the values together (if you are not interested in the "green", "Yellow" etc. color). As this (CBRC20) is an ALV view: this is easy to do here.
But i am not sure if this solution will really fit the demand
regarding:
(3) China REACH
For China REACH, the quantities should be monitor&tracked based on the supplier, so I can create a table for customer to maintain the supplier monitor quantities, but is there any chance I can show the data divided by supplier in SVT report and also using the data to control the purchase order?
the "problem" is the definition: who is the "Supplier". in SAP MM you use (form SVT perspective) two important roles. The supplier and the goods supplier. SVT internally you need frist to define: which of both is "relevant" (there is a core customizing to do so).
By using "clever" tricks (and extend a lot SVT) you can get the wished result. I am not allowed to share the "clever" tricks. But it is possible but huge development.
C.B.
Hello
you should not wait for an "ABAPer", for some of the user demand: i can onl provide feedback (as an example): the topic of "impurity" and REACH is not correct. It is not "simply" allowed to ignore impurities.
Here the company acting should really discuss with a legal expert.
For South Korea: the same is true. Situation i differencet for "CA". For "AU" and "CN": i am not aware of any option to ignore "impurities" (but i am not a legal expert).
In most of the regulations you have listed: we can ignore the "sell" process. Most of the regulations are looking on "import" and production only. So i have some doubts as well regarding the "group of company" idea.
But we need to differentiate the SAP topic from the legal topic. The SVT process is designed to be very flexible to support many kind of demands. But yes: the "China" demand is quite tricky to solve.
C.B.
Hello
regarding your topic:
Anyway, my ideal solution is to create a Impurities Management customer table which user can maintain all the restrictions there, but where can I enhance those logic into the expert rule? 
I mean the notification status of the real substance is determined by the expert rule using all the data in its composition. What is the specific user exit I can make use to fulfill this solution?
May be somt hints here
We have the following options: you buy "expert rules" or you create them by your own.
If you use SAP standard: I am not aware of a "good" option to make a link a "customer specific" table (your topic of "user exit").
From sequence point of view: first you must define a "composition". If needed you can use additional "expert rule" to optimize the "composition"
The "Notification Status" as such is based on many data in the property tree (e.g. is there a "restriction" yes or no); but the starting point is the "Composition" (whatever composition you define).
But if you have prepared a robust data model: it is clear, that by using some expert rules, you can derive whatever kind of "Notification Status".
As "legal regulations" change... and providers sometimes react on such changes.. may be get in touch with 3E/Verisk to ask if they plan to deliver a "expert rule" as part of their services to fulfill the legal demand as listed by you.  if they provide: than you avoid to generate your own rule and you can use "Best practis" procedures in your EHS environment.
C.B.
Dear Lucas
i would be interested in the feedback of 3E. May be you can share the feedback here on "high level". 
But as explained. you need to get in touch with a legal expert for the regulations of your intereste. For REACH: i am not aware of any option to exclude "impurities (but i am not an legal expert); for Canada: yes you can exclude "impurtities" (to my knowledge)

I have a problem when using SAP EventMesh with CAP. Sometime in the days, we saw that the app stop to process the event. The Queue number just keep increase, but none has been take. The only way is to restart the CAP service. We found that the Webhook said Handshake Failed. We tried to trace back the log of the CAP, but none errors log so far.
My question is, what can cause the Handshake Failed for the Event Mesh Webhook, and how to prevent it? We can't manually restart the CAP service all the time.
The CAP project is using @sap/cds version 6.4.0 (NodeJS 16)
Hi Andrew Mai, 
when configuring the webhook on EM side, did you set the "Exempt Handshake" option to true? If not, you need to implement the handshake mechanism in your CAP app: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_EM/bf82e6b26456494cbdd197057c09979f/387a7e03feb24f6bb154ab1170e45eee.html
Another option: can't your CAP app subsrcibe to Event Mesh for event consumption? So you don't have to push the messages to your app, but your app subscribes to the interesting events: https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/messaging/#using-sap-event-mesh

I am trying to setup a CAP project having one app router module , one db module and multiple service modules . I am making use of .cdsrc.json file to make this work . 
I renamed srv folder to service1 . I will have then other directories service2 , service3 etc. MTA.yaml is adjusted to locate gen/service1 . 
I uploaded the project here
within service1 , I have another directory "sd" , inside which I have a Service.cds annotated with 
@(impl : './ProductService.js')
As per documentation , ./ must locate the file from same directory where the cds is located. 
When I am running this locally from BAS , this file is loaded and works as expected. After deployment , it throws an error 

I have an index.cds as well. 
Is it something wrong with my mta / cdsrc ? 
Or is it that "srv" directory is something reserved and must be there in all cap projects ? 
Doesn't cap framework support my original requirement ? which is to have multiple service instances with in . 
Sreehari 

Renaming of a folder for a single db, srv or app module can be achieved by simply changing the cds configuration in .cdsrc.json or package.json: 
As this configuration is read by cds build and cds runtime no further changes are required, e.g. there is no need for configuring dedicated build tasks. You may want to check the executed build tasks logged to the console.This only works for a single db, srv or app module. For your scenario with multiple service modules, you have to configurecorresponding build tasks - one for each service module and one to generate the required hana artifacts. In such a scenario you have to define an absolute @impl path for each service - absolute paths are resolved based on theroot folder (the folder containing the package.json file) of the enclosing application (service1, service2, ...).
E.g. for the service definition service1/sd/Service.cds (by default the srv module folder is defined as 'srv', see above:
For the deployed application it will be resolved to: /home/vcap/app//home/vcap/app/service1/srv/sd/ProductService.js
You can test correct service resolution locally by executing cds run in the folder gen/service1 of your application after you have executed npm install in that folder.

Hi , 
I have a CAP project with custom build task( reason is here ) . Now when I add mtx to this project and "cds build" it, it throws this error 
package.json has multi-tenancy enabled as well . Any clue ? 
 Lothar Bender 
=>to fix the errors, I added the below 4 models in the cdsrs.json , and error goes of. service has /-/cds/ endpoints as well . But subscription fails ( with no error I could spot from logs )  "@sap/cds-mtxs/srv/bootstrap", "@sap/cds-mtxs/srv/model-provider", "@sap/cds-mtxs/srv/deployment-service", "@sap/cds-mtxs/db/extensions"
  Sreehari 

Seems that you've also set extensibility: true which requires the model @sap/cds-mtxs/db/extensions. This model defines the extensions table (cds.xt.Extensions) which holds the information of existing extensions. 
Extensibility should only be enabled if required - just set it to false otherwise.
If this is not the case, please add the .cdsrc.json and package.json files including the one from the sidecar which is mandatory for Java. - Lothar

What could be it ? I am not sure where to locate logs for this. 
Sree 

This was an oversight in the yaml file. xsappname property of the saas-registry service was different than the xsappname of the associated xsuaa service .I was in the impression of a need of unique xsappname for the saas-registry service. 
apparently this property connectes the saas-registry to the associated "shared" xsuaa service . Fixing that , resolved the issue.

Hello,
I am trying to find all Organizational Units in OM which are not assigned to a cost center. Of course I can do this manually with HRP1001, or using Function RH_STRUC_GET I can go along the hierarchy and check individual Org Units for cost center assignments. This however would take a lot of time, so I was thinking that maybe there is a standard report that can display all Org Units which don't have a Cost Center assignment?
Any help or tips are greatly appreciated.
Hi All,

Currently when we generate the account statement in F.27 for a range of customer, then the system generated the statement for all the customers.

We want to block certain customer from account statement creation like dunning block or payment block.

What could be the way out?

Hi,

Go to the below path:-
SPRO > Financial Accounting (new) > Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable > Line Items > Correspondence > Define Period Types for Customers
Here define two indicators u2013 1 for generating and 2 for not generating

Then in the customer master data for company code > correspondence tab > field u201CAccount statementu201D, 
you can select the Indicator for periodic account statements 2 for those customer for which you do not want any statement. 

Now when you run F.27 it will process statements based on the Indicator for periodic account statements and will exclude the customers will indicator 2.

Regards,
Gaurav

Hello all,
I am trying to assign Personas Flavors to users through roles. I have assigned the Flavor to the roles and made it default:

My user, AMOLINA, is assigned to the role

With that, I expected that when I opened the Slipstream Personas I would see the Flavor and not the default screen, but I still see the default screen

I am not sure what's missing. 
Any ideas what's wrong here?
Thanks 
Andréa
From the Personas flavor assignment side, that looks OK. 
Just wondering if it makes a difference to run the user comparison in PFCG so the light turns green instead of the current red. Perhaps the role assignment is not 100% complete, causing a problem?
Another possibility is that you have the Original Screen set at the individual user level as the default, which will override the default flavor coming from the role assignments. If so, you can use the 'Reset Role Assignments, Default flavor' function for your user in the Admin transaction and see if that fixes the issue.

The issue is when Work Orders are rescheduled to the next Fiscal year the Total Planned costs is moved to that year on the WBS 'Assigned' even though there has been some Actual expenditure done in the previous year.
Example:
WBS Element has a 2021 Annual budget of $500,000. A Work order that is scheduled in that year has a PO raised at $450,000 and some Labour at $20,000 so the Planned Cost for the WO is $470,000 which is under the budget amount for the year.
From a WBS reporting prospective
WBS Budget = $500,000
Actual = $0
Commitment = $450,000
Rem Ord Plan = $20,000
When the PO is Goods Receipted the Actual changes to $450,000 and Commitment = $0
The Work Order is now postponed and will be carried out in Fiscal Year 2022. 
A WBS Element Budget for 2022 is set at $50,000 because that will cover the work required. The goods are on site and available so the Work Order is rescheduled to 2022 but it cannot be saved because there are insufficient funds for 2022.
The issue is when you reschedule a Work Order to the next Fiscal year it moves the total Planned cost of the Work Order which in this case is $470,000. It doesn't take into account any expenditure in previous years.
When I turned off the Budget control and rescheduled the Work Order the WBS Reporting was this for 2022
WBS Budget = $50,000
Actual = $0
Commitment = $0
Rem Ord Plan = $470,000
I am sure someone out there has this issue and because the budgets are controlled yearly it is very difficult to manage these Work Orders when things change.
I know if we report by Overall Budget Value it calculates correctly but it is more about the Budget control that is in place and how SAP assigns the Work Order total Planned costs. I would have thought the calculation would have taken into account any actual expenditure on the Work order.
Has anyone come across this issue? Any ideas on how to resolve would be much appreciated.
Hi Graham,
Maybe I am mistaken as cannot simulate quickly in my current system, but I believe ROP is set to zero upon TECO. Would that be an option to set TECO once all procurement activity is complete?
Kind regards,
Paulo
Hi Paulo,
That is correct the ROP will reduce to zero upon TECO but the work hasn't been done. In some case the users are doing that as a work around so they can get a Work Order inside the yearly budget.
What they do is TECO the Work Order that purchased the material then create a new Work Order for the labour. This isn't very efficent.
Thanks Paulo I will look into the User status idea
Below using a project report shows what is happening. If this is the way SAP treats this ROP I am looking for ideas or ways people have managed this change to ROP
This report shows the ROP at $112,560

The WO in question has actual spend at this point which has consumed most of the Planned Cost which give you the ROP correctly

The WO assigned to that WBS is rescheduled to the next Fiscal year


Now the ROP is the total of the Planned Cost of the WO which in turn has increase the Assigned Total

This is what I'm trying to understand why the ROP has increased in alignment with the WO Planned Cost when there has already been Actual costing. My assumption is it should have stayed at $112k because that is what is left for that WBS.
Hi all,
Seems that some of you are familiar with the error that Im facing
One WBS was created on 2022, some Pur Orders were created with that WBS, now in 2023 we need to pay some of these Invoices against these PurOrders but we have the following error
"Fiscal Year 2023 is not allowed" Message F5568
Diagnosis "The fiscal year entered (2023) is different from the fiscal year derived from the posting date and fiscal year variant (2022)"
could you share with me some advice ?
kind regards

But I could not find a table reference for free char - in one of the blogs, its mentioned to refer RSZELTXREF - where "Select the TELTUID Of the record which has LAYTP = ‘SHT’. Use the TELTUID as SELTUID to get the list of all the cross references " but I could not find it. Am i missing some step ? 
can anyone please confirm if I am doing incorrect ?

Hi Experts,
The response to the question below states that the master data should be export/imported across enviroments.
There's no transport method for this, and this is the SAP approach?
https://answers.sap.com/questions/13553553/what-are-the-cut-over-activities-in-group-reportin.html
Thank you in advance.
Regards
Eyal
Hi Eyal,
Yes this is true.
Don't know if any from SAP can confirm also.
But in addition to the list in the blog all your consolidation hierarchies need to be part of the manual cut-over as well.
That would be your: Consolidation Unit hierarchies, Reporting Item hierarchies, Consolidation Posting Level Hierarchies etc.
Consolidation Group and assignments are not part of the transport either.
What I do is to make sure my cut-over excel sheet are maintained so every build task that do not tricker an transport request gets into the list.
And just as a side note. If you also implement 40Y intercompany: matching rules and reconciliation cases do not prompt for transport request but are added to transport request from CXE9N (SPRO and group reporting).
Br
Martin Jul
Correct. Group Reporting master data can't be transported automatically. Only export and import from the client to the client during the cutover phase.
Validations. Validation methods and selection ID can be imported via provided app and imported directly into a new client.
ICMR Methods and Recon cases be transported depends on your configuration
We're experiencing issues with Business One generating an excessive amount of log files from the DIAPI. These log files are pulling the names from add-ons as the header title for the csv files. We've gotten to a point where they are developing a script to continuously move and delete thousands of log files in order for their B1 system to not be affected.
Currently on version 9.2 of B1, has there been any improvements in the versions after 9.2 to the DIAPI that would resolve this log file issue? And have you seen this problem before? I’m looking to get some information on why this could tie into their c-drive corrupting their OS. 
Dear Experts,
We are using subitem category 7 for transaction types and 8 for functional areas. In our case, when we use a PL account broken down functional area to reclass into a balance sheet account, the subitem category, subitem and transaction type fields are populated as expected, however we are also getting the functional area field populated. I was expecting that in these type of situations, functional area would not get populated since it is a balance sheet account.
Is that normal/standard behavior? Once caviat is that in this reclassification scenario, we are not posting to the triggering cons unit but using the "post to any cons unit" option in which we specify which entity to recieve the reclass postings. Would that cause this behaviour since in this case, we are also seeing the triggering cons unit show up as partner unit in the reclassification posting?
Thanks in advance!
The functional area should not be populated in the B/S Accounts. please do the following.
- Check/Run the breakdown category for B/S accounts
-Release the universal journal data and run the universal journal validations
Let me know if this works, if not we need to see the DB Hints in the data release process.
Are UI customization questions appropriate for this forum? I find knockoutjs difficult to grasp, so my question is rudimentary. NOTE: "pavId" is an ID unique to each Product Attribute Value - so it's an excellent hook to use in templates to highlight specific values. Yes, I plan on outsourcing the list of IDs to a custom table and modifying the code to do a lookup instead of referring to a bunch IDs, but that's all after this proof of concept.Checkbox values are easy to style based on pavId, because they are generated with a FOR loop and so the condition can be inserted right into the responsive template:

But drop downs are trickier. Although they show up as individual elements in the DOM (seen in browser inspector)

In HTML, they are actually (i think?) created with knockout's data-bind attribute in the <select> element:

In the browser inspector, I can see the pavId's for all the options, so I know the data is there:
So there has to be a way to generate the <option> elements, where some of them with certain pavId's will come in with an element ID (e.g. "SpecialValue") to differentiate them from the rest, like so:
I can then apply a style (on line 8) to those distinct elements based on that element ID:
Can anyone point me in the right direction? I assume I need change the something in the data-bind attribute value?Thank you!
Requirements
Through users hierarchy setup, only one approver can be selected.
- e.g. Our current set up through the user's profile is Approving Parent = Sales Approver, Managing Parent = Finance Approver, Ordering Parent= Service Approver.
There are users who can quote across markets, and depending on the market it should go to Approver A, but if in Market B. the approval should be sent to Approver B. 
What are available options that could support this type of functionality?
Hi Stephanie,
You can achieve this type of functionality by using the Custom Approver Selection Logic feature of CPQ. You can find this when setting up the approval rule. 
For example, you could write a formula in this custom selection logic to pull the email, username, or full name (whichever you specify) of the desired approver from a quote custom field. Then set up logic on the quote level to populate that custom field with the desired email, username, or full name of the approver based on market, etc. 
Hope this helps!

Hi Experts 
We have identified SAP provided Service API_CNSLDTNGRPJRNLENTR as part of 2209 upgrade for on-Prem system, which has post action to insert data into ACDOCU table. 
the limitation of this service is that it does not support update to custom fields added to ACDOCU.
My requirement is to post Reclass data from Data Monitor/Consolidation Monitor BADIs to ACDOCU.
Need your expertise to understand if there is any way RAP model can still be used to post the data to ACDOCU or is there any other method that can be leveraged
I have gone through the documentation around Custom table updates using V2/V4 UI based services. However, i am looking for the options to update Standard table(with Append Structure)

We created one customized ABAP program for Reclassification, based on the logic given the system reclassifies and generates the Flex upload file to push the data via Data Collection App to ACDOCU in Data Monitor.

Hi All,
Currently in our group reporting system, we have some Intercompany elimination accounts for which specific Offset accounts also set. 
Please see below:

Here, you can see that for 4XX series and 5XX series, our offset accounts are 489199 and 529199. When Intercompany elimination is happening, the data is showing as below in the report:

The issue what we are facing here is --> 5XX series offset account is having functional area/subitem as 1000 which is a revenue subitem in GR. We don't want to showcase any 5XX series FS items having revenue subitem (1000 in current GR system), it should be present only for COGS subitem (5000 in current GR system).
We have done some validation rules for subitem as below: But it is working only when there is any top side journal getting posted.


Is there any way we can default the subitem for intercompany offset accounts?
Regards,
Ayan
The Substitution rules are applicable for only manual posting. 
If you have a specific requirement to post the Offset account with a certain subitem ( e.g Functional area), then you have the option to default the subitems it in the reclassification method itself. Check the below screenshot.
Let me know this works.

Hi All
When serving a UI with Fiori Elements (sap.fe.templates, SAPUI5 Version 1.81.0) based on a CAP CDS Service, is it possible to change Number Format Settings?
For example for a Number (CDS Type Integer) to be formatted without thousands separator?
Best regards,Ben
Hi Tim and BenI faced this issue as well when trying to display a column representing a year. 
I needed the @UI.LineItem to display e.g. 2021, but it displayed 2,021 instead.
I couldn't find a native CAP solution yet, so I ended up with the workaround of adding a custom column:
Introduce a custom column yearColumn.fragment.xml:
along with a formatter NumberToUnformattedString.js:
and register the custom column in manifest.json, under the corresponding targets entry, in the subpath options > settings:
I worked around the problem by creating a service that returned two columns: the integer (order number in my case) as well as the string representation of the integer. The CDS looked something like this
In my first attempt, I tried
This worked whenever I created new entity instances, but it broke whenever I tried to update the instance. Adding the cast to the new column in addition to typing it as String resolved the problem.

Hello All,
I want to map the output parameter with Dynamic sql variable out_tab
Exec 'out_tab =' || select * from temp';
Please assist
Thanks
Nagendra 
Hi Negenda,
You follow a code like below:
YOUR_TABLE_TYPE should be replaced with the appropriate type for your table. You'll also need to modify the SELECT statement in the cursor declaration to retrieve those columns you need from the temp table.
The OPEN statement opens the cursor, and the FETCH statement retrieves the first row of results into the out_tab variable. The WHILE loop processes each row of results as needed until there are no more rows to fetch. The SQLSTATE variable is used to check if the fetch was successful or not. If the fetch was successful, the value of SQLSTATE will be '00000'. If the fetch failed, the value of SQLSTATE will be different.
Finally, the CLOSE statement closes the cursor.
Hope this helps,
Hello Experts,
I am trying to display information in a table, it must be grouped by Date (which would be the "MonthYear" field) and in the header of that table, the Subtotal would be displayed, from the Value column (The data is "SubTotal")
but I can't get it like this, since it appears like this
I am trying to sort the table by the MonthYear Field, but instead of showing the MonthYear, I need to show the value of another field, in this case SubTotal, since it is requested to add all the values by month, of the Value field and show it in the board.
Something like that(the image is only illustrative)I was also told that it could be with another type of table, but I did not find any table or example of it, to be able to do it.
Any idea how it could be done?This is the code of my table in xml
<m:Table items="{ path: '/d/results', sorter: { path: 'MesAno', group: '.getCounty'}, groupHeaderFactory: '.getGroupHeader' }" id="tabla_Actividades" growing="true" growingScrollToLoad="true">
and here how I get the filter in the controller
 getCounty: function(oContext) { return oContext.getProperty('SubTotal'); }, getGroupHeader: function(oGroup) { return new GroupHeaderListItem({ title : oGroup.key } ); }, I'm honestly pretty lost with this.input with the sap.ui.table is it possible to do that?Or do you have an example of another table that I can use? 
I would appreciate any help or message you can give me. 
Greetings.

Hi Edson, 
I would suggest perhaps looking at the Tree Table for your example, which renders the expandable nodes based on your data structure. In your case, the properties date and subtotal could be hierarchy #1, followed by the items inside with hierarchy #2 that displays all other values on this level.
Please see the below example;
Tree Table Documentation
You can read more about the Tree Table to see if it fits your use case also from a UX perspective here; 
Tree Table Fiori 
You will however need to adjust your OData Service for these changes or manipulate it via JSONModel which is then bound to your table in the view. 
We are using a separate web app running in it's own Tomcat8 to connect to Business Objects BI 4.3 using the BI 4.3 Java SDK
As part of the BI 4.3 install, we needed to copy 3 new files to our web app's Tomcat8/bin/ folder : sapcrypto.dll, slcryptokernel.dll and slcryptokernel.dll.sha256. In addition, we also copied sapjce.jar to our web app's Tomcat8/lib/ext/ folder
However, when we stop and restart our web app's Tomcat8, we can see in the web app's log files that the web app has started, but Tomcat8 won't allow users to access the web app's UI at all.
The hack / work-around is to stop our web app's Tomcat8, then we MOVE sapcrypto.dll out of the Tomcat8/bin/ folder to some temp folder, start up Tomcat8, wait for both Tomcat8 and our web app to start, then MOVE sapcrypto.dll back to our web app's Tomcat8/bin/ folder. Once that is done, our web app can start up and allows users to see the UI, and the web app can start interacting just fine with Business Objects BI 4.3 using Java SDK.
We are hoping to find a better way for our web app's Tomcat8 to stop and restart WITHOUT requiring us to move the sapcrypto.dll before and after the Tomcat8 start.

I have a user who was responsible for mapping G/L accounts in financial statement versions. She mistakenly mapped a balance sheet G/L account to a profit/loss node in FSV. Now she wants to rectify the mistake. I know we can reassign accounts to nodes in FSV, but can we reassign accounts after the fiscal year is closed? If not, do we need to reopen the fiscal year first? 
If there is no specific custom control, you can reassign accounts/update FSV without any limitation of financial years, postings etc. FSV is just a structure to get reports. It has no effect on transactional data. 
Good Day! I am investigating the capabilities of Detailed Scheduling. Today, we have the capability to color the operations based on a predefined RGB characteristic on the material. Does Detailed Scheduling have this capability? 
1. We would like the color of the operation to be filled based on an RGB characteristic on the material (or perhaps by some other mean)
2. I'm thinking that we would play with the font to determine whether it's a planned order versus process order and their different statuses. 
Any direction/help is greatly appreciated!
Hi,
This can be done through planning board configuration. The material characteristic can be like production planner or and other material attribute. As well as you can differentiate between planned and process order through configuration.
Hint: Write logic using planning board profile configuration.

I need to create a composite task in analytics designer, but I want to have a team (not a single user, and not an array of users), as its assignee. I also want to have a team as its reviewer.
I have already made this in the calendar, so I know that "manually" this is possible. But I need to do this by programming. The system does not allow special characters in assignees / reviewers, like ":", so "TEAM:NAME" (where NAME is the team name) does not work.
Is there any way to achieve this?
Thank you very much in advance,
Tito
Dear experts!
Firstly please, can anyone share an example of BAPI call using a table as an importing parameter?
Secondly, can you please share a custom script of BAPI call with a table (as above)? Both examples should be for cloud studio. 
Thank you very much.
Kind regards, JV
Hi Jan,
Hereby an example we're using :) 

importDataMapped is a specific type, which corresponds to the importing fields of the BAPI. In this case we have the Item & itemx table mapped with the data needed. 

The custom script is mainly mapping all the data to the needed fields and adding them to the table. 

sap is the "main" variable which contains every import field / table / structure. The output of the script is the type we created for this. 
Kind Regards
Jana
Hello Jana,
Thank you very much for your kind answer and an example. I believe I have a very similar settings. Import_param structure is simplified for this example only:

It is filled in from an internal variable of type array. The variable name of this step is BAPIInput.

The params are passed to BAPI within BAPI SDK ver 1.26.74 as Import params successfully


While in BAPI SDK 1.30.69 it fails, and I cannot get an explanation from SAP IRPA DevOps team. I believe this is an inconsistency between core SAP and SAP IRPA BAPI SDK functionality.



Any hint about it?
Thank you very much.
Jan
I found a solution. Just cycling among items collection and adding one by one to the List type variable using Add Item (List) activity.
Cheers, JV
Hello!
I am struggling with RPA BAPI call importing a simple array.
On the SAP side BAPI has IT_D param type table having one column DELN.
On the IRPA side import_param data type contains IT_D object with DELN child (string, list).
Now I am trying to pass the values from iRPA to BAPI. I created myVariable with import_param type, but I cannot assign IT_D nor DELN to array successfully. 
Does anybody know, how to pass array to BAPI?
Hi
Did you figure out the solution for this issue? Facing a similar issue where I need to pass parameters as an array. It would be helpful if you could share how you solved it.
Regards.
Hi,
Cycle among items collection and use Add Item (List) activiy to fill in table param type.
Or negotiate with your SAP developer (if possible) to create a custom BAPI specific for you.
Cheers. JV
I have created the service instance for PostgreSQL hyperscaler option in our BTP. Following are the steps I followed.
 1. Created PostgreSQL hyperscaler instance


Generated the service Key


3.

When I try to connect to the database using pgadmin, it is showing time out error.



I have also tried creating the SSL tunnel and service key and try to login with credentials also. But this is also giving the error "Connection refused: connect"



Please help me in connecting the postgreSQL instance. May I thank you in anticipation.
Mujeeb C
Postgre is accessible within in BTP network ports provided. you cannot access directly from your local db clients.
Hi Mujeeb C,
You could open a tunnel to your database via cloud foundry CLI:
https://blogs.sap.com/2018/04/27/how-to-use-an-ssh-tunnel-with-scp-cloud-foundry-backing-service/
And then use local tools to connect to a local port that will be tunneled to BTP's service.

How do you remove the grey gridlines in a webi report table for BOBJ 4.3? I can do this in 4.2 but can't find the option in 4.3.
Hi,
You mean the cell border? If so, it's in the side pane called "Show Data/format panel".You can also apply the changes using a multi selection on the table cells with Control or Shift key.
Then press the "None" border button.
Thanks.

When you create a table, you get the standard gray table lines as seen below. I figured it out, but the only way to remove them is to add borders and then take them away. The previous versions of BOBJ had a setting to remove the gridlines, 4.3 doesn't have this setting.

Hi,
Here is the Scenario:
I have three KPI's as "A","B","C". Formula to calculate them is:
A = B + C
B= User Input
C = Previous Month of A.
Please refer below screenshot:

I'm defining the formula at model level but I'm getting an error of circular reference as A and C are inter dependent. The same calculation can be achieved in excel but it is surprising that in SAC I'm facing some challenges.
 Is there a way to achieve this calculation via calculated / restricted measures at story level? Anyone who has faced similar kind of issue or knows the workaround for this case. Their comments would be deeply appreciated.Thanks
Al Zaib Mohd
Any calculated Account measure referencing itself directly or indirectly through other calculated member will result in cyclic error. You can try calculating [C] though a Data Action and then just do A= B+C in model or story.

Hi,
We are initiating workflows on Cloud Foundry using a technical user. This works fine after having enabled technical authentication, but the workflow instances are showing the Client ID of the technical user as the "Started By" on the workflow tile.
This is not only a cosmetic problem but also a security issue (we do not want these client ID's visible of course). What is the approach to set a proper "Started By" tag on technically initiated workflows? We have been trying payloads like this:
{
    "definitionId": "myworkflow",
    "startedBy": "Postman Pat",
    "context": {
        "MyContextField": "MyData" 
    }
}

But the inbox still gets the ClientID's as started by

Thanks
//Carl
Hello - I believe we have to use the authorization code grant rather than client credentials to authenticate. Please see below link: 
https://help.sap.com/viewer/e157c391253b4ecd93647bf232d18a83/Cloud/en-US/9edeb36db8aa4628be092328e8810e5e.html

Hi Carl,
with respect to the My Inbox, you can configure the display with custom attributes using reserved names:
https://help.sap.com/viewer/e157c391253b4ecd93647bf232d18a83/Cloud/en-US/417d14cc4d1e4c749bb085c19a80bb8e.html
So CustomCreatedBy in your case, I suppose.
However, in the technical monitoring tools, you cannot overwrite the startedBy. They are anyway not meant for a wider audience, but rather workflow administrators only.
A similar solution to what Srinivas points out could also be to start a workflow with the OAuth2 Password Grant. You could use a technical user whose ID (usually email address) is anyway fine for others to see, for example workflow@example.com

Either you're using wrong ODBC driver (MySQL instead of Oracle) or you're connecting to the wrong DB.

Hello Team
In our project,Sales order is mostly created through batch job,but it has been seen that sales orders has been created successfully followed with PGI ,but at the point of billing,it shows incompleted due to missiling net value in either one or two line item.It gets auto deleted.
This will happen once only in 20 invoice creations as its rare of rarest which we are completeing through LSMW,but client is looking towards the permanent fix.
The major points here we can not reproduce in error in testing environment as it happens sometimes only so that technical team can debug.
Hence requesting you to kindly suggest here the possible option of exploring the root cause.of net value of any line deletion at the point of creating billing either technically or through OSS notes
The root cause is at sale order creation which you have not explained how it is created in mass / which Bapi. So try to process with the same steps in DEV and I am sure, at some point of time, you will be able to find out the root cause.  Also, the line item can go for incompletion log which is normal but should never be deleted whichever Bapi you use.  So, I presume, some custom validation is there to create billing document.
Hello Team
Still this issue is not resolved

Can you please share me if any OSS notes available
As I already said, since it is happening randomly, it has to be find out only via debut mode.  With the standard configuration, due to incompletion log, no line items will get deleted either in sale order or billing.  In your case, if that is happening, then, you need to set a Breakpoint before executing the transaction and check where exactly the issue is happening.
I want to allow only certain users to access various pages of the application depending on their role? How to do that?
When a user doesn't have access to any page, that page should not appear along with some kind of message to the user that they are not authorized to use that function or view that page. If we need to write any rule for it, please help us with the same.
Another requirement is, only certain users can delete the data from pages. How to restrict particular users to delete or edit the data on pages?
It will depend on your application design requirements.  One option is as you mentioned to show the feature with an appropriate error about authorization.  Another would be to hide the feature if the current user does not permissions to execute it or possibly make a field read only with a helper text message.  It is all based on your design requirements.
From the MDK app perspective this will entail using rules to check the current user authorization against what is needed and hide / block access based on the result.  There is no default role access model provided out of the box as it depends on how you are defining those roles or personas.  
The key things is where in the backend system are you mapping users to roles / personas and how does the MDK application look that up?  Is there a table in the backend?  a User Parameter? a role in the Identity Provider? Once you have that defined, you can then create common library functions to check access that can be reused across multiple rules / locations in your application.
Hi Kranti,
one way how you can achieve this is to fetch the assigned IDP user groups of the user which is currently signed in. Please check following page for more details on the API : https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/features/user-information/api/client.html
Here is an example for a JS rule which returns the assigned user groups:

In SAP Hana, we have a requirement to display number of times a query has been executed by any user, could be real user or system user or service account user from BO reports. We saw few monitoring views like M_SQL_PLAN_CACHE,M_EXECUTED_STATEMETNS,HOST_SQL_PLAN_CACHE but we could not find the queries fired by all users. 
Cany anyone suggest the system tables that can be used for this requirement.

Difference between SCC1 and SCC1N? Functions and use case.
Hello https://people.sap.com/whydoineedaname,
In comparison to the Client Copy Tool SCC1N supports Table Change Log (DBTABLOG).
SCC1N provides an Insert-Only-Mode which ensures that existing customizing is not deleted but only updated.
SCC1N uses a Delta-Data-Copy-Algorithm comparing two clients and updating only deleted or changed records. For more details refer below SAP Blog.

I can't find a way to make numbers in free hand SQL be dimensions rather than measures. I have numbers that are unique ID fields and primary or foreign keys. WebI is trying to aggregate them, causing a #multivalue error. Defaulting numbers to measures is a really stupid default if it can't be changed.
These fields are dimensions in my universes.
I know that I can make a variable and assign it as a dimension, but I need to be able to join/relate them to other objects where the data type is numeric.
DWIGHT BIRDUnfortunately, I don't think there is a way to do this in free hand SQL. You may need to create a variable for each field in WebI, and then assign it as a dimension. This will allow you to join/relate it to other objects that have a numeric data type.
I have started cloning this GitHub repo for multitenancy in SAP BTP Cloud Foundry. I started with the Get Started > BUILD
As mentioned I have followed the steps to change the "xsappname" and "appName" in the saas-registry service definition section and xs-security.json file. I had to change the job-scheduler service plan from "standard" to "lite" since I was using a trial account.
Then I successfully built the project and deployed it to my BTP account. When I try to subscribe to the deployed "Easy Franchise" application from Service Marketplace it throws the below error.

Any idea what I might be doing wrong here? I'm trying to make this application work to just see how multitenancy works in BTP.
My end goal is to just create a Multitenancy application package for BTP with a freestyle UI5 application and a HANA database service for backend data storage. Any other ways which can guide me to do the same might also be helpful.
Hi All,
The data mapper is taking too long to convert the data to DTO and give the response back. This is happening only the first time an API is called, and then it responds very quickly.
Let me know if anyone has faced the same. 
Are you sure the issue is at mapper level? What if you open Dynatrace -> distributed traces and verify every step behind that call? Perhaps there is another bottleneck.
If the issue is at datamapper level, try to optimize the data mapping process to make it more efficient, for example by reducing the amount of data being processed. For instance, map only the values you need (by means of "fields" query param) instead of fields=FULL Tip: Try to manually call the API (with curl or another client) and test each single field; verify if you always see the latency or just for specific values.Check also your populators (Model -> Data), are they fast as expected?

Hello everyone.
I needed to find out if there was a way to see the unlocks/locks that occurred to users on the system.
The SUIM Users establishes the modification for me, but I was looking for another table that also indicates it.
I tried with the USH02 but it shows the record of the change but not what specific change was made, and also using the CDHDR and CDPOS but these do not show me the modifications that I want.
So my question is to know if there is any other table that can be used to see this type of change.
Greetings.
Hi,
You can play around with USR02. I have my backend SQL Server - so this is the kind of query I normally use to get the necessary data. My requirement is only for the SYSTEM Account.
SELECT  [MANDT]
      ,[BNAME]
      ,[UFLAG]
	  ,[USTYP]
      ,[TRDAT]
	  ,[PWDCHGDATE]
       FROM [YYY].[yyy].[USR02]
--where BNAME not like '%[0-9]%'
--where TRDAT<20230223 
where UFLAG=0
and [USTYP] NOT IN ( 'A')
order by [PWDCHGDATE] desc

Hi Team, i have built 10 level Hierarchy based on our lvl 5 template.
 bit struggling in one formula where i have two manager level 1 instead of just 1 (150 Emp )
let me know if i can share the calculated formula what might need to be altered.
thanks in adavance 
Is there a way to identify which one is the correct manager based on the data? It may then be as simple as getting in an extra calculated column to put a flag on the value to keep or remove and then filter on that, but as we have no view on the formula, how you've built up your query and how the org structure looks, it's a bit hard to provide better feedback.
Dear SAP,
We use ABAP daemon for processing a huge amount of data and indeed can run for a couple of hours. It is a very heavy workload.
In the daemon, we call the function module BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_CHECK for checking invoices before they get booked.
Inside the BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_CHECK a functional module FI_COBL_CHECK gets called which can throw MESSAGE of type E as follows:
 CASE SUBRC. WHEN 0. WHEN 1. MESSAGE E165 WITH I_COBL-BUKRS RAISING COMPANY_CODE. WHEN 2. MESSAGE E162 WITH I_COBL-GSBER RAISING BUISNESS_AREA. WHEN 3. MESSAGE E505 WITH T001-KTOPL T001-BUKRS RAISING CHART_OF_ACCOUNT. WHEN 4. MESSAGE E507 WITH HKONT T001-KTOPL RAISING GL_ACCOUNT_A. WHEN 5. MESSAGE E506 WITH HKONT I_COBL-BUKRS RAISING GL_ACCOUNT_B. WHEN 6. MESSAGE E210 WITH I_COBL-BUKRS I_COBL-WAERS RAISING CURRENCY. WHEN 7. MESSAGE E508 WITH I_COBL-ANLN1 I_COBL-ANLN2 I_COBL-BUKRS RAISING ASSET. WHEN 8. MESSAGE E562 WITH HKONT I_COBL-BUKRS.  WHEN 9. MESSAGE E262(GZ) WITH I_COBL-RMVCT. WHEN 10. MESSAGE E098(GM) WITH I_COBL-FKBER. WHEN 11. MESSAGE E162 WITH I_COBL-PARGB RAISING BUISNESS_AREA. WHEN 12. "note 1744468 MESSAGE E351 WITH HKONT I_COBL-BUKRS. "note 1744468  WHEN OTHERS.
According to the ABAP Daemons Programming Model documentation on
https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/753088fc00704d0a80e7fbd6803c8adb/3d31e40f220d4904ad3a54fd775022d4.html?version=201809.001
when an error occurs of type E/A/X message during the execution then the hook ON_ERROR will get called, and function module execution will be aborted immediately.
For us, it is important to get all the messages back from function module BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_CHECK which it is provided as a table parameter: 
RETURN LIKE BAPIRET2 Return Parameter
for showing users what went wrong that they can take reaction.
The question is how to prevent the termination of the function module execution when a message of type E/A/X occurs inside the function module.

The error is about the classic exception ACCOUNT raised by FI_GL_ACCOUNT_DATA which is not handled by SUBST_SINGLE_HKONT in SAPLFACI:

As you said, FI_GL_ACCOUNT_DATA is raising the exception ACCOUNT:

The only solution is to add "EXCEPTIONS account = 1" (or OTHERS = 1) in SUBST_SINGLE_HKONT.
If you don't do it, it will end in an exception in the Daemon.
That's an abnormal situation that FI_GL_ACCOUNT_DATA exception is not caught so I think that you may contact the SAP support.
NB: you can't handle the error with ERROR_MESSAGE because the MESSAGE statement has the RAISING word. 
In my current project the business want to send CO data from MDG Prod into S/4DEV for testing (once MDG CR is approved).Currently after the testing is done the MDG Team say the only way to get the data to S/4PROD is via a manual DRFOUT replication trigger.I have proposed that an additional workflow step is added to the change request to confirm the successful test in S/4DEV and this triggers the release of the data object into S/4PROD.
I am not an expert in MDG but believe this should be possible so I hope one of the MDG Experts in this forum can offer some advice so I can avoid any manual replication tasks.
What is CO data?
And do you want to send from Prod to Dev or opposite (you mix it - anyway it does not matter)
If DRF is correctly set-up you don't need to trigger the replication manually (in older versions however some note is needed)

The system is the latest S/4HANA and S/4HANA MDG release and the objects are Finance/Controlling e.g. Profit Center, Cost Center, WBS Elements etc.
The requirement is for the first approval of the change request to send the data to DEV (automatically) and then it will be tested in DEV and when it is approved it needs to go to production. My suggestion is to add an additional workflow step (and status) and this extra step releases the data to PROD. 
Standard workflow would only distribute the data to ONE system so additional workflow steps and statuses are required but so far the MDG Team are saying what I suggest is not possible, but I believe it is with additional development.

Hello Otto, 
HANA Studio is not very effective for editing SDI remote sources. Not sure if there is a Database Explorer app in your HANA Express, that would be a better UI for this purpose. In HANA Studio there can be misinterpreted configuration; and all unnecessary credential options are displayed even though only one is really used. You will have to use Technical User for the credentials instead of None, and enter the AccessToken in each mandatory credential field.
Not sure if you have already set up an AccessToken & root dirs for FileAdapter on your agent. Do those first, then fill out all of the credential/password entries HANA Studio is asking you for with the same AccessToken you created.
Best regards,Jeff
Thanks for the answer - will try that with accesstoken*************************
I have a problem with the "Database Explorer app"
SQL Console could not connect to the database.
Error: There was a problem making a connection to the database (ID C44_0): SQL_ERROR
SQL Error: Connection failed (RTE:[89006] System call 'recv' failed, rc=104:Connection reset by peer {10.3.0.4:62398 -> 10.3.0.4:39015} (10.3.0.4:62398 -> zhanatrial.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com:39015))

Connecting from hana studio works using the same hostname and port
I have been able to create a database table and do insert, update and delete from the sql console in hana studio so something is working.
Next steps :
_
Replicate "Change Data Capture" (CDC) from HANA table to the below destinations
_
Write to File on local file system
_
Write to HDFS file system
_
Write to Hive

Update to Hive
_
Delete from Hive

When doing a Publication in BI 4.3 SP2 I have a dynamic file name like so
"%Ref ID - VALUE% - %Title - VALUE% - %Company Name - VALUE%".%EXT%
Publication runs correctly but ALL the resulting file names appear with a x22 at the start and end of the file names as below?
x22ID - Title - Companyx22
Any idea the cause of this issue?
the placeholder that are allowed are:  
%SI_ID%  %SI_NAME%.  %EXT% %SI_OWNER% %SI_STARTTIME% %SI_OWNER%  %SI_DATE%
...
x22 comes from the space you use in the filename
Can you explain further on what you meant with x22 comes from the space you use in the filename. Not sure I understand this part
Hello Community,
does anyone know or experienced best way to manage business partner sales block (specifically sales order block) on SAP CPQ (Quote 2.0)?
Does anyone know if this feature is on the SAP CPQ roadmap for next releases? I'm not able to find any reference on existing documentation.
My idea is to rely on custom fields and then use a global script that somehow blocks the possibility of adding the customer or signals to users that the customer is blocked.
Best regards,
Davide 
Hi Davide,
I believe there is an influence request for this - have a look: CPQ Influence Once it has 15 votes, SAP can look into placing it on the roadmap.
Best,
Patrick
Hi Patrick,
had a look at sap cpq influence portal. I'm not able to find the specific request among open request.
Do you think I should open a new one?

Hello,
I failed to find any info on the topic on how the app F0842A Manage Purchase Orders - defaults CCode and Purchasing Ogranisation.
When I enter Supplier which is extended to two different company codes and two different purchasing organization (1610 and 1000) the app automatically picks the wrong Company code 1610 and wrong purchasing group, while keeping Purchasing Org field blank. 
User defaults are empty, user parameters are not maintained. Seems like kind of magic...
Any ideas?

SAP BTP SDK for Android 6.0.0 and 5.1.0: Service call (Create) terminates on the native client, but the backend response in the SAP Gateway runs through properly. 
Exception:
com.sap.cloud.mobile.odata.http.HttpException: https://....;
Caused by: com.sap.cloud.mobile.odata.core.RuntimeIOException;
Caused by: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: timeout
The problem only occurs above a certain response size, below that the call works. Tested with SDK versions 5.1.0 and 6.0.0. It is not caused by the settings for timeout and max. request size of the Mobile Connections in BTP/Mobile Services. Could not find any hint in the network trace.
How to manage this buggy behaviour?
You could try this: In the SAP Mobile Services Cockpit, in the Connectivity configuration for the mobile app's destination, change the Rewrite Mode to "No Rewriting".
(Since you are using the OData APIs in the client SDK, which "relativise" all received URLs and shouldn't need the rewriting).
In more recent times, disabling rewriting has allowed the Mobile Services to "stream" the response back and not be size-limited for the response size.
If that doesn't help, please open a support incident.
Is there another "proxy" between the SAP Mobile Services and the backend Gateway system, including Cloud Connector or SAP Web Dispatcher (or other)?
Perhaps there is a payload size limitation being applied in such a proxy.
Solved the issue by increasing the timeout value for OkHttpClient. See class doc in com.squareup.okhttp3.okhttp.OkHttpClient.kt. The HttpClient can be configured after it has been created by the Flow. The client should be used for all http calls, which will be done by ClientProvider.set().
Dear Experts,
I have performed GSTR1, 2 & 3B for one of our clients. In GSTR-1 my total tax reported is INR.7,051,248.18. For GSTR2 total tax reported is INR. 6,540,501.64 where I have set invoice one of the invoices with Tax Amount 90000 as rejected. Now when I perform GSTR3B the expected net liability should be as follows: 
GSTR1 A 7,051,248.18 
GSTR2 B 6,540,501.64 
Payable C 510,746.54 (A-B) 
Rejected D 90,000.00 
Net Payable E 600,746.54 (C+D) 
However, the GSTR 3B return in ByD shows the payable amount as INR. 510746.54 which is also taking into account the Input GST of INR. 90000. 
Kindly assist.

Dear all,
According to SAP Help Portal, it is possible to manually assign the status Done to an SFC. See: SFC Statuses | SAP Help Portal
However, I cannot find any APP or API in SAP DMC to do so.
Could you please explain how to manually set the status of an SFC to Done?
Thanks,Manuel
Hello Manuel,
I am sorry, but this is an error in the documentation and it will be corrected.
Currently it is not supported to manually set a SFC to Done.
If this is required for your production process, then please involve your direct SAP contact for DMC.
Best regards, Michael
Hi Manuel,
if you need a work around to set a SFC to done, you could use a special routing:

Hi All SAP Integration & Basis Experts,
I have a question regarding SAP PO 7.5 SP19 PL20 - we have a new MQ system in the landscape and trying to connect to MQ with the above SAP PO with JMS adapter. We are getting multiple level of errors from JMS adapter.
We have installed all the needed Certificates in SAP PO and we are ending up with errors - related to CIPHER.
We have JMS2.0 enabled and adapter basis component version is 7.5 
We are provided with set of CIPHER's provided by IBM and we tried them - all of them ended up with errors.
Before updating the PO system with latest JMS20 libs - this is the error :
A channel error occurred. Detailed error (if any) : com.sap.aii.adapter.jms.api.connector.ConnectorException: Library with name com.sap.aii.adapter.lib.jms20 not found.<br> 
Basis teams have updated the libraries and we are getting errors related to CIPHER's - we tried all the CIPHERs that IBM documentation has provided and we are getting the below error : 
Using TCP / IP at adapter : we are getting CIPHER issues.
Error creating JMS connection. The JMS provider gave the error message as JMSWMQ0018: Failed to connect to queue manager 'OM_QMGR' with connection mode 'Client' and host name 'null'. JMSCMQ0001: IBM MQ call failed with compcode '2' ('MQCC_FAILED') reason '2400' ('MQRC_UNSUPPORTED_CIPHER_SUITE')., and the error code as JMSWMQ0018.
Using Websphere MQ protocol at adapter :

Did anyone worked on the JMS2.0 Adapter with IBM MQ latest version connectivity and got these kind of errors?

We have a certification that expires on November 30th of the year after a course was completed, so we have set curricula the following parameters for retraining:
Retraining Number = 1Retraining Period = YearsRetraining Basis = Calendar
Basis Date = 12/1/2017 [Note: I don't think the year matters in this case]
Effective Date = 12/1/2017
Currently with the parameters above, if the course is completed between Dec 1 2021 and Nov 30 2022, the curricula expires on Nov 30 2023. If the course is completed between Dec 1 2022 and Nov 30 2023, the curricula expires on Nov 30 2024, and so on.
We would like to make it so that if the course is completed between Jan 1 2022 and Dec 31 2022, the curricula expires on Nov 30 2023. If the course is completed between Jan 1 2023 and Dec 31 2023, the curricula expires on Nov 30 2024, and so on.
Is there any way I can set the retraining parameters for curricula so that the course completion interval is not the same as the curricula expiry interval? Thanks in advance!
Hi Expert,
I am having an issue with default back button, as onActivityBack pressed is not triggered by default back button , I want to hide it from the screen.
I defined my navigation as Modal but still it is appearing.
I am using MDK version 6.3.3 and Android device.
 Bill Froelich any help would be much appreciated.
Thanks,
Ram
The MDK application has a main navigation stack that starts with the Main Page of your application.  Subsequent navigation actions will add the new page to that main stack.  If you have a navigation that navigates to a modal page then the client starts a modal stack.  This modal stack is a new navigation stack that "sits" on top of the current page that was displayed when the navigation was called.  Once on the modal stack and navigation action (modal or normal) will be added to the existing modal stack until the modal is dismissed.  You cannot start a second modal stack if there is already a modal stack open.  So in your example the back button you want to hide will appear because you are in a modal stack already.
The navigation action includes a property "ClearHistory" that when set to true will navigate to the specified page and clear the current nav stack so that the specified page is now the start of the stack.  So in your Modal example when navigating to the Second Modal page where you don't want the back button if you set ClearHistory to true it would not have the back button but that also means the the original Modal Pag and subsequent Normal page would be removed.
In a future release we are also working on adding an event that will trigger when the back button is pressed to give the developer control to display messaging for example about canceling the current page and even prevent the back from occurring if needed.  I will not allow for the button to be removed but at least give you control of the event. 
Hi Bill,
Please find the screenshot, and this is the action I used to navigate to this screen.

 Bill Froelich Yes but I am opening this page as Modal Page only. I have added logic in onActivityBackPressed event to close the page.
One more question, Can I open a Modal page from another Modal Page?
I have a page navigation like this.
Modal Page(no back button) -> Normal Page -> Modal Page (back button is appearing - I want to hide) 
Thanks,
Ram
Hello Gurus,

I have an issue while doing Payment Run for Customers, We have a customer from country "SM" whereas the bank details and payment method have been maintained for Country "IT" in FBZP and Customer Master.

Now, when are trying to doing APP for Customers it gives message FZ311 - Cust/Vendor bank details not maintained correctly.

So our user is changing the Customer record everytime to IT. Now he wants to use the payment method which is only created in Italy for payments to customers who are from country "SM"San Marino.

Please let me know where I missed the configuration.

Dear Santosh,

In reference to this error FZ651 could you please check yourconfiguration in T-cd:FBZP -> " Payment methods/country"? Is theindicator/field 'Bank details' (T042Z-XBKKT) enabled? If yes, can youplease check if the customer master data has the bank informationmaintained?Moreover please check whether field "Part. Bank Type" is filled ininvoice. You need to compare it with customer master data setting for bankdetails concerning Part. Bank Type.
I hope this helps.

Between CL_ABAP_CLASSDESCR and IF_XCO_AO_CLASS, almost all details of a class is known. As of release 2302, we also have the ability to get all classes that implement an interface via IF_XCO_AO_INTERFACE.
However, I'm missing how we can get to the list of classes that use a particular superclass. The only way I know, using CL_OO_CLASS->GET_SUBCLASSES(), is not released for use. Is there another way?
Hi Matt,
we have this functionality in our backlog, but unfortunately I can't give you a concrete release date yet. But rest assured, our goal is to make it available soon as it should nicely complement the newly available XCO functionality that allows to retrieve the implementations of an interface (as you already pointed out).
I will update my answer once a more concrete statement with regards to the availability of the feature can be made.
Best regards,

Thanks,
I just downloaded desktop agent 3.12.41 to upgrade from current desktop agent 3.9.47. After the successfull instalation, it ask for update back to 3.9.47. As there is pop up that blocks everything else and I can only choose "Update Now" or "Update Tonight" there is no way of avoiding older version. Same behaviour with version 3.11.50
 I also tried to completely uninstall it, reboot the computer and install again. Did not help.
I'm not having this problem, with version 3.12.45 (which was upgraded this morning).Did you try to run the 3.12 installer itself?
Hi Jaroslav,
This is a normal behavior, new Agent 3 has an automatic upgrade mechanism, to ensure all Agents connected to a tenant have the same version. The reference version to install is defined on the tenant side by the tenant mananger. As soon as an agent is connected to a tenant, it will upgrade to this reference version.
Best regards

Hi Christophe. But it was possible earlier to have different versions of desktop agents on different computers. How am I suppose to test newer version (on lets say test computer) before checking that everything is ok when it immediately is updated back to older version. I also dont understand term of reference version. I have 4 agents on 4 different computers. Which on is reference one? Thank you.
Hello all, 
We had originally confirgured items with 1-year retraining in a curriculum - retraining is no longer needed. 
Seems like I can't choose 0 as valid number of days for retraining (minimum is 1 day) and if I change the single items and unselect retraining, the items still show as Retraining "Yes" in the curricula Content section. 
Is it possible to change this if the curricula had been configured with a 1-year retraining requirement? 
Also, how can you stop users from getting notification reminders to retrain?
Thank you!
Dear Gwen Di Schiena,
Did you try by excluding those users from the assignment profile? So, if I am not part of the assignment profile anymore, the system will not assign it to me.You can try maybe with the Item Completion option.
Thank you.

Hi All,
I'm trying to set up smart filter bar with smart variant management on my app, saving to the layered repository. 
I am getting below error when I run from FLP Sandbox.
GET http://HOSTNAME:PORTNUMBER/sap/bc/lrep/flex/data/APPNAME.Component 403 (Forbidden)
(Where HOSTNAME and APPNAME are the actual host and app I'm working with).
Due to this in Variant view I am getting an error "Unable to load the data." 
I deployed the application in UI5 ABAP repository and tried running there too , but getting the same error in Variant view. 
"Unable to load the data. This can happen if you are not connected to the Internet, or if an underlying system or component is not available." 
I checked in SICF both the services are active (/SAP/BC/UI5_UI5, /SAP/BC/LREP) and there is no auth issues in SU53.
Could some one suggest and help me to resolve this?

In the debugging , I found that there are 2 calls happening , one for fileType variant and one for fileType change. I am getting result as undefined in fileType change, due to this system is throwing an exception. fileType variant is success. Attaching the payload of both.

Hi,
I have duplicate a trainer style to a customer trainer style.
I have made some modification like colors, logo, etc...
Under Settings->Playback Settings->trainer - Global on the tab Visual Properties I have change the Style to my customer style.
I saved in the manager my modifications.
When I wants to view the result in the Learner view, I have the standard trainer style and I cannot see my result.
What's wrong ?
Regards,
Antoine
Hi  Antoine Picaud, 
Maybe it's worth checking whether the Playback Settings where you changed the parameters are:
1) Published
2) Selected as default (in bold in the Project editor) 

See, in my case I have 3 different Playback settings, but only one is selected as a default, and this one has references to my customizations.
Hope, it helps.
Did you make sure the Playback Settings resource you changed is set as the default, and publish both the Playback Settings and Trainer Style resources? Also make sure Configurations > Default is saved to the server and published. If all of that is OK it may be a caching issue = clear your browser files and try again.
Hi
I have created my playack setting but it's not a bold (not by default). How to set up to the default Playback settings ?
Regards,
Antoine
I have found the solution with the heart.
I resume my change because the result is wrong :
1°) Create a trainer style xxx with adjustement of color logo,...
2°) Publish the trainer style
3°) Copy Playback Setting to Plaback setting xxx
4°) Set as default the Plaback setting xxx
5°) Under Settings->Playback Settings xxx->trainer - Global on the tab Visual Properties I changed the Style to my customer style.
6°) Save to server+Publish the Plaback setting xxx
7°) Clear the cache of my browser
8°) Open the learner view
And I have the default settings.
The result is wrong and I do not understand why.
If you have an idea.

Kindly assist.
PFA is the error screenshot.

Hi Jagannath,
The user under which the Tomcat service is running on the OS needs to have access to the fileserver location.
Kind regards,Martijn van Foeken | Interdobs
Hi Jagan,
The folder path depends on the OS. The route should use Windows format if the agent is operating on a Microsoft web application server. An illustration might be - C:\folder1\folder2 or \\servername\volume\path. 
The path should be in Linux format if the agent is operating on a Linux machine. For instance, /net/abc/.

Hey Experts,
I want to assign my WBS project types to specific project profiles so that the dropdown menu is only showing the correct project types for selecting.
For this I used in SPRO the Change View Assign project types to project profile with no effect.I found the SAP Note 2232730 and 2536982. However it cannot be implemented on my System.

Is there an updated version of the Notes 2232730 and 2536982? (I cannot find them) 

I followed the instructions of SAP Note 2232730 and as far as I can see everything is there as mentioned in the note. The only thing I I don't know to check or implement is the following part.
"For the above feature, activate the below PROF_PTYPE_FLG flag via BADI: PS_FUNCTION_SWITCH method get_switch, by setting value to 'X' " [SAP Note 2232730]
I am able to find the BADI PS_FUNCTION_SWITCH however at the screen shown in the image 5: Display IF_PS_FUNCTION_SWITCH I am running out of knowledge what to do. Help at this point would be great for me.

Am I on the right track to set the PROF_PTYPE_FLG to the value X? 
Or is it a bad idea? Because the Note 2232730 is obviously not for my system.

I also found some question here, however there is only the mentioned Note 2232730. There is never mentioned something when the system is incompatible to the the note because of updates. My system is to "updated" for the note and the Change View Assign project types to project profile still not working.

Hello,
we are currently in the data migration from SAP ECC to SAP S/4 HANA 2021 using staging tables and the "Migrate your data"-Fiori App.
We have downloaded the XML templates of the migration objects. Filling these templates manually (copy & paste) and uploading them to the HANA staging tables works fine.
But I have a question: Are there any programs or tools to fill the XML Excel templates directly from SAP ECC (or from text files)?
I can't believe that there are no such tools. We want to migrate only selected data to our S/4 HANA test system. But we don't want to copy & paste them manually.
I hope you can help me.
Kind regards
Andreas Hofmeister
Hi Andreas,
I believe this question is somewhat similar to this SAP Community question below:
SAP Community Q&A post
You can find the FAQ for using Migration Cockpit with staging table approach, and all the information on how you can fill the XML templates.
However if you would like to avoid working with XML templates, I'd suggest looking into Direct Transfer migration approach, you can find more information about this option below:
SAP Help Documentation - Migrate Data Directly from SAP System (Direct Transfer)
SAP KBA 3249988 - Details on selection process - SAP S/4HANA Migration Cockpit - Direct Transfer
SAP KBA 3056885 - Performance tips & tricks, SAP S/4HANA Migration Cockpit: Transfer data directly from SAP system
I hope this information helps.
Kind regards,
Tamas
Hi Andreas,
did you check the migration approach "Migrate data directly from SAP System"?
With this, you connect to an ECC system via RFC and data is fetched automatically. This is the recommended approach coming from an ECC system.
Check details in SAP S/4HANA migration cockpit overview 2021, slides 76ff.
best regards,

Hi Andreas
You can make your own extraction programs in the ECC system using ABAP and ABAP2XLSX. 
From there you then populate your XML load files. It works very fine for us :-) 
Best Regards, 
Gitte. 
Hi Gitte
Thank you for your answer.
I'm a bit at a loss. Can you explain what ABAP2XLSX is? It isn't a program or transaction, or? I searched in SE38 for this program, but didn't find it.
Maybe you can explain this approach in few words.
Kind regardsAndreas

Hi all,
How do I get missing materials in my report. Following two tables am driving most of the data for reporting. In my Calculation view I am using Month End Date from HPMACT table and materials from BPOBASELINE table. for the month of Jan 2023 some material doesn't exist but these materials exist in BPOBASELINE table. 
Customer is asking even the month end date doesn't exist for some materials they still want them to show in the report.
Not sure how do I do this in calculation view. Any help would be greatly appreciate it.
Thank you,

Hello Experts,
is there a possibility to format the output within a token? 
This is how the notifications look like:

This is the code:
<html>
<font size="2" face="arial">
<label key="notification.u.salutation"/><br><br>
<LOOP>
<label key="notification.Enrollment.MessageText1"/><&ROLLUP_MESG><br>
</LOOP>
<LOOP>
<label key="notification.Enrollment.MessageText2" arg0="<&ROLLUP_STUD_ID>" arg1="<&ROLLUP_STUD_NAME>"/><br><br>
</LOOP>
<label key="notification.Enrollment.MessageText3"/><br>
<&SCHD-DESC><br><br>
<label key="notification.Enrollment.MessageText4"/><br>
<&SEG-GRID><br><br>

<LOOP>
<label key="notification.Enrollment.MessageText6" arg0="<&APPROVAL_OR_DENIAL_REASON>"/><br><br>
</LOOP>
<label key="notification.u.question.contact"/><br>
</html>
Is there a possibility that the text within a token is formated like this (the following example shows the output of the token: <&SEG-GRID>):
Beginn: 25.03.2023 10:00 Europa/Berlin 
Ende: 25.03.2023 18:00 Europa/Berlin 
Kursleiter: xy
Einrichtung: Logistikzentrum 
Primärer Standort: Logistikzentrum
This is the sequence of the code that is shown above in text format:

<label key="notification.Enrollment.MessageText4"/><br>
<&SEG-GRID><br><br>
If yes how am I able to format the text within a token? Thank you very much.
Kind regards,
Celin

Dear Celin Mutschler,
Yes, you can change the format as explained in this KBA.
I hope it helps!
Thank you.

Hey all - with the new CDS 6 release, I am attempting to upgrade my project environment to Node 16 as recommended. I have everything working fine locally but when deploying to cloud foundry I ran into this error when running "npx cds run" to :
npm ERR! could not determine executable to run

npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:
npm ERR!     /Users/matthewreddy/.npm/_logs/2022-07-09T05_14_51_704Z-debug-0.log<br>
I have narrowed down the difference to the presence of @sap/cds-dk v6.0.2 (devDependency) and @sap/cds v6.0.2 (regular dependency) by removing all node modules, fixing my local node to the exact release of Node that the CF nodejs buildpack runs (16.14.2) running a "--production" installation locally (as is done during remote deploy).
Previously, in cds 5.x.x and Node 12 this paradigm worked fine. "npx cds ..." would be recognized as a command supplied by @sap/cds. However, with cds 6.x.x it seems to require @sap/cds-dk to recognize the command.
My question - is this an intentional change? And if so, it seems like we would need both @sap/cds and @sap/cds-dk based on the docs: @sap/cds-dk for the CLI commands and @sap/cds for project usage (i.e. "let cds = require('@sap/cds-dk')". My original impression - from back in the CDS 3 days - was that @sap/cds-dk was meant for local development while the leaner, more direct @sap/cds was intended for production (remote) deployment.
For me it was related to a missing system link, my ./node_modules/bin did not contain a "cds" entry after doing "npm clean-install --production" (or --omit=dev), unless cds-dk was also included as a dependency, even thou sap/cds clearly has a "bin" property in it's package.json.
My workaround was to modify my script to call "npm rebuild" afterwards, then I don't have to include cds-dk into a dependency. Hope it helps someone else.
For the Cf failure: this is hard to tell from the truncated error message above.  But could well be that this failed because of old Node.js 12.   @sap/cds and cds-dk 6 require Node 14 at the minimum (see release notes).
For the dependencies, basically nothing has changed:

Is there an official way to submit a formal product enhancement suggestion?


One of the things I miss about BOE XI R2 is the way the CMC constructed the "User List" display. It created the logical equivalent of "page tabs" across the top of the frame, with each "tab" listing the first user on that tab. It was trivial to find the user I was looking for, by simply selecting the "tab" representing the page that contained that user.

I haven't used XI 3, but I've recently installed XI 4.0, and the equivalent "User List" display under "Users & Groups" isn't nearly as easy to use. When I expand "User List" it says "Too many objects". I was thinking that it would be a very simple enhancement to replace that (useless) message with a set of objects representing the pages of users. Each object listed under "User List" could have an object name of the first userid on the page of users. That would give me functionality equivalent to the R2 "page tabs", and allow me to immediately jump to the exact page containing the userid I'm searching for.

I don't mind submitting this suggestion as an official Product Enhancement Request. But, I'm unable to find a description of the process I should use to do that.

Thanks
Bill
Hi,

you could pase your idea at the "IdeaPlace" on the top right of the SDN Page.

The second way would be transmitting a Message to the SAP Support using the Service Marketplace. In this Message you could request it as Feature in future releases.

Regards
-Seb.
Please post your enhancement request in
https://influence.sap.com/
If you get the required votes, your request will be reviewed and considered for future enhancement
Kindly submit your ideas to the product in the following link :

Hi all,
Members of my team have modified notifications at an item level not knowing that the link to the global model was broken.We have tried different solutions, and hours researching online with no luck. Is there a way to reestablish the link from the item notification to the global model? Or is it just broken for permanently? 
Best regards,
Kevin
Yes!So as stated from SAP help, a link exist between an item to the global (system default) notification template. That link is broken when a modification is made to the model at the item level. There is no information available (or that I can find) on the procedure to relink a modified item to the global (system default) notification template.
See the item help in the link below.
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_SUCCESSFACTORS_LEARNING/5fae31b1299d4033b665edabea7b9087/2c45fef01fd345a5af9077dfc61a38f0.html?locale=null
Hi experts,
users receive the SystemUnenrollmentNotification when

a manager doesn't approve
an admin cancels the registration
a user cancels the registration
a manager cancels the registration


At the moment the user always gets the same text in the notification independent of the reason of unenrollment.
But it makes a difference if the manager didn't approve or an existing registration has been canceld.
At the notification there are different possibilities to chance for persons who receive the notifications.
Does anyone have an idea how we can design the mail depending on the reason for the unenrollment?
Regards
Guido
Dear Guido Klinger,
The SystemUnenrollmentNotification notification template is triggered when a user or administrator withdraws the user from a class, as you can confirm from SAP documentation below. Unfortunately there is no way to have the user who acted in this withdraw, as this is not an available token.As part of the notification we have the cancelation reason, when it is a withdraw and the denial reason, when it is not approved.
Thank you.

Karen Perez

Hi All
I am following below document but while Adding a Destination System , MII is not showing in drop down list. How to add MII as destination system.
Monitoring a Local or Shared Folder for a File using PCo | SAP Blogs

Hi Adnan Maqbool ,
I have not tried but the help document suggested that to use 'universal Web service destination system'. Refer the document in below url
MII Destination System (Deprecated)
Regards,
Aravinth
I've got some probleman trying to notify MII a file content from Pco 15.5 using SOAP webserverdestination.
In event viewer i can see that the transaction is called correctly but seems the FILE CONTENT is "BLANK".
In the transaction i've create an XML input variable (also tried with string) and selected it as inputParameters in Request Message Configuration.
In Pco LOG (verbose mode) i can see this message (ciao is my file content)
In MII trnasaction i've create this EVENT LOGGER "FILE REACHED" & "\n" & Transaction.XML
but in EVENT VIEWER i can see only "FILE REACHED" as the XML input variable has not been passed.
Hi Steve
the transaction (just a Test) is very simple i've got only an event Logger to log the input value from PCO


In Pco i hve created a destination 

and an Agent to notify file content

this is the notification

in the PCO Log i can see that notification is being send correctly 

but in MII LOG i cannot see the file content

if i switch to MII destination (deprecated) all it's fine and i receive the file from PCo
Hi steve
i confirm that solve the problem! Thank'you very much for your help
When you come in Italy you have a payed Beer from me! 
Hi @Adnan Maqbool,
You can change the compatibility settings in Plant Connectivity Management Console by choosing the menu entry (Tools>Options>Global Settings>Compatibility) and checking "Allow Creation of Deprecated Configuration Elements". Now you will be able to create the source and destination systems that are flagged as deprecated:

Dear community,
Currently Launchpad service feature "Spaces and Pages" is limited to use with S4 on premise systems.
Is our assumption correct that the following roadmap/beta feature will also make it possible to built pages and add content from older ERP on premise systems?
"Ability to create and administrate spaces and pages (beta feature)"https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=73554900100800003081⦥=CURRENT-LAST#Q1%202023 
Thanks and RegardsPhilip
Hi Philip, 
yes, your assumption is right. This feature will allow customers to create pages on SAP Build Work Zone, standard edition and add applications coming from content channels or manually created apps. For supported products and platforms, see the documentation. In Q1, it is planned to be made available to selected customers as part of the beta program. General availability is planned for later this year.
Regards,Sibylle
Hello Philip,
your link is not working for me. 
Are you talking about the on-Premise launchpad integrated into S/4HANA or the Fiori Frontend Server? Or are you talking about the Launchpad Service in the BTP that is called SAP Build Workzone (Standard Edition) now? 
Best regards,Markus
Hello Markus,
the latter! Here's the correct link: https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=73554900100800003081⦥=FIRST-LAST

Thanks Sibylle for your helpful answer, this is good news. We applied for this Beta already in December. When can we expect a reply from SAP?Regards,Philip
Hi over there.
I've created, via Eclipse ADT, a CDS extension view for the standard CDS C_SALESORDERITEMFS. I've put two associations; I've used individual fields in the selection list from one of those associations, and I've added the second association directly in the selection list. As below:

Well then, the C_SALESORDERITEMFS standard CDS View is exposed as an EntitySet of the standard OData service SD_F1814_SO_FS_SRV. And while the individual fields from _ZV01 association that I've added are visible in each individual record from C_SALESORDERITEMFS EntitySet...

...the _zv01Tabla association is not, and is neither on the Metadata of the OData (in the first screenshot the new association should appear after the to_TransactionCurrency one):


However, if I run the C_SALESORDERITEMFS View in Eclipse and use the Follow Association Command, I can see the original standard association as well as the new one added by me:

Why is this happening? Is it possible to expose/use the association as itself in the standard CDS OData?
Hi,
I had the same question before.
I could solve the issue by exposing the association target (in your case zv01) in the Service Definition. OData will only expose the association in its metadata, if the target is also exposed. Otherwise, the target cannot be accessed and thus the association would be useless. Consequently, the association is not shown in OData.
In your case, zv01 seems to be a table, but tables cannot be exposed in Service Definitions. So you would need to introduce a Data Definition as a layer between the database table and the Service Definition. Additionally, it seems you are working with an SAP Service Definition. Consequently, you would need to extend the service:
https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-abap-restful-application-programming-model/including-extension-node-in-service-exposure
Alternatively, if you just want to expose one simple field (without exposing an entity), try to include the field explicitly. In your case  _zv01.posnr as YourAliasForThisField
This should directly include the field via OData with no need to modify (extend) the Service Definition.
All in all, it depends on your requirement. If you really need to full association for navigation in OData, you will need to include the target in the Service Definition. Otherwise, you may try to include individual fields directly.
I hope I could help you with this suggestion.
Best,Nikolas
Hi Experts, 
The returnable transport items which consists of returnable load carriers like pallets and rolling materials and returnable secondary packaging like totes, plastic crates have typically GRAI ( Global returnable asset identifier ) code assigned to them as per GS1 standards. 
I have a requirement where SAP TM should track such transport items mentioned above , which will have GRAI codes assigned to the same..Can any expert suggest how to implement the standard TM solution for GRAI Codes? I was not able to find any standard field in TM for GRAI codes when I looked at Define Resource FIORI ...
If there are some insights on using GRAI codes in SAP TM , then please let me know.. We would eventually use GRAI codes for scanning via RFID scans..
Thanks

I wanted to understand the settings in S4 for IDoc HRMD_A09.HRMD_A_CFS by using program RHALENI to replicate employees.

BYD标准功能中销售目标计划只能和销售订单总金额或者销售订单开票金额对比,都是基于订单创建日期的。这就会存在2022年创建的订单在2023年才出库的部门，订单已开票金额即不在22年统计中也不在23年统计中。科学的销售业绩确认应该是发货后财务过账确认的主营业务收入。如何实现销售目标计划和主营业务收入的对比呢? 我们尝试了组建报表，但因为数据源不一致而无法组合。财务权限下可以把预算和收入做对比，但权限只能在财务内部无法分享给销售部门。两条路都堵死了，销售部门如何清楚地知道销售目标计划和实际收入呢? 希望遇到相关问题的人分享您的建议
Hi,
After an overnight CIF, certain fields are reverting back to blank. I’ve tried troubleshooting through ECC linkage but to no avail. Any ideas why these fields get removed after overnight CIF?
Hi Ronan,
if you do not protect such fields in APO from getting filled/updated from the CIF connected ERP system they will be overwritten with either a delta change at the material in ERP or with an initial CIF transfer (in case you use something like this). This is SAP standard as it comes - ERP material master is the lead unless you use implement an ERP outbound or APO inbound BADI to avoid overwriting material master fields you maintain in APO directly.
Regards
Thomas
Hi Ronan,
which specific field(s) are you refering to ? Is it a field in a master data object (material master) or a specific transactional document (Purchase Order, Sales Order etc.) being CIFed into APO ?
Regards
yes, that’s what I’m thinking, being put down to a change in the system which is why it seems to be a new issue 
thank you Thomas
Hello,
I'm stuck on a strange problem after a system copy, when i launch the su01, the toolbar associated with the transaction won't load (the toolbar with edit, display, lock/unlock, reset password,...). SU10 have the same problem. 
I don't have the problem on others transactions or haven't noticed it. I'ts very annoying to not be able to modify accounts.
I'm currently using the SAP* account, so i don't thing it's a role problem.
Have you already seen a issue like this ?

Hi everybody,
how to create the correct deep link for creating a mdf object record/link to create object record in manage data?
the URL is e.g.:
https://SFInstanceLink/xi/ui/genericobject/pages/mdf/mdf.xhtml?&_s.crb=0dnTX6HiUAN8aAzkM2BdI7ItluXzeWpZeXxKdExQkKg%3d#t=BusinessUnit&n=1
it works, but is this really the correct way or could this cause problems?
Thanks
Dear Bianca Kühnel,
This link will work for all users that have Manage Data + the object permission, so should not be a problem. If the custom MDF is user based and available in the profile, there are other ways of creating the deep links. You can see some examples here.
Thank you.
Best Regards,
Karen Perez
We have done the synchronization for all vendor/customer to BP. In ECC we have some customer /vendor with some contact persons. But we dont use this functionality anymore, and we dont want them to migrate as BPs or linked to the new created Bps.At program CVI_COMPLETENESS_CHECK there is a check where says that still we have contacts person not linked to BPs.Is it a must to migrate/link them ? or we can convert to S4 without any further synchronization of these contact persons?------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
The sync of the contact person is required, if the table KNVK contains values. After the synchronization the table CVI_CUST_CT_LINK and the table CVI_VEND_CT_LINK will contains the link between the contact person and customer/vendor and the BP. 
If you do not need the contact person anymore, you need to delete the contact persons manually and or with using CMD_EI_API-MAINTAIN_BAPI and VMD_EI_API-MAINTAIN_BAPI. Before you are trying to the delete the vendor/customer contact persons with using VMD_EI_API/CMD_EI_API, please read the KBA 2756461 - Deletion of Vendor Contacts not working using VMD_EI_BAPI => MAINTAIN_BAPI- which prerequisites are needed. 
We're not able to see any values in the journal table reflecting the "modified by" user name, but there is a "datemodified". The only user name fields appear to be "UserC" (user created?) and "UserP (user posted/unposted). 
Is there a modified by user name, e.g, UserM? If not, why, and why does it also not appear to be in audit? Seems shocking to save a modified by date without the who component so hoping this is a bug and not by design. Basically, it appears there's no way to ever know "who" modified a journal---not in journal data OR audit data. We can basically report when it changed but by whom, which is a substantial miss so hoping this isn't the design.

Hi All,
One of our customer experienced a wired behaviour and took the screenshot strait away. In one of the employee's jobinformation section under Manager/Supervisor, the Manager Name replaced with some random person name who doesn't even exit in any of the customer instances. Surprisingly, the photo still shows the correct Manager photo.
(change audit log and history doesn't show any change)
The issue disappeared after a while. There is a ticket raised to support, would be good to know your experience.
Many thanks
Satya
Hi Satya Vipperla,
Could you check In the UDF how the manager shows up if is correc or not? 
Hi Leandro,
The correct manager exists in UDF. Also, the correct Higher level position assigned in Position Managment.
Many thanks
Satya
We realize the need to establish an OIDC compliant/capable IAS that connects to our Corporate IDP. The Corporate IDP is OIDC capable.
We followed steps to in this blog: Connecting SAP IAS as a proxy to Azure AD using OpenID Connect | SAP BlogsIn BTP, I stood up a SAP build sub-account and instances, using the booster, against this IAS setup.When going to the instance, I'm getting a consistent:
error as in the attached file
Grateful for your thoughts guidance.Best Regards, Wallace2023-02-21-11-59-52.jpg
Thanks, in the end, this was a simple mistake - ticking the IDP SSO box on the IAS config and then ensuring the "callback" link was proper on Azure AD side.
Grateful to Carsten Olt for the blog, quick response and to Stefan Ressing for the help/guidance.This is now working and will enable more BTP easier, as OIDC seems to become the de facto standard with BTP and some BTP services are requiring OIDC.
Wallace
Hello Wallace,
I tried to understand your question and the screenshot provided.
It seems (assuming) as if the user was trying to access a BTP subaccount using an IdP-Initiated URL (specifying the SP/RelayState as a URL parameter). The goal was probably to forward this request to the corporate IdP. However, SAP IAS rejects this because IdP-Initiated SSO is not permitted for this application. Setting in the application (Trust all Corporate Identity Providers) - thats my guess?
It is also important to note that currently (as far as I know) only Azure Active Directory is officially supported by SAP as an OIDC Identity Provider.
Does that help?
Cheers Carsten
Dear Experts,
Could someone kindly let me know the difference between decoupled lead time calculation in Buffer Positioning app and Schedule Lead Time Classification app. 
Also please let me know how the lead time factors are calculated in DDMRP for S4 Hana.
Thanks,
Amal Sam Abraham
Hello
Decouple lead-time calculation will be used to calculate the decupled lead-time, that means, the lead-time between your product and the next buffered product. 
Schedule lead time classification will be used to determine if the calculated lead-time is short, medium or long. According to this classification, DDMRP will choose which buffer profile should be used for your product.

Hi, 
i would like to know the use of the individual lead time calculation in the mass change (DDMRP) 
and the difference between ( HCRE : historical calculation starting from creation date and HREL : from posting date .... 
capture.jpg
Hello,
Unfortunally, SAP does not give us a lot of details regarding your request.
SPRO provides the follow explanation:
Use
You can choose the method used to calculate the individual lead time for your products when using demand-driven replenishment.
Here, you can choose between historic average based lead times and predicted lead times.
Lead time can be calculated based on its historic average, and this is the default method of calculation.
Lead time, when predicted, is calculated using machine learning, and will grow more accurate over time. Note that in the initial stages you might see a mismatch in the predictions when compared to the actual lead times.
And objects HCRE, MM, HREL are without details:

What is the best way, in a process map, to represent a point where you have to leave the current process to complete a new one before moving onto the next step? And how do you represent where you come back into the initial process? Could it be throwing and catching?
Hi Danielle, Using throwing and catching intermediate events is a good way to represent the scenario that you are referring to.
Throwing intermediate events can be used interchangeably with End events to represent a transfer of the token from one process to another. Similarly, Catching intermediate events can be used interchangeably with Start events to represent when a previous process is kickstarting the existing one.
Hope this helps.

Hi Team,
I need a support on DDMRP in S/4 HANA. in the below case, depReq not considered for the Planning and also sometimes, BOM exp was not happening for the DDMRP material (Means DepReq not getting passed to DDMRP Material!). 

Hello, 
Please check which MRP Type you are using D1 or D2, based on that you can find out how DepReq affect on your planning.
Sincerely,

Is there a way to allow users to plan data in an SAC planning model, but restrict their modeler capabilities. I do NOT want users to be able to delete fact data using the modeler even if they have access to the data. The deletion of facts requires the maintain feature on the planning model to be enabled, however, when we disable this feature, the users can no longer plan data in that model using stories.
Is there a way around this?
Thank you!

Hi!
I have the use case that I want to modify an importing parameter of a standard method.
I created in Enhancement Mode an overwrite method, where I move the importing parameter to a local structure, change the relevant field and then call me->core_object->method.
But there is an ugly recursion. 
Is there a chance to call the original method directly skipping the replacement?
I would call it an endless failing recursion rather than just "ugly".
You can use an implicit source code enhancement at the beginning of the method instead of an overwrite method.
You need to define an attribute CALLED_BY_MYSELF in the class which has the initial value abap_false.
There will be a 2-times recursive call, which I would find the words "ugly recursion" better suited ;-) so I would of course try to find another solution if possible.
Our company will be rolling out ESS/MSS to our employees. We have activated SAML2 so when a user accesses the Fiori Launchpad, the user will be logging in with their Google account. We would like to avoid having new users be prompted for the first time accessing FLP to change their SAP password since they won't need their SAP password. 
We are using BAPI_USER_CREATE1 to create the SAP users.

Hi,
I have a CAP app deployed to BTP with some scopes. The UI5 apps are deployed to SAP Launchpad service and this works all well. The app also contains an API endpoint that needs to be exposed to the third party. The caller should be limited to just one scope so they can call just this one API endpoint. The caller also does not have an account in BTP. How can this be done securely? 
My assumption is that I should somehow generate a service key with the limited scope and then share it with the external party. The external party will then use it to fetch the token first and then pass it to the actual API endpoint. There seems to be a lot of blogs in this area but it's confusing to me and I am not sure that they are covering my exact scenario. 
Thanks

You can check Allow API Access in my bookshop-demo app. This is based on the blogpost: How to call protected app from external app as external user with scope from  Carlos Roggan.But I would suggest you check his new blogposts that show how to realize client credential authentication with mTLS and IAS.
Please also check the option that  Pieter Janssens described in: Managing technical users for BTP platform access

Is there an option/parameter to limit the number of http plugin sessions by a single user in the system and all application servers?------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
Hello,
Unfortunately, there is no way to limit the number of HTTP sessions from a single user.
On this SAP Wiki page there is a similar clarification from the BC-MID-ICF perspective:
You would need to check what is this user running (that is, which application) that is opening a lot of HTTP sessions, and then involve the application team responsible for them to check from application end if there is any possible configuration to limit this.

Hi everyone,
I wrote some quantity calculation formulas in Account dimension and when I display results in table, on the row level formulas work fine, but I don't want them to be applied on the Total level. 
Picture below is formula for QuantityRef:

Picture below is formula for QuantitySim:

As you can see in the picture below, when MarketGrowth total runs through formula with QuantityRef total, I get huge QuantitySim amount. Instead, I want my formulas to be applied only on the row level and not on total level. 
Is that possible?

My goal here is to compose value driver tree based on these measures, as you can see in the picture below, right now these amounts are huge because of the multiplying on the total level. 

BR,
Marija
Marija Milutinovic
SAC first attempts to aggregate the data as much as possible, and then processes any calculations. So The calculation parent level, the order is that aggregation happens first and then the calculation, hence you see the large results. You can change this behavior by making the calculation first and then the aggregation at parent node by assigning exception aggregation of SUM to both these calculated accounts. Assign the exception aggregation dimensions as one in the row o your report and also other for which you want the calculation to get aggregated by or just select all dimensions.

Hope this helps !!

Dear experts,
Looking for the feasibility wherein HANA database does not turn online upon the completion of database recovery, enabling to apply subsequent logs later.
Problem Statement: 
Performing a system copy i.e. across data centers for a very large database, along with target HANA DB upgrade with backup-restore method. 
Due to some limitations at source data-center for HSR , I am considering for the backup-restore approach, in which the full backup is restored much ahead the cut-over date with option -Recover the database to specific data backup. Until the time of cut-over, we wish to apply the subsequent logs,without having to restore with any data backup.
We can do such log recovery in databases such as MS SQL and Oracle as long as the database is not open (for connections), but HANA DB automatically comes online for usage after recovery.

Hallo,
I have following issue.
We doing RRB with an internal order. the costs and quantity come from WBS element via settlement.
When we now doing DP91, the system find all the costs, but no quantity.
I am in correct view in DP91 and in odp1 it is set on costs and quantity.
Quantity are on the internal order too.
I checked everything but I do not find the reason.
Do you have an idea?
thx
It's because quantities are not recorded during settlement.  RRB is designed to not consider settlement postings.  Are you settling on original CE of Settlement CE's?
From consulting experience there is no need to have an IO in your process.  Run RRB from the project, that is the best practice.
Hi,
I use original CE. but the quantity is the internal order reports. i.e KOB1 and in test system it is working.
this solution is an exception for a small process. the others will directly billed from project.
Hallo,
issue solved.
In settlement, SAP do not settle the quantity if you do it as ful settlement.
We changed it to periodical settlement then is business transaction KOAL and not KOAO and it is working.

Hello Gurus,
Current enironment SAP S4HANA Eclipse based ABAP CDS Views.
As newbie on S4HANA, can we open any AfO query in eclipse workspace ?
I have checked all possibilities by searching BW, Infoprovider but there are no options.
Traditionally as I can recall any infoprovider query would be opened in BeX Analyzer in non editable mode.
Kindly correct me if I'm wrong but I'm struggling to open any AfO based query without BeX toolset.
Let me know if any body has faced such issue earlier so that they can direct me in getting necessary help out here.
It can be possible that there might be some plugins which might be missing - If so please help me out.
Thanks in advance.
Thanks,
Sachin
Hi Sachin,
to be honest... I don't get your issue.
An "AfO" query stand-alone does not exist. Either it is a BW query on top of an Infoprovider or it is a CDS Query on top of a CDS Cube view.
In S4 System also t-code RSRT exists and you can try to open whatever query exists in your S4 system.
If the Query inside the AfO workbook is not stored in your S4 system, then you will probably not be abled to open it from S4.
FYI: In BW the t-codes exist: RRMX and RAAOE exist, to open the one or the other addin.

Hi Madhava, 
Are you sending the payload in XML format? Since you have defined the request header Content-Type as "application/json", it would expect the payload in json format and throw an error as soon as the XML payload begins with the opening tag "<". 
Try changing the Content-Type header to "text/xml" instead if your payload is in XML format.

If my store procedure has a Date or Datetime Parameter, the report fails with a Syntax error when using "MS OLE DB Driver 19 for SQL Server" (MSOLEDBSQL19).
With "SQL Native Client 11" (SQLNCLI11) or "MS OLE DB Driver for SQL Server" (MSOLEDBSQL) the generated query is:
"DBNAME"."dbo"."STORED_PROCEDURE_NAME";1 {d '2023-02-14'}, {d '2023-02-14'}
with "MS OLE DB Driver 19 for SQL Server" (MSOLEDBSQL19) the generated query is:
"DBNAME"."dbo"."STORED_PROCEDURE_NAME";1 CONVERT(DATETIME, '02-14-2023', 110), CONVERT(DATETIME, '02-14-2023', 110)
The first query works in SSMS, but the second does not work in SSMS either. Does anyone know how to get it to format the query like the first way while using the newer driver?
And before anyone suggests it, staying on the older drivers is not an acceptable solution. We have rolled back to "MS OLE DB Driver for SQL Server" (MSOLEDBSQL) as a temporary work around while we look for the permanent fix.
EDIT 1: We are running the latest patch in both Crystal Reports 2020, as well as the .NET runtime. The behavior is the same in both. The Profile captures I reference above are from the Crystal Reports 2020.
Instead of connecting directly to the stored procedure, have you tried calling it in a command?

Hello,
We are considering to buy a Test & Demo license for SAP PFM and attach it to our existing internal training system, for training and demo purposes. We do not have a lot of testdata on this system yet like materials, BOMs, good movements etc.
Is there maybe an example datafile available that can be uploaded to an SAP-system to be used as testdata for this?
Thanks for any help!
Hi Erik, 
yes we provide a sample dataset that can be imported into PFM. Pls. see this Github repository: https://github.com/SAP-samples/product-footprint-management.
Best, Nico
Hi Nico, 
Thanks for your quick reaction. Yes I came across this GitHub-page, but I'm not sure this is what I'm looking for. These are only files to be uploaded to SAP PFM aren't they? So you simulate that there are coming from a SAP backend system? We want to test the whole flow, so download data from your backend, upload it to PFM, add footprint data, have PFM do the calculations and then report the results back to the SAP-backend (and see in which tables they land, that's the ABAP-er in me wanting to know that :))
But in order to have a valid testcase I need a realistic business structure on the back end, with a company code, multiple plants, materials, BOM's, production orders, goods movements and who knows what more. I wanted to check if there are maybe BC sets available that can be uploaded to the SAP backend system containing testdata.
Thanks again for any help Nico!
Regards,
Erik
Last question Nico Wottke. Would you be able to provide a document or instruction which data needs to be set up on the backend to be sure we have all the data set up correctly for export to PFM? Thanks again for any help!
Hello Everyone,
I'm a controlling consultant, i want to know what are the diffrences between having PaPM in HANA or BW?
Please, let me know is there any topics or links on web.
Hi Huseyin Cinar,
talking about SAP PaPM on premise or private cloud edition, when you install SAP PaPM in a standalone configuration (i.e. on plain NetWeaver, not on S/4HANA or BW/4HANA), SAP PaPM is actually going to use the SAP BW embedded functionalities.
Therefore, there is no difference between PaPM on HANA vs BW.
In addition, if you install SAP PaPM on SAP BW/4HANA, the difference is that you can leverage both SAP PaPM and SAP BW/4HANA data warehousing capabilities on the same data which resides on the same SAP HANA.
Finally, SAP PaPM Cloud (the SaaS version of PaPM) is a totally different story since it is not based on SAP NetWeaver platform, and would require a separate answer.
Hope it helps. Feel free to comment again for more information.

Hello,
I've created a Cross-tab report with multiple grouping on the rows.
this report is used to export to Excel and do further reporting on there with links to other excel sheets.
for this they need to have all grouping names repeated on all rows.
here an example:

how can I get Income Account, 500 and net Turnover to be repeated on all rows?
thanks,
Lucas
Hi,
Couple of options you can try this with:
1. Create a formula with all your row fields used combined (like <row field 1> & ' ' & <row field 2> & ' ' & <row field 3>) and use it as First row field in crosstab expert and suppress it.
2. Reduce the suppressed field width and height as much as possible to make it not visible and also can remove grid lines to make the First field invisible.
Alternatively, you can create a mock crosstab by creating a tabular report with required groups to make it look better if the information displayed is achievable through tabular report.
Hope that helps.
Thanks,
Raghavendra
There is no easy way to do this in a cross-tab.  Creating a tabular report can be a challenge as well, depending on the number of groups in the columns.  If you showed a little more of your crosstab, with information about your summary fields, I might be able to walk you through it.
Having said that, what I usually do in situations like this is write a command that will pivot the data into the format that I need.  If you'll post information about how you're summarizing the data along with the SQL that Crystal has generated and what type of database you're using, I might be able to help you out with the SQL for that.

Hello Dayal,
Sometimes there is a bug in VKDFS table. If there are 1-2 document like this you can delete from this table. 
Hi, we have IRPA solution in virtual environment. There is approx 8 different scenarios. Randomly (usually at least once in a month) jobs starting to get expired. I have no clue what the reason might be but it always helps to restart the desktop agent as I see it is stucked in "orange" status. Any idea if I may somehow set mail notifications in case job is expired? Or what might be the root cause of this? Thank you.
You can always try to set an email notifier on your iRPA trigger, a notifier on the "expired" status. 
I don't have any idea of the root cause of this, we've expierenced the same. 
I have a price condition that uses in its table the field payment term, but when I set the payment term the price condition is calculated correctly, but if I change de payment term or any other field used in condition table the price condition is not re-calculated automatically, it keeps the previous price value, I and I need click in update price button to get new value for condition. I would like to know how the condition price can be re-calculated automatically if I change the payment term or any other field used in condition price table using standard configuration or if there is no standard configuration, using some enhancement.
Thanks best regards.
Hello Marcelo Rodrigues de Jesus,
To update price automatically in sale order please set "Pricing type - B" in VTAA for your order type/item category.
VTAA--->select your sale doc type--->double click on Item---->Select your item category---double click on it and change pricing type

Neeraj Jain

Hello, 
I do not expect it to work automatically. 
Update - New Pricing is the way to update the Price incase the Master Data is changed after created of Sales order. 
You may use some Mass tool to reprice large number of Orders. 
Thanks, 
Hello Marcelo Rodrigues de Jesus,
You can do this in MV45AFZB, 
Check the xvbkd-zterm value and yvbkd-zterm ( old zterm and new zterm ) if there is a different after that trigger new pricing like this. 
Form USEREXIT_NEW_PRICING_VBKD 
 new_pricing = 'C'.
Hello everyone,
I would like to ask how to do with some function in WEBI report like SQL having clause? I have a dataset I like to calculate first measure (an average of sold items in sales manager dimension) and second measure (total costs per sold items on row level). But if I filter second measure the first one is recalculated. I tried to use NoFilter function, but I like to keep one dimension report filter. For this one dimension it is all right, that the measures are recalculated.
Thanks in advance

Hi Team,
Can we combine Mutiple select queries separated with semi column and can run in Hana?
Example: 
select 'ID' from "TableA" where NAME='TEST_USER';select 'ID' from "TableB" where JOB='Developer';
when we execute above query, we get below exception.
com.sap.db.jdbc.exceptions.JDBCDriverException: SAP DBTech JDBC: [257]: sql syntax error: incorrect syntax near "select": line 1 col 50
Yes you can, with an anonymous block, for example
However, that probably isn't what you want to do, a UNION might be more suitable, for example

I want to extract GL master data using MDMGX and import it into MDG using DIF. I have created Logical and physical file paths and the logical file name definition and maintained it in AL11. In Import Master Data I get the error Directory abcd is not valid.
My question is : When using DIF in MDG for Financials ,do I need to Set Up Data Transfer Using DIF ( similar to MDG-Material).I have not done this
Set Up Data Transfer Using DIF | SAP Help Portal (Material)
Steps 1.Create an XML-file port 2.Create Logical System 3.Create RFC connection 4.Maintain Distribution Model 5. Create Partner Profile 6. Maintain outbound message type settings in WE20
To be able to import IDoc-XML files the following set up activities need to be carried out:
1. Use transaction IDX1 to create two ports in the IDoc adapter, one for sending and the other for receiving
2. In transaction WE21 enter the receiver XML port using the same name as in step 1 above
3. In transaction BD54 enter the sender and receiver partner numbers as logical system names.
Please advise as to whether I need to configure the above settings for Data Export from source system for MDG-F.
Setting Up DIF for Financials only has File Directories requirements although it indicates As a minimum.

Hi,
I have a KPI dimension let say as below:
KPI 1 = Price
KPI 2 = Quantity
KPI3 = Revenue
I have an input template where I show all those 3 as a seperate row as below in the same table. I am calculating KPI3 Revenue via a data action and I don't want users to input revenue manually. 

There are couple of alternatives to achieve this but here are my questions:
1- Is there a way to achieve this data locking at story level? E.g. KPI3 is read only for this table in the story but others inputable
2- Creating a temporary member ( e.g. TEMP_REV) , storing values on this member for data action and creating KPI3 = TEMP_REV is an option( so that users won't be able to plan KPI3 in story ) but I have around 30 calculated KPIs like that and don't want to duplicate them . Is there a way to acheive this without duplicating them but within the same member ID ( e.g. via inverse formula or stg?)
3- I can create a data locking for KPI3 at model level but then it will throw lock error as data action will try to post records to a locked region, won't it? I am adming and I can bypass this but business uses won't be able to. Is there a way to bypass data lock for only specific data actions? 
You can select the Revenue measure row and use  Formatting styling  rules and make the Revenue measure as read only. This will be local to this story.

Hope this helps
Nikhil
thanks Nikhil Anand 
We also have VDT in the same story i.e. they see price and quantity feeds revenue in VDT format ( real life scenario is more complex with many KPIs). Can we do the same at VDT level as well? I see styling rule option is not available in VDT and we can only format as if it is read only (e.g. grey) and advise users to not to change it.
What is the best way of preventing them to input data to calculated KPIs where we calculate them via data action but not on the fly formulas?
Any idea William Yu

a) definition of ALE / EDI
ALE (Application Linking and Enabling) is SAP's technology to support distributed yet integrated processes across several SAP systems.
Read more: What is SAP ALE - Details (testingbrain.com)
SAP EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) is an electronic exchange of business transactional documents between different applications. It is a industry standard that describes electronic documents. These documents enables the internal transactions between associated companies to be automated. EDI is supported by the intermediate documents(IDOCS).
Read more: What is SAP EDI & Important SAP EDI Transactions - SAP Tutorial (saponlinetutorials.com)
Application Link Enabling is used to transfer transactional and master data from one system to another. EDI is used basically for communication between partners of a company or a firm.

b) Masterdata processing
Master data is all the data that is mission-critical to the running of a business. It describes people (customers, employees, and suppliers), places (offices and locations), and things (products and assets). Master data is typically just a small percentage of all business data, but it is some of the most complex – and valuable – data in an organization.

e) normal IDoc processing (ORDERS, INVOICE,...)
IDoc is an SAP object that carries data of a business transaction from one system to another in the form of electronic message. IDoc is an acronym for Intermediate Document. The purpose of an IDoc is to transfer data or information from SAP to other systems and vice versa. The transfer from SAP to non-SAP system is done via EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) subsystems whereas for transfer between two SAP systems, ALE is used.

Hello all,
Could someone please confirm is it possible to make batch management mandatory and batch number creation at the time of order creation in S4Hana Public Cloud??
If possible could you please explain how? (configuration path if needs to be done in configuration).
Thanks in advance!!!
Hello Suresh Eswaran.
How are you? If you go to the Material Master Data for the Material To Be Produced (Semi Finished Good or Finished Good), in MRP2 View, you have the Field "Batch Entry" and, inside it, there are 2 Options to make Mandatory the Batch Number Creation during the Release of the Production Order/Process Order. The options are:
1 = Manual batch determination required upon release of order
 3= Automatic batch determination upon release of order
The Batch Management Mandatory Field for General or for Plant can be defined if you check the Fields "Batch Management" and "Batch Management (Plant)" in the "Plant Data/Storage 1" View of Material Master Data.
I don´t think it is a Good Practice to determine the Batch Number during Production Order/Process Order Creation, as this Production Order/Process Order can be cancelled before Release, sasting a Batch Number.

Hello,
We need to migrate to the S/4 Hana Cloud system in a company with a new casuistry.
This company has materials that are used as components of a finished material. The process of converting these components into finished material is done through an external subcontracting company in which the manufacturing process is performed.
Our question is whether there is any possibility to contemplate this flow without having to go through the PP module.
By way of clarification: The flow would be:
1. The components are stored in a specific plant.
2. These components are sent to the subcontracted company. In this step, there would be a stock decrease of these materials in the corresponding plants.
3. The subcontracting order is placed with the corresponding supplier.
4. When the final product is received, a goods receipt is made at the relevant plant for that unit.
Thank you very much,
Regards.
Hello Alberto,
The subcontracting process can be triggered by an MRP or Manually, so if I got correctly your question (about going through the PP module) you can create the Purchase Order manually and skip the MRP process.

You will find the entire process flow and the steps needed here:
https://rapid.sap.com/bp/scopeitems/BMY
Please let me know if you need more details or, can you provide more context about which steps from the Manufacturing Line of Business (PP module) you want to skip?
Best regards,
Gabriel
Hello Gabriel,
We have done the flow and in principle it would fit with what we need. 
However, the accounts to which the goods receipt is posted, both for movement 101 and 543 (Goods receipt from components) require an account assignment in CO. 
At no point do we have the possibility to change or add the cost allocation for the final material from Goods Receipt.
What are the options?
Thank you very much,
Regards.
Hi Alberto,
These accounts are determined in account determination process, you can find more details in SSCUI 100297. More details can be found in the KBA below?

Hi Experts,
I am trying to create mailforms in webui for sending mails to the business partners based on the status change in Change Request Management Transaction types (For e.g.. ZMCR, ZMMJ, ZMHF, ZMSG,….) But I didn’t get an option to choose Service Request as Attribute context in Web Ui Screen.


I have referred the note “2658408 - "Service Request Attributes" in Mail Form Attribute Context is missing” but the type = Service Request Management is missing in “CRM->Marketing->Marketing Planning and Campaign Management->Personalized Mail->Maintain Attribute Contexts for Mail Forms”

 
Also, I have activated the Business functions “CRM_SHSVC and CRM_IC_CEBP” in SFW5 but I am not able to proceed further in mail forms creation.

Hello all,
I believe Multiple specification for QM is not available in S4Hana (Public) cloud!
Do we have any alternate or similar feature app for the same in public cloud?
Hello Suresh Eswaran.
How are you? The functionality for Specifications in SAP S/4HANA Cloud is Deprecated since Release 1908, according to SAP Note 2792363 - SAP S/4HANA Cloud 1908 (And All Future Releases): Deprecated Scope Items in R&D/Engineering: (2792363 - SAP S/4HANA Cloud 1908 (and all future releases): Deprecated Scope Items in R&D/Engineering - SAP ONE Support Launchpad)
Inside this SAP Note you can see that the Scope Item 1QA - Specification Management for Recipes (SAP Best Practices Explorer) is one of the Deprecated Scope Items.
So, for this moment, there is no functionality for Specification is SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition.

Hi,
I have Fiori List Report based on the CDS view and annotations. I have added below annotations for the intent based navigation as well.
@Consumption.semanticObject: 'SemanticObjectName'
@UI.lineItem: [ { position: 10, label: 'Document Number'},
 {type: #FOR_INTENT_BASED_NAVIGATION, semanticObjectAction: 'display'}]
 key DocumentNo
It works fine as I have hardcoded the semanticObject name in the annotation. 
However, in my use case, I need to use the SemanticObject name from one of the fields in the CDS view as each record could have different semanticObject and action.
So, instead of hardcoding the name, how can I pass from the element within the CDS view?
If this can't be achieved through CDS view annotations, my another option would be to add custom code in List Report application in the controller. 
For this, I need to know the event name which is being triggered when user clicks on the number ( which is formatted with the link for navigation due to the above annotations). If we know the event and if I know how to extend that event, I can put together a code to navigate to specific intent by reading the table fields and generating the correct intent and action.
Let me know if any one have any ideas or directions in which I can go to resolve this.
Thank you,
Bhavik

After SAP Upgrade from 2011 to 2211, we've had problems logging in with our D2 environment. Basically, what happens is that after typing the email address in Microsoft login page, the expectation is we are redirected to our IdP but what happens is we are redirected back to the Microsoft login page after several seconds. SAP found out in their technical analysis about this particular bean and they commented this line. I'm not sure if this is the reason because we have this bean existing in 2 different XML files. One is in spring-security-config.xml in our storefront extension while the other is in our core extension inside file, samlsinglesignon-spring-security-config.xml. In our local, this issue is not happening by the way.
<bean id="webSSOprofileConsumer" class="org.springframework.security.saml.websso.WebSSOProfileConsumerImpl"><property name="responseSkew" value="300"/></bean>
Edit: I had a discussion with someone from SAP and the issue has nothing to do with the above bean. The issue happens because of InvalidateSessionAndMarkRequestStrategy. Somehow, our session id in the cookie is not being invalidated after authentication. SAP developer also mentioned about HybrisSessionFixationProtectionStrategy which we already have in our spring-security-config.xml. The onAuthentication method of HybrisSessionFixationProtectionStrategy is not called during my debug starting from Microsoft login until landing in our application. Can you please help me finding out why it isn't called? I don't have stale session property in our local.properties (SAP confirmed we can use this approach but it is not recommended security-wise).
spring-security-config.xml:
<security:http entry-point-ref="samlStorefrontEntryPoint" use-expressions="false">
    <security:session-management session-authentication-strategy-ref="fixation" invalid-session-url="/saml/login" />...</security:http>

<bean id="fixation" class="de.hybris.platform.servicelayer.security.spring.HybrisSessionFixationProtectionStrategy"/>
Dear Gurus,
We are implementing the agents commissions process for a client using condition contracts in S4H.
When we do a partial settlement for a month, the settlement document correctly captures the commission to be paid to the vendor:

Billing document populates RCA1 with the commission amount as defined in the condition contract:

Settlement document captures the same amount 

When we do a final settlement for this contract, the settlement document is populating both the commission for that particular month + 2 entries for the previous settlements:

Settlement document with 3 entries:

Questions:
1. Is this standard SAP behavior for the final settlement?
2. Can we control this somewhere and prevent the double entry for the previous settlement in the final settlement document?
Any help is appreciated.

I have requirement like proxy to rest(POST API with credentials) in PI 7.5
Maintained credentials in basic authentication.

When i checked ping channel here is http options 403 error could you please tell is it issue or not?
I have installed ssl cert in TrustedCAs.

The issue is i am getting 204 code when i call API.
Could you please help on this issue.
Thanks & Regards,
Dileep
Hi Dileep, 
looks like you don't have permission on target side to use HTTP OPTIONS, this might be not mandatory for your scenario, in contrary looks like HTTP GET is possible. 
I would suggest to build simple POC ICO and cover your GET/POST requirements to make sure you can connect properly and not missing any permission on target side. 
For HTTP 204 it is more related to the target API and specific of that call. Do you have access to API specification? 
BR, Piotr 
204 No Content is not exactly an error. It just means that the resource your URL is trying call is no longer available or have been moved.
For example if your make an API call to approve a PR through a cart no. in URL and someone else (person or other job) has already approved it before call from your API, you will get a 204 Status code. 
It doesn't mean the call has failed, it just mean the parameters you have provided in your call are no longer pointing to any resource on target server. 
And 404 in ping just mean the target API host can't handle OPTIONS REQUESTS, you are fine to ignore it.
Dear Sir,
I have scenario Proxy (sap) to Rest(non sap)-SAP PI 7.5
Here third party has given Rest API with username and password.
I have tryed in postman with NO AUTH then got 204 NO CONTENT after tryed with BASIC AUTH using credentials then got 200 OK got response.But in PI Rest receiver channel has general tab in that BASIC AUTHORIZATION tab is maintained credentials then server returned code:204 and log is ERROR ENCOUNTERED EXECUTING MAPPING:PREMATURE END OF FILE.
Could you please tell where could we maintain Username and password in rest receiver channel.
Please find ping channel screenshot
tmp-67e6345f-028e-4ed9-8270-fc5cfc24bd24.png 
Thanks and Regard,
Dileep
Not sure if you still have this issue. but you are passing credentials correctly in "Basic Authorization" section. Thats why you have 200 OK in status.
I believe the reason for "ERROR ENCOUNTERED EXECUTING MAPPING:PREMATURE END OF FILE" is because you are not converting JSON to XML or during the initial call. 
Please check.
Question is in the title. If that is the case, is there some way to increase the amount of versions for a particular fact sheet, let's say from 5 versions to 15 versions stored?
Dear Sir,
We have a scenario Proxy to Rest(PI 7.5).
Third party is given API with username and password so could you please tell where can we maintain these credentials.
Thanks and Regards,
Dileep

Also make sure to upload SSL certificate of the API service in key store. You can download it using any browser.

Dear all,
I know about the simple query (and this might be my "answer") and also skimmed over this blog by Raffael Herrmann 
I want to know if theres a "simple" solution to get the following information out from my PI / PO system

All data types, IDocs, RFCs, external definitions, ... (basically anything that can hold data) that contain a field with the following attributes for filtering
- Name (like "costCenter")
- Type (like "string")
- Length (like 10)

My usage would be that I'd like to know which interfaces deal with cost centers.
I was also thinking about where used lists from ERP (as that is where the cost centers origin from) and try to filter that down to proxy objects, but that would leave out RFCs and IDocs and also would need several "where-used" hops
I fear that I already gave my answer above but maybe someone smarter came accross a solution (that might be a paid third party tool) to support in such situations

Hi Jens,
Your assumption is correct: there is a 3rd party solution which offers this kind of search functionality, beside many other useful features.
The tool is called UDO and I am working for this company.
Here is an example, searching for the String "CostCenter" in all mapping types:

The hits are displayed

...and from here you can click on the results and see the details e.g.

Hello,

We have installed several HANA Databases (SPS12.0 and SPS11.2) and different SAP systèmes have been connected : S/4 HANA , SAP ECC EhP8.
The HANA Database is always running on its own server, and the SAP system running on its distinct server.
The SAP system has been connected to HANA through its Virtual IP adress.
For example we just installed a HANA Database on its physical IP adress sapt01hana1
The Virtual IP adress of the HANA server is hanatest

The SAP Netweaver system has been installed and conencted to HANA through its virtual IP adress : hanatest

In hdbusersore there is no mention whatsoever of the physical hostname ,only the virtual hostname
sapt01d01:t01adm 59> hdbuserstore LIST
DATA FILE : /home/t01adm/.hdb/sapt01d01/SSFS_HDB.DAT
KEY FILE : /home/t01adm/.hdb/sapt01d01/SSFS_HDB.KEY

KEY DEFAULT
 ENV : hanatest:30015
 USER: SAPECC

In the DEFAULT profile, the virtual hostname of the DB has been configured during the installation :
SAPDBHOST = hanatest

Connection from SAP system to virtual hostname of the DB works fine
hdbsql=> \c -n hanatest -i 00 -u SAPECC -p Mypassword
Connected to QHA@sapt01hana1.****.com:30015

I checked with netstat and SAP system is communicating with its DB through the virtual IP adress only

But in SAP screens, only the physical hostname of the DB is displayed, not the virtual hostname :



Here a screenshot of DBACOCKPIT, or System---|Statut.
I do not understand why the virtual hostname is not being picked up
I checked DBCO entries : there was no DEFAULT entry, so I created one pointing to the virtual hostname it did not change anything




Thank you for your attention
Hi Raoul,

This situation is normal. In my case, one application connects to HANA virtual hostname, where HANA is configured in system replication mode. After performing take over, the hostname shows the physical hostname of new primary.  

I just guess the hostname in DBACOCKPIT is get from hostname command in OS. 

Regards,
Ning
Thank you Ning and Lucas !
We have used the virtual hostname in the SAP APPL hdbuserstore KEY DEFAULT, but DBACOCKPIT/DB02 showed physical hostname of primary when HANA lived on primary site. No possibility to adjust in DBAOCKPIT as Raoul Shiro already wrote. After takeover to secondary site, dbacockpit shows the physical hostname of the secondary site, without manual intervention :-)

Hallo SAP BTP Extension Developers,
during yesterdays SAP TechEd 2021 "Experts and Executives in the Keynote Exchange" the following question was brought up: "How do you think the topic of governance will play in the proper adoption of low code, no code platforms?"
That where the answers by Jürgen, Thomas and Julia (links to the starting location in the YouTube Video).
In Side-By-Side Extension projects I'm facing the issue that I'm currently not able to consume detailed Object authorizations from S/4HANA (Cloud). Let's give me more details:
When you're developing Side by Side Apps on SAP BTP using the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) you can implement the general authorizations baled on Roles. Such roles are assigned in BTP Cloud Foundry to Role Collections. The Role Collections can be assigned to a user using mapping of SAML Group Assertions, automated assignment using SAP Identity Provisioning or manual assignment by an Admin. But those roles are are rather broad restrictions. In most cases you will have an admin rolle that gives access to the applications used for to configure technical settings it. Another role might be a business admin that does the customizing. And last but not least you have application specific roles like a processor and approver.
But this roles are not suficcient to restric the access to specific business objects. CAP has the concept of User Attributes and you can fill them using SAML Assertions. But I doubt that any customer would invest the effort to replicate the S/4HANA Authorization Objects to the Identity Provider (IdP). Let's take the example "V_KONH_VKO - Condition: Authorization for Sales Organizations". This Object has already 4 attributes:
VKORG Sales OrganizationVTWEG Distribution ChannelSPART DivisionACTVT Activity
and that is just a single authorization object. I don't think that SAML Assertions are the right way to bring them to the Cloud applicaiton. Authorizations like the restriction of Sales Organizations are part of S/4HANA (Cloud).
On a technical level accessing the authorization objects would be possible using the RFC enabled function module SUSR_USER_AUTH_FOR_OBJ_GET. But to call this function module using a SAP Supported Build Pack in SAP BTP Cloud Foundry I'm forced to use Java. Only there I have support for the Java Connector (JCo). If you're building CAP using Node.JS this results in an extra runtime (longterm costs) and skills that you might not have in your team.
Here is my wish:
SAP please get together with the SAP developers building Side-By-Side extensions and work on a concept how such detailed authorizations can be consumed from S/4HANA (Cloud). 
Best RegardsGregor Wolf
This was also cross posted in the DSAG Working Group for BTP: Zugriff auf S/4HANA Berechtigungsobjekte in Side-By-Side Extension
CC: Juergen MUELLER, Thomas Saueressig

While we are on the subject of authorization, we have similar issues with SuccessFactors. Customers would like to use the SF internal authorization as basis for BTP apps. 
So the aspirational target should be a consistent authorization management across all SAP solutions (including BTP). 
Hi there,
I would like to know if it is possible to implement a generic logic to dynamically read from database tables.
I would like to do something like this:
CLASS reader DEFINITION  CREATE PUBLIC.  PUBLIC SECTION.  METHODS read    IMPORTING      table TYPE REF TO data.ENDCLASS.CLASS reader IMPLEMENTATION.  METHOD read.    ##todo " how could I determine the run time type of table as string?    DATA database_table TYPE string.    FIELD-SYMBOLS <table_ref> TYPE ANY TABLE.    ASSIGN table TO <table_ref>.    ##todo " how could I read data dynamically from (database_table) my result table?    SELECT    FROM (database_table)    FIELDS *    INTO TABLE @<table_ref>.  ENDMETHOD.
ENDCLASS.
START-OF-SELECTION.  DATA table_content TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF pa0015 WITH EMPTY KEY.  DATA(reader) = NEW reader( ).  reader->read( table = REF #( table_content ) ).
BR,Daniel
This code does something similar and should be of help.
You can pass the name of the database table, the filter string (where clause), the field_string (select clause) and opt to include a header line in the output.
The output is a list of strings, pipe delimited fields. But you can easily change that to be tab delimited by using cl_abap_char_utilities=>horizontal_tab instead.

When I create a return order RE with reference to invoice F2 in VA01 the system shows an error message copying from sales document type F2 to RE is not supported. 
When I open T-Code VTAF, there is a message that "No entries found that match selection criteria". So I create new entries here and saved them. 
But still, the issues of copying F2 to RE arise again when I create a return order with reference to the invoice. And when I check the data which I saved before here in VTAF, there is no data available now. With the same screen message "No entries found that match selection criteria". And I also have the same data problem with VTFL and VTFF too.
Please help me to resolve this issue.
We want to create a sub module in existing CAPM Project .Existing project structure is like :
<PROJECT-ROOT>/|-- db/`-- data-model.cds`-- srv/|-- cat-service.cds|-- src/main/java/|-- src/gen/java/`-- node_modules/Just like the "srv" folder structure we want to create another module.How to achieve the same?
Thanks in advance...!!!
Hi Surbhi,assuming the following project structure:<PROJECT-ROOT>/|-- db/`-- data-model.cds`-- srv/|-- cat-service.cds|-- src/main/java/|-- src/gen/java/`-- srv2/|-- cat2-service.cds|-- src/main/java/|-- src/gen/java/`-- node_modules/In order to generate the correct CDS build output you have to configure the build tasks as shown below. This will create the EDMX files as well as a compiled CSN model for each service. See https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/deployment/#build-config for further details.
Hello Experts, 
Need your guidance in BTP Trial account, I was using BTP Trial account for a very long time. But since yesterday I am not able to open the project template page and Odata service reads stopped working. I am only able to work with hardcoded values in the view. 
This is the below error i am getting when trying to open the new project template page after this failure as said above Odata service read from Northwind or loading a local JSON file for data is also stopped working. When there is a odata read the system will say no data and sometimes even stop showing the output. I have even copy pasted many sample codes from multiple sources to check if there is any human error from my side. but no it is not working if there is a odata read in any form. There is no error in console also. 
Have tried restarting the server, logged off and logged in again, waited for a day to get this issue solved on its own, even created a new dev space to check. BUT NONE of the trick worked. 
Any one else know what is the issue here and how to solve it?
Thanks in advance.

Greetings,
is it possible to use the CDC Connector for SAP Hana systems in MS Azure to connect to an SAP ME 15.5 system?
When configuring the connector in azure a server name, system number and client number is needed.
The server name is probably the url of the ME, but what about the system number? Is this referred to an number of the ME or the hana database behind it?
Any help or informations would be appreciated.
Best Regards,
Jannes
Hi Jannes,
not completely sure, but it looks like SAP ME is not running on an ABAP-based application server (like R/3 or S/4), but on a NetWeaver AS Java. This means that things like "system number" and "client number" do not exist for SAP ME.
We would need more details about this CDC Connector, but if it requires system number and client number, then most probably it can only be used for connecting to ABAP-based application servers, not Java-based ones?!

Just wondering if anyone has an idea on how to achieve the following:
Requirement: When I click on the table I'd like the clicked value to be shown in the text box.Could be either a dimension or measure - from any column/row in the table.e.g. If I click the value 'Los Angeles' - that's what is shown in the text box or I could click 0.09 in the Quantity sold column , so I'd want to see 0.09 in the text box.I've got it partially working, just not fully dynamic (a user could click any cell in the table)

For the dimensions I can only get it working via hardcoding a dimension (so doesn't really deliver what I want)var sel = tbl.getSelections()[0];var result = tbl.getDataSource().getResultMember("Product_3e315003an",sel).description;txt_box.applyText(result)
For measures this works
var sel = tbl.getSelections()[0]; var value = tbl.getDataSource().getData(sel).formattedValue;txt_box.applyText(value);
So i need to find a way to wrap it all into one script that dynamically puts whatever value is clicked in the text boxand can dynamically tell which dimension has been clicked.
Very late update :)
This code worked for me - very clunky and only good for a table containing 1 Dim and 1 Measure
Hi James Barlow, you are using the right methods. However, the limitation comes from the getSelection method which will give you the full coordinates if you click on a header cell. You can think of it as if there is no cell spanning and all tuples of one row are treated as one cell. I would suggest to to file your requirement at https://influence.sap.com/.
 In the meantime as always I am curious what other ideas the community comes up with to help you.
Hi ,
var sel = tbl.getSelections()[0];
If we use the above code then we will be getting both the dimension in it (product and location )
as per the current limitation, we can get only one dimension from the table 
I would suggest the display both the dimension in the text box.
use the following code.
var sel = tbl.getSelections();var result = "Selected product = " +sel[0]["product"] + "Selected Location =" + sel[0]["Location"]
txt_box.applyText(result)
Thanks,
Saurabh S.
Hi everybody, Please vote for idea 280582: Improvement Request Details - Customer Influence (sap.com) ; This should solve the limitation "only good for a table containing 1 Dim"; Thanks
Hello, 
with the release of AFO 2.8 SP4 it's possible to read the SAPUILandscape.xml file locally or on a remote server without the installation of the SAP GUI. 
We would like to know how to build the corresponding SAPUILandscape.xml file.
Until now, we have set the attribute "SAPGUI" for the variable "ServerType". Does anyone know what has to be adjusted there if there is no SAP GUI installed on the computer anymore?
Thanks in advance.

Is there an out-of-the-box functionality to send Dunning Data with Excel attachment alongside PDF attachment? 
Hi Alejandro Lopez Zeron , 
No, there is no such standard functionality. And when we speak about custom functionality, it is also not an easy task to generate Excel file in background. So if you have a requirement of this kind, I'd suggest to check with your developer some open source projects e.g. abap2xlsx - https://github.com/abap2xlsx/abap2xlsx, which can take care of the generation of Excel file.

Hello experts,
I am new here.At the moment, I was trying to post good receive (MIGO), yet there was an error below.Also, it is ok when I use fiscal year K4, but when I config with V3, this error happened.I did references answer related to this topic, I still can not solve this error.Please help me to solve them. Thank you so much!
I attached the detail in the photo belows:

Dear Tuyen Tran,
You can refer to this thread:
https://answers.sap.com/questions/13813025/posting-only-possible-in-periods-202211-and-202210.html
I would recommend to start with second solution mentioned in the link including transaction MMRV.
You can accept answer if helpful.
Just like that you cannot change fiscal year variant from K4 to V3 for your company code. You have below options and decide which option you wanted for your company code = >
If fiscal year variant is K4-  Your 1st period is January 2023 and 12th period is December 2023 for Calender year 2023
If fiscal year variant is V3-  Your 1st period is April 2023 and 12th period is March 2024 for Calender year 2023 OR Your 1st period is April 2022 and 12th period is March 2023 for Calender year 2022
*** For fiscal year variant  K4-  this is February 2023 and your current period is 02
**** For fiscal year variant  V3-  this is February 2023 and your current period is 11
Hi,
i have seen in ServiceLayer Documentation, that there is possible to send multiple requests in one call to the Service Layer. In my opinion not very nice (some difficult multipart structure of the message, not just JSON).
In B1IF there is a B1 DI Batch Call Atom, where I can send multiple requests in one Call.
Is there any possibilty to do so with Service Layer Call in B1IF?
Hi,
I suggest using Split atom to split all SL call payloads. Also, depending on the amount of requests you plan to send, it would be useful to set it so that you have a Split followed by DBQO (PUT to Queue) and then a separate step which takes incoming requests from that Queue and then posts to SL. This would improve your error handling possibilities and would allow for processing of all valid requests.

 Hello everyone and sorry to bother you,
 Has anyone had to work with PMRs to which, in an intermediate process of the same OF, before post the final product to be manufactured, you have to post a By-Product also from the RF? 
 Among others, in Internet we have found this: By-Product receipt with SAP EWM API (bizadept.com)
 From that, we have understood of the same one, if we do not have to make a EGR document, apparently, from EWM it is not necessary to do anything special
 The problem is that we are getting the By-Product post in queue with this error:
 The pos.V51VP does not exist: Action cancelled HUGENERAL 56. 
 And it is because in the LIPS the type of movement is not being recorded: LIPS-BWART
 Despite the difficulty of searching for notes in this case (when we search for "by-product" it also searches for "product"), we have applied some of them, but without success...
 Hence this mail... Have any of you encountered this problem and can you help us?
 In any case, thanks, and sorry again for this "SOS"...

Hello,
I am using annotations DataFieldWithURL and the link is open up in the same window. 
How can it be open in a separate window ?
Thanks,
Javier

Hello,
The annotation 'datefieldwithurl' doesnt have an inbuilt property to force a new browser page. There are two ways you can achieve this.
1. If using annotations, return the 'url' like this-> |javascript:void( window.open('| && |{ url }| && |') )|
adding the javascript function to the final url will force the browser to open a new page.
2. If not using annotation, add an 'onclick' or 'onpress' event and then use 'sap.m.URLHelper.redirect(url, true)' in the handler
Thanks,
Rahul
Hello Javier,
DataFieldWithUrl as per the UI Vocabulary doesn't offer this capability. That is also aligned with the Fiori design principles for navigation. You can take a look at the design principal here. The introduction section itself describe the following
Navigation in SAP Fiori follows standard navigation paradigms of various web applications. When a user navigates to a new screen, the user’s system default navigation is in place. Depending on individual browser settings and functionality, new screens can also be opened in a new tab or window by using a long tap or right-click (using a mouse)
Hope this answers why do you see this annotation capability. I would strongly recommend you to keep your application aligned to the Fiori design guideline so that end users have a consistent user experience through out. 
Regards,
Vinod 
Hello Javier,
Good to know that you found a solution. 
I kindly request you to provide a feedback to Fiori guideline with details of your use case so they consider the same in future.
Regards,
Vinod 
Gopal,
Please add attachPress to your field ID. This will make your field clickable. You can find this ID in Elements tab in Developer Tools.
Attach a function from where you can launch the URL in a separate window: yourField.attachPress(this.yourNewFunction).

Hope this helps.

I solved it by adding this to my Component.js:
Dear Expert,
This issue only happens to a USD vendor code. The exchange loss posting is not created for USD A/P invoice paid in LC for this Vendor. 
Here is the scenario of how the A/P is paid :
1. Vendor BP: USD 
2. Create an A/P Invoice with an exchange rate of USD 1.3 to LC
3. Create an Outgoing payment for the Invoice with an exchange rate of USD 1.4
4. Select an All currencies bank account and paid in LC
5. Key in the total amount in LC that cover the Balance due 
After the Outgoing payment is added, A JE has been created: the Cr Bank account and Dr the Vendor with Dr the Realized Exchange Loss account. This results in an outstanding balance in LC. There is no problem when is paid in USD for the same bank and exchange rate. The issue can be reproduced with the same Vendor. It can not be reproduced by copying the vendor's BP master and creating the invoice and payment. 
The system is running 9.1 SAP Business One

I have to upload long text in routings operations in mass.
it is a specific operation which is not positioned always in the same activity number (can be 10, 15, 60 etc.)
I have the correct LSMW but I don't know how to find the correct Text name for all.
I know that I can find the text name in the word window in Header but that is for one routing: I cannot possibly search 2500 routings....
is there a way to find the text name with a table? 
I tried STXH and STXL but they will have an entry only if the text already exists.
Help!!

The users error encounter error " Enter a valid value for "Whse" field- 08"when opening an old GRPO and Invoice. The system shows document header information correctly without line details associated to warehouse code 08. The Whose code 08 was acturally an inactive Warehouse code. The query shows that every things in the associated trasaction table are correct. The system just cannot display them in GRPO and A/R Invoice windows.

Hello,
I am trying to see if it is possible to call any of the API's for the Inbox for Cloud Foundry from an external system. (Documentation found here: https://api.sap.com/api/SAP_CP_Workflow_TCM_CF/resource)
The documentation says that the API's will provide data "for the current user" or the "currently logged-in user" but does not give an option to pass the user as a Parameter, (for example to find a User's "Substitutes" in a Workflow)
Is it possible to call these API's from Postman or a CAP App for example with a technical user and only the name/id of the User who's details are requested? It seems these API's can only be accessed from a User who is already authenticated in the sub-account layer and not the Space level. 
(The API's for the Workflow (https://api.sap.com/api/SAP_CP_Workflow_CF/overview) don't provide any information regarding the current processor's of a Task's substitute, which is why the Inbox API's need to be looked into.)
Thanks

Hello,
My current IQ database is of version SAP IQ/16.0 SP11.06 and I am planning to upgrade to SAP IQ 16.1 SP05.
I would like to upgrade on a new system, can I install the 16.1 SP05 binaries, restore 16.0 SP11 from backup and then proceed to the upgrade?
OR
Do I have to install the oldest version first, restore and then proceed with binaries installation and upgrade procedure?
I looked through the doc but didn't find anything conclusive? If you have this somewhere, that would be appreciated!
Thanks 
(Edited because it was early in the morning and forgot to behave ;o)
Yes, you can restore the previous version database backup to the new version binaries, and then upgrade the database.
Functionally, this is the same as if you had upgraded the binaries on an existing server.
Make sure that you follow the steps for upgrading the database to the new version:

How to change the Delivery item Stag date(refer to screenshot) "Material Staging/Availability Date" ?
which ABAP / BAPI can be used to update/change the "Stag. Date" ?

Hello Pubudu Gunasekera
The WS_DELIVERY_UPDATE and WS_DELIVERY_UDPATE_2 functions are commonly used to maintain deliveries. However neither of them allows update of availability dates. I'd say you best shot is using CALL TRANSACTION to VL02N in background.

Hello, Community.
We have the situation when a person has one employment and forms of Performance&Goals. Then we make concurrent employment for this person, make it primary and terminate person from the previous employment. We need that person and it`s manager can see all the performance forms (from all the previous employments).
If we give a person RBP like to see performance forms on self, person does not see all the forms from the previous employments (because username and ID are different). 
Person can only see all the forms from the previous employments, if we give RBP for all (but we need that people can see only their own forms or forms of their subordinates).
Maybe someone has come across a similiar situation and can suggest a solution?

By my knowledge there is no easy fix for this. The problem is indeed that the forms are bound to the user, not the the person-id external, which requires a user to use the button at the top of the employee's page and then switch to the prior employment to see old ones (assuming you have enabled the portlet that shows prior year performance forms). You could of course route the form to the new manager if it is active, but apart from that there's not much (without concessions on the performance forms) what can be done in my knowledge. 
Hello everyone,
How can I order tables that use cross calculations from linked models?
Whenever I link two models through dimension links at the story, I'm unnable to order data.
Any work around? Thanks in advance!
Dear Expert,
I want to know how to do the setup for a non-inventory ( service item) with item cost posted to the COS account. 
Here is the scenario:
1) A non-inventory item for sales is created with the valuation method: Standard and item cost: $50
2) Issue a SO and it is converted to Delivery and Invoice.
3) The item cost, $50, is reflected in the GP window and the Sales Analysis Report
4) No journal posting is generated for the delivery as it is a non-inventory item
5) For the journal posting of the A/R Invoice, it debits the customer account and credits the sales account
Item cost indicated in the row of Delivery and Invoice is $50, but no posting is created. I can see that there is a Cost of Goods Sold Account in the row. I wonder if it is the default posting code copied from G/L Account Determination. Unlike the Inventory item, the system debits Stock and credits inventory for $50, there is no journal entry created for the non-inventory item. 
The standard cost of $50 defined in the item master is used for calculating the GP(if Item cost is selected for GP calculation) for reporting purposes and is reflected in the sales analysis report. There is no accounting effect at all.
My question is: How to do the setup to assign a fixed labour cost for the service performed to a customer? There is no account tab to define the posting code as the' Advanced G/L Account Determination' is enabled in the Basic Initialization tab for Company Setup.
Best regards,
Helen Jim
I think it is not possible to post non-inventory items or drop-ship warehouses to general ledger. However, if you define standard cost then this cost will be used for gross profit calculation, so you can create custom report from INV1.
Hi Expert,
The base price for the Gross Profit calculation of the Credit Memo is set to"Item cost". But the GP shown in the Sales Analysis report is not tally with the actual GP.
To my understanding, it happens if the base price is not set to "Item Cost".
May I know what is the possible reason for this? 
Best regards,
Leanne To
Is this question related to Business One or ECC?  If it is ECC, then, you have to enlighten more on where do you see "Item Cost"? Which sales analysis report not tally ?
Also, it is not clear why a credit memo should have gross profit calculation.  Only in commercial invoice, this is required and not in credit memo
Hi Helen,
as far as I know, is the GrossProfit in this report taken from the documents.
Open a document from the report and take a look at:

The baseprice can be changed in the document lines as well.

Hi,
I'm trying to understand if the Role Management from CAP works with SAP BuildApps when consuming the service defined in a Destination on BTP.
My CAP service cds:
using {sample.api.db as sa} from '../db/schema';service SampleAPIService @(path : '/sampleApiSrv') @(requires : [    'authenticated-user',    'system-user']){    entity SampleEntity as projection on sa.SampleEntity;    entity SampleReadEntity @(restrict: [         { grant: ['*'], to: 'CREATOR' },        { grant: ['READ'], to: 'READER' }    ]) as projection on sa.SampleReadEntity;    entity SampleCreateEntity @(restrict: [         { grant: ['*'], to: 'CREATOR' }    ]) as projection on sa.SampleCreateEntity;}
xs-security.json file:
{    "xsappname": "SampleApiPoc",    "tenant-mode": "dedicated",    "description": "Security profile of called application",    "scopes": [        {            "name": "uaa.user"        },        {            "name":"$XSAPPNAME.READER",            "description": ""        },        {            "name":"$XSAPPNAME.CREATOR",            "description": ""        }    ],    "role-templates": [        {            "name": "Token_Exchange",            "description": "UAA",            "scope-references": [                "uaa.user"            ]        },        {            "name": "Reader",            "description": "Role with Read rights",            "scope-references": [                "$XSAPPNAME.READER"            ]        },        {            "name": "Creator",            "description": "Role with all CRUD rights",            "scope-references": [                "$XSAPPNAME.CREATOR"            ]        }    ]}
On BTP I have my destination configured and the Role Collections created for each Role Scope defined (with the Token_Exchange).
The destination is using the OAuth2ClientCredentials authentication type.
On SAP Build Apps after I add the BTP authentication I'm able to see the Destination and the entities, but for some reason only see the data for the "SampleEntity". For the "SampleReadEntity" or "SampleCreateEntity" I get a Failed to load data (403) even though my user is assigned to the Role Collections with the correct Scopes on BTP.
Is there any extra step on SAP Build Apps to get the Access Token? If so, how and how to make it dynamic in order to consider all the scopes assigned for my user on BTP?
I see that when creating a Basic List for example on UI Canvas it is possible to add Authentication to the Properties of the Configuration, but this seems to accept only Static Text for the Token information which should be dynamic when the authentication is done. Nevertheless, tried it as well and the output is the same.
Hello All,I receive a strange issue while saving or editing a public variant in the Fiori app. The error says
Transport request to record change of file missing (package ZPM_FM)<br>
Please refer the attached screenshot. The issue is only for SAP_UI version 7.55 or lower. My user currently has the key user role 'SAP_UI_FLEX_KEY_USER'
Hello All,The issue was resolved by myself in the following way.1. Open the debugger console of your browser when running the Fiori App or App Variant in the Launchpad.
2. Try to make any changes in a variant which has been set as Public.
3. After selecting a workbench transport request(SAP_UI ≤ 7.55), click on save.
4. You will notice there is an error with one of the PUT request. Look for a PUT request whose format is like  '/sap/bc/lrep/changes/id_1676928392411_392_defaultVariant?sap-language=en' 
5. The error response says 'Transport request to record change of file missing (package ZXX_XX)'
6. Copy the file name 'id_1676928392411_392_defaultVariant' from the URL.
7. You can look for the entry in the table '/UIF/LREPDCONT' by giving Namespace as '*id_1676928392411_392_defaultVariant*'
8. Run the report '/UIF/DELETE_FILE' and enter the table entry details as per step 7 and execute

Repeat the steps, if there are multiple issues with the variant.Do not forget to clear the system cache after this.

Does anyone knows how to remove tables from SQVI Quick Viewer once the join's already created?
It was inserted 3 tables (LFA1, LFB1 and LFM1) so I just need to remove the last one from there.

I've tried many threads in the forum but most of them has no helpful answer and some others are too old and outdated.
Some of the suggestions says to just re-create it. But, is it really the only solution?

Thanks in advance.
Rafael.
Goto SQVI Quick viewer in change mode, when in Basic mode - Click on the "Data Source" tab and click on "Change Join" to navigate to Quick viewer design screen ( graphical ). Select the LFM1 table window and click "Delete" ( or Edit-> Delete table ).
I know this is old , but I have a workaround for this problem: right click on the link to the table you don't want anymore and set it to "left outer join". This will make the table rather irrelevant on your selection, as if you had eliminated it.
Hi rvsilvax,

what reason ever: It's not possible. No way, re-create a new one. Will take you less time than finding out why it does not work with the table deletion.

@Suman Jagu: On what release did you have success?

Hi guys,
We have an RFC connection that is not working every time the ABAP system gets a system restart.
To resolve the issue, we need to restart the service which connects to the ABAP system.
just ask because I want to know if there is a fix for this so that we don't need to restart the service every time the ABAP system gets a system restart.
Hello Philip,
You have to check this with the Vertex team (i.e., why Vertex does not try to reconnect once it lost the connection due to the SAP restart).

Hello all,
I am trying to edit an extension field on OutboundDelivery.xbo in a piece of ABSL code.
The outbound delivery is released. After it is released a instance of a custom object is created via internal communications. In this instance the before save event is trigered where I have ABSL code and what I do here is:
1. use the ManageODin web service to cancel release of outbound delivery
2. try to edit 2 extension fields on the outbound delivery that I created
3. release outbound delivery again
This all looks okay, but the extension fields are never edited.
Not sure what I am doing wrong here it should by all logic be working.
When I debug line by line, and the outbound delivery release is canceled, if I hold the line in debugger I can literally go in the outbound delivery and manualy change and type in anything I want, but if it is changed inside ABSL code then nothing happens and I get message that data is read only - which is most certainly isnt. I even tried using the ManageODin Update action to update the two fields but again, nothing happens. Does anyone have any idea what I might be doing wrong here and how I can update fields on outbound delivery after it is released ?
Thank you 
ByDesign has a lot of hidden caching and buffering going on. From your own session's point of view your cancel operation was done by someone else and is thus not in its buffer. If you can't cancel the release inside your own session it won't work.
Hi Team,
I have a scenario in EWM as below as request to suggest me the same.
Steps-
1. Delivery D1 gets created via BAPI 'BAPI_GOODSMVT_CREATE', BAPI COMMIT - Movement type - 411K
2. For updating the backend table from IM to EWM , it takes sometime
3. Delivery D2 gets created via BAPI 'BAPI_GOODSMVT_CREATE', BAPI COMMIT - Movement type - 311
4. As the step 2 takes some time for the update , when step3 runs...it goes for an error stating stock unavailbility.
Is there an option to handle this case technically.
I have planned like below to follow some 2 step process...
1. Once D1 created , then D1 been updated in some custom table
2. Some reprocessing concept in selection screen, so that take D1 from custom table then do D2 document creation.
Is it fine if i go ahead with this model ?
Is the 311 dest is IM location?
Then you do these in EWM itself. First posting change and then adgi - move to im location.

You don't create anything on AL11. AL11 is a transaction that allows you to look at the file system of the application server. You have no requirement to "upload to AL11". You have a requirement to create an excel spreadsheet, with tabs, into the application server of the file system.

The reason for that is the secure by default principle. If security is configured (e.g. Spring security via cds-starter-cloudfoundry), all endpoints are authenticated. In case of mock configuration (no xsuaa or identity binding), the Java runtime automatically creates default mock users you can use.
In development scenarop you can also configure authentication to a more relaxed mode, e.g. only endpoints with authorizations (@restriction, @requires) are authenticated. See details here.

Dear experts,
I built an application before with AppGyver classic and integrated BTP destination pointing on S4 HANA Private system successfully. I also tried with SAP Build Apps with the same destination but it gave an error. 

I used the same exact configuration for the destination.
Just want to know, is there anything changing for the destination part?

Thanks for any clue,
Best regards,
Alex
Hi Alex
Had similar issue. I set on top also AppgyverEnabled = true and then it worked.

Hi All,
Is there a user exit (or similar) for displaying messages or pop up screens during customs declaration processing? I have a request from our business to display a certain prompt to the users who are processing the Import Declarations in certain scenarios. The message should appear either when a user tries to modify a particular field or prior to saving the declaration. Is this possible or is there any other option?
Thanks,
Gwyn
Hi Gwyn,
No, there's nothing like that in GTS.  But as a workaround, you could implement a new "Incompletion Procedure", to provide a warning or error about anything that needs to be, or shouldn't be, included in the Declaration.
Each Incompletion Procedure can (and usually does) call a Function Module, and that assignment is configurable.  Each incompletion module has the same interface ("signature"), so you can create your own module to first call the standard one for the Declaration, and then execute your own code to report the user's "errors".  If you code the mistakes to be errors, the user won't be able to submit the Declaration until they are corrected.
Perhaps you could consider that idea, before "hacking" the standard UI code?

I use FM HR_TMW_DB_UPDATE_TEVENT to delete records in TEVEN.
But this FM just set STOKZ (cancel indicator ) to X and not save the delete action into Log system ( That will be get from FM: HR_INFOTYPE_LOG_GET_LIST ).
But somehow, when I deleted a records in IT2011 in PA30, the deleted records show up in Log System and can archive from HR_INFOTYPE_LOG_GET_LIST.
How can i force HR_TMW_DB_UPDATE_TEVENT save delete log. Or do we have another FM to delete record in teven with Log.
Dear SAP Experts ,
I'm working on a business scenario where we are using line charts from SAP Vizcharts for data visualizations.
But we want the data-points to start from 0(initial).
Please consider the image below :

So to achieve our requirement we added a temporary row that has 0 as period

But in vizcharts the data-points are plotted from the center of the data-label, we want to achieve something like below

we want our analytical graphs to start from 0 and connect to rest of the data-points.
Request your support to know how we can achieve this requirement.
Thanks & RegardsRoystan D'silva
Hi Roystan D'silva,
VizCharts is no longer being maintained by SAP since a very early version of SAP UI5 (1.32).
https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/viz/demokit/VIZCharts.html
You could be using the following UI5 library instead:
(https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.viz.ui5.controls.VizFrame).
With that said, your second graph is showing the data point at 0,0. However, according to the documentation below, the Line Graph is supposed to show data values (Y-Axis) for a Data Series on (X-Axis) where the Data Series corresponds to a sequence collection such as: Years, Months, Dates, Periods, etc.:
https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/line-chart/
If you really think about this thoroughly It wouldn't make sense to have an integer value of zero for a series of dates like the ones you are using on your graph. After all, there is no date equals to zero, unless you consider it to be the start of the universe - preceding even the first day where human kind started counting the days :-). To make things easier to understand, think about a series of Months - there is no month 0, right?
Therefore, the reason for the displacement is "by design". It is shown to make room for data point labels. If you had a value for FirstQuarter, the library would need to have that room to display this label - even if you had it be drawn in a 45º angle. 
Since you don't have a lot of data for the available graph width, the graph shows a large displacement for the 0,0 data point. The larger the amount of data points you have on your graph, the smaller this displacement will be - but it will always be there.
Nevertheless, if you still think this is required for your graph, you could try to "minimize" this gap by adding more data points and setting the window starting point to be closer to zero so it causes the displacement to be kind of "hidden" (in fact it will only make the whole plot area be offset to the right, making the gap appear to be hidden on the left):
Dear Experts,
I am new to workflow.
I am triggering BUS2017 Event through BADI and using function module "SAP_WAPI_CREATE_EVENT"
As you can see there are event parameters of MSEG and MKPF in BUS2017 object.

When i pass the MKPF parameter through SWUE its working fine and parameter is passed.
But when using "SAP_WAPI_CREATE_EVENT" , as input container is element - value pair , I am unable to pass
MSEG and MKPF values there.
Can any one guide please how to pass structured or tabled type values in sap_wapi_create_event as parameter of event,
Hello Ahmed Ali
I did a little debugging for you. It looks like SAP_WAPI_CREATE_EVENT is not able to handle non-character like structures in event containers. The actual check is done in the CL_SWF_IO_SERVICES->CHECK_STRUCTURE method:
You can put a break-point there and check who it is handled in your call to SAP_WAPI_CREATE_EVENT_EXTENDED.
It's a shame though that this problem is not propagated back to SAP_WAPI_CREATE_EVENT log. 
At the same time you can create the event and specify its container in SWUE as SWUE does not use SAP_WAPI_CREATE_EVENT. The limitation comes from SAP_WAPI_CREATE_EVENT implementation, not from the event itself.
I guess you have the following options:
I would suggest the last approach.

Dear all,
currently, we are having issues with the updater instance that unexpectedly shutdowns. After restarting for some days it looks fine but then again shutdowns. 
We observed the following Fatal Error in the Updater:<br>#2.#2023 02 22 19:33:10:748#+0100#<strong>Fatal</strong>#/System/Network#
com.sap.SCC.infra.000021#IS-CC##C0000A8B045A03F20000001F00004038####<system>#######Thread[Socket[addr=abcdefghijkl/111.222.333.44,port=2100,localport=11549]-WRITE,5,main]#Plain##Connection with the remote client abcdefghijkl/111.222.333.44:2100 is closing because an error occurred with the socket network. Reason is: <strong>Broken pipe</strong>.#
We did a screening of all JVM Memory settings and were all according to the Note 2006073. The only parameter that we were not sure about was on the updater that it was -Xss256k
During the period of this Fatal error, there was no high load on the system and the CC is a mono-host system. 
We do not have a complicated charge logic and less than 10 counters in the charge plans. Any ideas, or suggestions would be welcomed.
Many thanks,
Doris
Hi Doris,
If the port number in the actual error log is 2100, then it seems that the connection is always broken while the updater is trying to write something to the dispatcher (because, by default, 2100 is the dispatcher's internal port, used to receive acknowledgements and miscellaneous queries from the other instances).So, can you check the dispatcher's logs/traces to see if a matching error appears around the time of the disconnections?Please also check if you have thread dumps generated automatically for the updater and the dispatcher. They might indicate if a particular problem cause the disconnections.
In some cases, connections may be forcibly closed by a network security mechanism (either because they've been open for too long, or because they've carried more bytes than the authorised limit).You may look into this, but we have no evidence that this is your issue now.
Also, can you check whether the other instances are similarly affected? This may be an indication too.
Finally, if it helps, you may enable the "NET" debug traces on the dispatcher and the updater until the issue occurs again (it's probably best to shut down the other instances during this test, to avoid getting too many illegible logs).
Best regards.

hi,
I have question. I setup production schedule into 3 shift with interval below.
Shift 1: 06:00:01 until 14:00:00
Shift 2: 14:00:01 until 22:00:00
Shift 3: 22:00:01 until 06:00:00
Why with above shift setup, if doing time confirmation worh CO11N at 00:00:01 until 05:59:59, end of execution time always taking 06:00:00 (end of shift 3). While other than that time, end of execution time will take current time.
Anyone encountered same problem? Is this sap standard? How to solve it?
Thanks.
Hi Experts, I have configured our ALM to connect to our DEV system and have imported the Test Automats from the S4 DEV System. I would like to know if it is possible to conect CALM to both DEV and QAS systems. 
Why ?
I would like to test on both DEV and QAS but different levels of maturity of test.
Test on DEV (Recorded Functional test) Req => US => Test Case.... then when successful release to transport to QAS. 
Once 1.n iterations have been transported i would like to do full scope item test in QAS.
Is this possible?

Hi experts
We currently have an issue now where the IDOC processing log cannot be found in an archived IDOC. 
We tried to find it by:
- viewing the archived IDOC via WE10, no luck.
- viewing the infostructure for the archived IDOC via SARI, no luck.
- viewing the Application log via SLG1 for NOT archived IDOCS, no luck (maybe we could then view the info structure for archived Application logs, BC_SBAL).
Maybe SAP has chosen not to archive the processing log together with the actual IDOC, and then just to delete the processing log during the archive process.
We would like to avoid retrieving the archived IDOCS to a seperate system because we never did that and don't know how to. And we are also not sure if the processing log then will be available. 
Does anyone have a soution/comment to this?

Thanks in advance.
Hello Patrick Bell SAHA OUATIO,
The logic/functionality of parked invoices is that first business user entered the invoice then manager/competent authority checked the invoice and post.
If you want to automate this system then instead of direct MIRO why you are parking the invoice?

You can plan for invoicing process on OpenText VIM and/or E-Invoicing Solution. For more refer blogs OpenText VIM and e-Invoicing

Hi Anthony,
from my view there are 2 scanarios. The item goes out by DelNote or Invoice.
This should work

Hello,
1) I added a business partner with the VAT number 1234567801.
2) I am adding a new business partner, the VAT number is 1234567801.
The warning message I want to see when I click the Save button: "There is a business partner with this VAT number. Do you want to save it anyway?"
Is something like this possible? By the way, I have the B1 Usability Package add-on.
Version: 10.0
Thanks!

Hi,
Check if the below is relevant for your reported case:

Hi,
This could be from B1UP addon. 
Right click on Unified VAT number field >>> B1 Usability Package >>> Edit B1 Validation Configurations. Check to see if it is set by any validation. Then you can inactive or remove.
Hope this helps,

How about this, Toolbox configuration?

Hello Guys.The requirement is to calculate separate tax on condition types like freight and others in a purchase order. (Tax % can be different than the tax % of the material). Also the amount of condition types is to be updated in their respective G/Ls.I have created condition types to calculate tax on Freight and others, and have assigned different G/Ls to different condition types in calculation schema. But in MIRO, only the amount of the purchased product and Tax on it is getting calculated and not the condition types. So while payment, the system is not taking the amount of condition types and their taxes.I tried to calculate the tax of condition types during MIRO, but the amount of condition types is not getting copied from PO. When I enter the amount in MIRO, the amount of Condition types is getting updated twice in G/L (From PO and from MIRO).Please suggest me a solution.

Hi,
I am running on ECC 6.0.
I understand that by ticking the Bal. sheet preparation checkbox in F.05:
1. It won't do reverse posting in the next period.
2. It will store the valuation difference in BSEG-BDIFF
But whether you tick or untick, the net accounting impact will be the same. It is just the presentation will be different.
So why exactly do we have this option? And why would someone tick the checkbox?
Any insight on this would be helpful.

Hello dear friends,
I am Jr Ps Consultant. I'm making a PS Budget Development Report for a client. My client wanted to see purchase request and purchase order as reserved budget in this report. I exported these fields as rmba+rmbe from rpsco table with prps objnr, that's correct. But they want to see the purchase request and purchase order documents that are registered in the reserved budget, and they want to go into the documents. I used f-02, Acdoca for Migo in my report. Please tell me from which fields of which table I can bring purchase requisition and purchase order documents to my report in this way. Since the build is progressing with Acdoca from the beginning, could you tell me how to fetch the correct tables and fields with Acdoca if any or not?
Please only people who can really help comment :)
Thank you.

Hello,
I am using Crystal Report 2020. I have an Excel file as the data source.
I create my crystal report template base on this document
https://www.sap.com/documents/2020/11/a046b61d-bd7d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html
I connect data source through :
OLE DB (ADO) --> Microsoft Office 12.0 Access Database Engine OLE DB Provider
I input information as follows :
Data Source: C:\DataQuery\Database\MonthlyBalance.xlsx
Office Database Type: Excel
User ID: Admin
Password: <NIL>
Jet System Database: <NIL>
Jet System Password: <NIL>
I created the crystal report template, the CR template can refresh the Excel data property.
The CR data source properties is as follows :
Provider: Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0
Data Source: C:\DataQuery\Database\MonthlyBalance.xlsx
User ID: Admin
Jet System Database: 
Office Database Type: Access
Use DSN Default Properties: False
Locale Identifier: 1033
OLE DB Services: -6
Extended Properties: Excel 12.0
I try the write my code by VB .NET to call the CR template and direct print to the printer (I do not need CR viewer in my requirement)
Imports CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine
Imports CrystalDecisions.ReportSource
Imports CrystalDecisions.Shared
..........
Dim cryRpt As New ReportDocument
cryRpt.Load("C:\DataQuery\MyCRTemplate.rpt")
cryRpt.PrintToPrinter(1, False, 0, 0)
The above code is running fine. The CR template can be called up and direct print to printer. But this is only the case of the CR template already saved with the data. The above code never refresh the latest data from the Excel data source.
I then add some more code as below (I also change the CR template to without saving data) : 
Dim cryRpt As New ReportDocument
cryRpt.Load("C:\DataQuery\MyCRTemplate.rpt")
cryRpt.SetDatabaseLogon("Admin", "", "C:\DataQuery\Database\MonthlyBalance.xlsx", "")
cryRpt.Refresh()
cryRpt.PrintToPrinter(1, False, 0, 0)
The PrintToPrinter statement shows with error --> CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine.LogOnException: 'Database logon failed.'
I try to change the CR data source connection from C:\DataQuery\Database\MonthlyBalance.xls to UNC name \\MyServer\DataQuery\Database\MonthlyBalance.xls. Also the same error -> 'Database logon failed.'
I try all above steps by connecting to an MS Access (.accdb) data file instead of an Excel. Also modify the code as below :
cryRpt.SetDatabaseLogon("Admin", "", "C:\DataQuery\Database\MonthlyBalance.accdb", "")
I code runs with the same problem -> 'Database logon failed.'
I have the following installed : 
Crystal Report 2020 full version + SP3
Visual Studio 2022 
CR for VS 2022 SP33
CR for VS 2022 runtime engine for .NET framework MSI (64-bit) 
AccessDatabaseEngine_X64.exe
Would be appreciated if some export could indicate me how the code SetDatabaseLogon can logon to the Excel data source and refresh the CR property.
Hi Sylvian,
You did not read that document close enough.
Firstly, Access database driver is NOT the same as the Excel driver so that's not going to work.
In CR Designer the how to doc tells you you need to the use the Office 2010 runtime and not the one you are using.
Also note you can't use the XLSX file type, it has to be saved as a XLS file:
.XLSX Format
SAP Crystal Reports will not connect directly to an .XLSX workbook. And, no default support for .XLSX format
is provided via other “out of the box” connectivity methods (ODBC, OLE DB, and so forth). Two options exist if
the Excel workbook you wish to report from is in .XLSX format:
• Open the workbook in a later version of Microsoft Excel and export the workbook to .XLS format.
• Install the Microsoft Access database engine 2010 Redistributable driver. This will add an .XLSX driver to
your computer. You may then connect using an included OLE DB driver or create a standard ODBC data
source directly from the .XLSX file.
Read more about how to on page 3.
Also read more about what CR for VS does support on the Platforms guide:
https://www.sap.com/documents/2016/06/f871031e-757c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html
You are trying to connect apples to oranges, not going to work...
Also, if the data source is not the same as when the report was created you may need to use ReplaceCOnnection() API to update the reports data source. Search using Google for that API, there is a KBA on how to use it.

Hi gurus,
I'm trying to upgrade our old SAP B1 HANA environment from 9.3 PL04 to PL10. But the System Components is still in PL04 after upgrading. Also when starting the upgrading, there's no action marked for the System Component feature. Is there any steps I missed?

Hello All, 
I just start block tag on SAP DM ST2000, and faced multiple Continuation chain element Issues in my validation Excel File. 
The error message is the following one : [ix11.4.1.2:continuationChainNested] Inline XBRL continuation chain element contp111378 has descendant element contp112720 - XX-2022-12-31AR.xhtml
Do you know if it is a blocking control for filling to AMF (French Market Regulator), and have any idea / documentation on how to solve these issues ? 
Thanks a lot for your help ! 
BR
Hello BERTRAND LAROCHE 
This means that the iXBRL generated by DM is not syntactically valid
See: https://www.xbrl.org/specification/inlinexbrl-part1/rec-2013-11-18/inlinexbrl-part1-rec-2013-11-18.html
11.1.2 Validation rules
The {continuation chain} property MUST NOT contain any element which is a descendant of any other element in the {continuation chain} property.
So, in this case the ix11.4.1.2 number is not some ESMA rule, but an iXBRL validation rule.
I suggest you open a Support case, so that we can get your files etc.
This issue would definitely be blocking for AMF

The reason for this error is nested tagging of the same context.
For example: you tag the entire page 1 with concept A and also the first paragraph of page 1 with the same concept. This is a nested tagging which is not allowed.

Guido
Hello Guido,

Hi, 
is it possible to connect to non-SAP Event Broker from SAP Subscription Billing? For example Solace PubSub+. In the Integration configuration screen on SAP Subscription Billing side there is only SAP Event Mesh config possible.
BR, Piotr 
SAP particularly made it no possible to integrate directly with other messaging services. At this time, Event Mesh seems to be the only possibility. From there you could connect other event brokers.

下午好。
我们财务在审查的过程中发现，2022年有两个借项凭证的单据的客户错配了。而且这两张借项凭证已经开票了。请问，现在还可以冲销掉发票吗？
如果可以，是在原开票日期冲销还是就冲销到本期？
还望不吝解惑。
客户您好，
请问是什么类型的单据，由哪个app post的，如果可以的话麻烦提供下截图并表明哪里错配了，谢谢。

您好，
SD这边当然是可以取消发票的，只是需要注意对FI的影响，这方面还是需要咨询FI的专家。

Hi experts,
I have looked at the documents [wiki] about how to tag block text in Word.
However, I have a few questions.

I select text in Word , which I want to tag on two pages in sequence. My document also contains text in the header and footer. After tagging these two pages, I also see the text from the header and footer in the tagging preview ( Fact value). Can this be eliminated in SAP DM so that the tag does not contain the text from the header and footer?
Where can I find and assign the @escaped attribute to the tagged text in SAP DM? The attribute is referred to in the new ESEF Reporting Manual [Guidance 2.2.6] Technical constructions of a block tag [last updated: July 2022].[new].

Regards, Iwona 
Hi  Iwona Olszewska 
1. Is a bug - will be fixed in Stack 2000
2. Discussed this with our developers recently. So far, we have not seen any validation failures even if this 'escape="true" ' is not included.
So,
<ix:nonNumeric name="ifrs-full:DisclosureExplanatory" contextRef="CYTD" id="Tag1" escape="true">
<ix:nonNumeric name="ifrs-full:DisclosureExplanatory" contextRef="CYTD" id="Tag1" >

...are both valid.

Did you get any validation issues or comments from the regulator about this?

Marc
Hello experts,
Auditors use a tool called Beacon to test the Istance produced by SAP DM and did highlited this as a blocking error. In particular referring to some special charaters such as Angle Brackets, ampersands,
We have tested on the italian regulator and we did not get any validation issue.
Is there any workaround for these cases?
Many thanks
Giuseppe
Dear experts,
I can't understand the purpose of cost center profit analysis attributes and project profit analysis attributes
For Ex. What is the purpose of defining a customer group or a product category in cost center profit analysis attributes so when I make a transaction on this cost center (for ex. Finance), this transaction will be shown in the profit analysis reports (ex. Profit detail by contribution margin) when I filter by the previous customer group or or product category. What is the relation between the cost center (finance) and this customer group or this product category? I think that will mislead the information  can anybody make me understand this point better ?
Dear Mostafa,
don't care, you are not the onyl one who is gathering about this option. But in 10 years I didn't meet anyone in the ByD-community who was able to explain the intention of this option. Obviously, this must be one of ByD's most kept secrets.
I would also be glad if someone could describe a use case which he/she managed by these settings.

Hello everyone,
I am using the KPI generation procedures for HANA anonymization which are in-built.
The syntax is: 
CALL GET_ANONYMIZATION_VIEW_STATISTICS('get_values', NULL, '<Schema>', '<Anonymization_view>');
Can I somehow store the results inside a table or view for persistence or future modifications? 
This built-in procedure is not allowing me to edit it and add an output variable. 
Kindly help if I am missing something
Yes, you can store the results of the KPI generation procedure in a table or view. To do this, you can use the INSERT INTO statement to insert the data into a table or view. For example:



This statement will store the results of the KPI generation procedure in the MyResultsTable table. You can then use this table to view, modify, or analyze the results of the KPI generation procedure.
Hi all,
I have a planning model where I enabled company code and profit centre as data access control.
I maintained my user name for some of the members on these dimension and I am not able to read / write data to all company codes / profit centres as expected - it is throwing error when I try to publish it or it is not showing me the existing data.However I still see all of the company codes and profit centres in a planning story filter because unbooked members is selected in the story. I see in this note that it is by design as data access control limits the data at fact table level but not dimension level.
https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2423166

on the other hand, I see there is a workaround below . I indeed want users to be able to see a company code in story filter only if they have read or write access for it.
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/00f68c2e08b941f081002fd3691d86a7/b46f2f74aea04c399ccb5c9b1bcc225e.html?locale=en-US

However, when I enable hide parents in profit centre dimension as given in above, my hierarchical view is broken and I don't see members that I am authorized. Is this option working as expected? Can I limit users' access in a planning story so that they see members only if they have read or write access to?
If you switch on hide parent, you should still able to see member you have access to , but not it's parent which you don't have access to. Probably you can upload screenshot of your DAC setting and your story view.  
Hi William,
This is the read/write on profit centre, ( filtered out other irrelevant members )

My user belongs FINANCIAL_PLANNER_PUBL so I have write access. Everything works as expected, in terms of publishing data, I am able to publish only those profit centres.This proves that my user is not included in other memberrs of the profit centre mistakenly even as read only because I am not able to see data from other profit centres either.
This is the story view before I enable "hide parents" on profit centre dimension. I see all levels of the hierarchy of all members but only plan / publish those members above that I am authroized. But I see all the levels of the hierarchy still as selectable as said because there is no restriction on story filter and unbooked members also selected since this is a planning story

Now I am enabling hide parent members view, 

opening this story again after logging off with the same user
This time it starts with a warning message

When I hit the filter, I see below profit centres only which are all indeed level 2 members and not base levels even. And the view is flat, hierarchy view is broken.

In the story filter, we selected Level 2 members 1 by 1 including the PUBLISHING member above as well(which is the only level 2 member which the user has authorization ) I was expecting it shows me only this Level 2 node along with its child members as far as I understand from the setting explanation on help.sap.com below link but only level 2 node is shown (withouth base level child members )and even other level 2 members which I doon't have access to also visible. 
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/00f68c2e08b941f081002fd3691d86a7/b46f2f74aea04c399ccb5c9b1bcc225e.html?locale=en-US
Anyone has any idea?

Hello Guys
Greetings for the day!
I am facing issue for our client wherein after completing the payment run in F110, only 1 approver is reflecting for BCM batch for 1st approver and 2nd approver. There are more than 1 approvers at both level however system is showing only 1 random approver. All necessary configuration seems to be in place. When I go to SWIA transaction and select that particular batch after giving TASK and select option as Replace Manually then system is assigning all approvers to the batch.
It would be really great if you can assist in knowing the rationale for this since manual allocation is not efficient each time. All the approvers should reflect automatically in BNK_MONI

Hi Jos,
did you have a look at the 2302 Release News? There was a slide about "SAP Companion" (SAP Enable Now). 
Maybe that would be a way to go for you to provide some In-App-Help for your users.
Here you can find the link to the What's New Webcast
And here you can find some information about the integration of SAP Companion with SAP Marketing Cloud
Never used it myself before but for me it sounds a little bit like what you need.
BR Tobias
Hi Jos Verberne,
No, adding a custom tile (with any simple link or a pdf/ announcement link) is not possible in the SAP Cloud Applications as you're not given the Dev role.
I hope this information was helpful in closing this thread. 
Thank you.

Somehow found that user created duplicate entry in tender custom table ZTD_EV001 and later deleted it. So now the custom tender table ZTD_EV001 have 2 entries now, 1 still in process and another with the status deleted.
But found that the standard workflow table SWWWIHEAD record creation date seemed mixed up. The record creation date seems to tally with the deleted ZTD_EV001 creation date instead of the still in process tender.
So I debug change the SWWWIHEAD standard table record creation date to match that with the still in process ZTD_EV001 tender creation date.
The corresponding workflow record can be retrieved now.
Hi 
if the problem has been fixed can you close the  request

Hello,
I have exposed a nodejs service in my CAP application and now I need access in external ui5 app (not included in mta of CAP app). The service restricted with 'authenticated-user' is working well, but when the service is restricted with a role I have no access and still 403 error. I am using client_id and client_secret from xsuaa instance of CAP app.
The roles are assigned in BTP.
How can I get access to the secured service?
Thanks in advance for your help.
screens from service.cds file
'authenticated-user' - READ works good

role restricted - need help

I would suggest that you use a destination with Authentication OAuth2UserTokenExchange. That way you can keep your XSUAA instances separate but let a user who has the correct roles assigned for your CAP backend being able to use it.

HI All,
I am Struggling to Map a Scenario of sample consumption / Scrap via the inspection lot for the Embedded EWM,
Can anyone please help me on that detailed step by step procedure.
1 -- i have a few questions as well, for the scenario how is the cost center determined for the Scrapping / Sample consumption posted via the EWM
2 -- Is the Stock in EWM knocked off from the EWM system and visible in the inventory books like the scenario in Inventory managed materials. Wat are the reports from which the Material which are posted to scrap can be viewed
Thanks and Regards,
Abhishek Parab.
Hi Parab,
I had the same need, I made the necessary settings in ewm and QM, however I didn't get any movement generated when saving, I don't see what is missing, could you tell me if you have found a solution?
Thanks

Hi,
 
 
 
Is there any transaction to list all planned/unplanned materials as MD07 and total all requirements similar to MD04. This would be useful when we make our production plan with MD61. Thanks.
Hi Kiran,
There is no such transaction code to give all information at several materials in a single view.
The only option is to run the specific transaction codes based on requirements and receipts wise. Usually, we use COOIS production order information system to check the planned and production orders ME5A and ME2N for purchasing and VA05 for sales orders.
You can build the custom report based on requirement.
Best Regards,
Lingaiah
You can use RMMD07NEW / RMMD07NEW report to access MD07 / MD06 list for several materials via flexible selection criteria.
Hello
What do you mean planned/unplanned materials?
In S/4HANA we have new MRP fiori apps, which will show you for example, an overview of materials with shortages, shortages for sales orders or for reservations.

Caetano

The error message suggests that there is an issue with your network connectivity. As you also noticed, the npm registry URL in the error message points to an internal SAP registry, which might require additional authentication or configuration.
You can try using another npm registry by setting the registry URL to a public registry, such as the official npm registry:
After making these changes, try running the npm i -g @sap/cds-lsp command again and see if it works.
Unfortunately, there was a problem when shrinkwrapping the component.
You could try to manual install it like so (for *nix like systems) OR just stay on previous version e.g. 6.3.0:
1. install `@sap/cds-lsp` from _npmjs.org_ into subfolder `cds-lsp` 
```#!/bin/bashcomponentName=cds-lspfullName="@sap/$componentName"echo '=== Getting latest download URL'url=$(npm view $fullName | sed -n 's/.tarball.*\(https.*\)$/\1/p')echo "=== Downloading $url" \curl -O $urlfilename=$(echo $url | sed -n 's/.*\/\(.*\)$/\1/p')echo "=== Extracting $filename"tar xfv $filenamemv package $componentNameecho "=== Removing $filename"rm $filenamecd $componentNamerm npm-shrinkwrap.jsonecho "=== Installing dependencies"npm i```

Hi,
We are using the 360 feedback form. When a person selects participants and sents out the forms, he/she can add a comment that is sent in the mail to the participants. When later adding a participant, we see no possibility to add a comment. Also the previous comment is not taken into account. Is there a way to get a comment also in the mail to later added people?

1 ) IBP for MRO - What is new in 2302 release upgrade ?
We are trying to go for MRO using IBP system.
2 ) I do not see much of knowledge resources related to Master Data, Key Figure data load process.
3 ) Is it possible to get some sample data to check/test how MRO functionality works as proof of concept ?
4 ) Where can I find IBP MRO Sample data ?
Thanks.
Hi Chakravarthi Vana,
The new functionality of IBP MRO was released in 2202 and enhancements for IO & Demand in 2205 and 2208. Whereas in 2211 and 2302 no new major releases.
SAP is currently working for sample planning area for IBP MRO, it is in the roadmap. Mostly after availability of this sample PA, technical assets for MRO will be published in Rapid.
Regards,
PJ
Hi PRAVEEN Jadhav
Thanks for your reply.
1 ) Sample Planning Area for MRO in IBP is given in 2205 or 2202 release.
I have got it from the internet.
2 ) To Run or execute basic cycle of MRO scenario/functionality in IBP system, 
I would like to understand about - in what sequence the Data should be loaded into the Sample Planning Area ?
a ) After uploading the Sample Planning Area which is provided in 2205/2202, Do we need to do any configuration settings or any other settings do we need to do before loading Master Data into the Sample Planning Area ?
b ) Master Data
Before loading Master Data, do we need to load any other data or any steps/Activities we need to do ?
c ) Task Lists related data or Transactions related data or Orders related data.
In what sequence do we need to load Task Lists related data or Transactions related data or Orders related data ?
d ) After loading the Master Data and Transaction data, are there any other Steps or Activities do we need to perform before executing the jobs or operators ?
3 ) Please let me know where can I find some documents or Notes on how the MRO scenario/functionality in IBP system can be executed and check the results to analyze the output data using MRO functionality ?
Appreciate your inputs.
Thanks in advance.
Hello,
I have done a lot in B1IF Version 1. Now i have started to develop in B1IF Version 2.0.
Appart of technical advantages and disadvantages, the development in Version 1 is much faster and easier because of the development mode and the possibility, that I can VERY QUICKLY just test a scenario step - I click test and run and can open the debugger.
In Version 2 I have to save the scenario step, then switch to the test deployments tab, "redeploy" the step - i have to wait for example 20 seconds, then test. This is very slowly, lot of waiting time.
Can you confirm this? What is your best practice of developing in Version2 (in comparison to Version 1)?
Hi dear experts, 
I haven't found an option to copy the whole project, is there any? 
I need to create the separate project with some minor changes but the rest should be the same as there is another target group and to be able to track the test execution in separate ways. 
Does anyone know how to do this? Maybe download and upload? There is no "copy" function. 
This would help us!!
Thanks!!

Hello Experts,
I am getting a very random error for our SVT rules, it is haphazard not happening every time, but unable to point out exactly what the issue is. Please suggest if any of you have faced this error before. We have tried re-registering twice in Expert Admin, error still exists.

Hello,
So this is my code:for i in range (session.FindById("wnd[1]/usr/cntlGRID1/shellcont/shell").RowCount -1): if session.FindById("wnd[1]/usr/cntlGRID1/shellcont/shell[0,i]").Text == "ESZ kísérőlevél": 
 session.FindById("wnd[1]/usr/cntlGRID1/shellcont/shell").GetAbsoluteRow(i).Selected = True
and this grid:

And I want to select the line where the "ESZ kísérőlevél" appears.
I didn't really realize what I messed up. Any ideas?

I tried to get a number pattern from a string in cloud studio. I used match function with regex but it returning null value. 
Step1.myVariable.match('/(\d{10})\s+(\d+)/g')

//my string is "1234567890 12 dfds 345". Regex should find and return "1234567890 12"
Did I miss anything?
How to use Regex in SAP iRPA?
Hi Ranjith Kumar,
Are you trying to extract data from PDF. If so, you could use the following blog to extract the data you are looking for by using the PDF Extraction SDK:
https://blogs.sap.com/2020/05/12/how-to-extract-data-from-text-searchable-pdf-documents-in-sap-intelligent-robotic-process-automation/
You can also test the regular expression online here:
https://regex101.com/
I've used the expression from the blog and it works with Orders Numbers that contain alphanumeric characters.

So, if your end-result should be: "1234567890 12" then your Regex could be something like: "/(\d{10}\s+\d+)/"

Best regards,Ivan

Hi Jana De Klerk ,
Without Quotes its throwing error in SAP Build environment(cloud studio) only. It working fine in JS without quote.

Hello please suggest a website if you have a link to practice ABAP online with step by step tutorial like exercism.org except sap learning hub.Thank you 
ABAP Editor - The First Web Based ABAP Editor
Just find some basic tasks and try this one! Good luck! 
Sorry, there is nothing else. Until recently, even exercism did not exist for ABAP.
In general, I'd suggest to keep low expectations with regards to ABAP learning material availability because it's SAP proprietary language and not something like C or Java that can be used by anyone and therefore much more content gets created.
Good luck. You'll need it.

请问，如果对一个物料做202入库100kg，然后做一个标准退货采购订单退100kg，在做一个委外采购订单采购100kg，再做一个201消耗100kg（或者对最开始的202的凭证做冲销）。标准退货采购订单你和委外采购订单的价格一致。
请问，在财务上是否有什么影响？比如：会有采购差异？等等其它。
望不吝解惑。
差异一般是因为手动输入，价格变化，或者汇率变化产生的。
财务上面如果发生过过账肯定会有记录的。
Hi 您好，
SAP讲究账实相符，从您描述来看，逻辑是反的，这么做是满足那种业务需求呢？

Hi,
Today I've run the BPA primer tutorial. Everything works fine until it comes to the release and deployment of the sales order process. After clicking the Form Link, I'm getting the following error message
Oops something went wrong!
Form Descriptor failed to load: Forbidden (FORM_RUNTIME_ERR_ART)
That's not a very helpful message for debugging in a primer tutorial ;-) I don't have any error, warning or info messages in the Deployment Console. During deployment, I was asked to enter run variables or triggers which is not mentioned 
on the course page. 
Any idea is kindly appreciated.

Hello SAP Community,
I was wondering if we can create and set multiple custom dunning forms (based on pre-delivered dunning letter form) per the dunning level we set (e.g., different dunning forms for 75, 90, and 120 days).
The reason our team needs to set up multiple ones is the client has different dunning letters with different verbiage.
Any help will be greatly appreciated :)
Thank you,Tack
Hi,
Good day!
I request you to refer J59 scope item under preliminary steps and below blog for more information.

Hi Tack,
You can create as many dunning forms as you want. With configuring app 'Output Parameter Determination' (OPD) you decide which one is taken. The first suitable form which is found will be taken.

Hi,

I have a list of 2000 queries wanted to know particular infoobject is present in Free characteristic or in row of query ,pls provide me some tips how i can find it.
I have tried using table
RSZSELECT
RSZELTDIR
RSZELTXREF
RSRREPDIR

With smart use of above table i can find out whether infoobject is used in query or not, but still no success in finding whether infoobject is present in Free Characteristic or in Row , i don't want to sit and open one query at a time in query designer or in metadata to find these details.
 
 
Regards,
Ajit Mishra.
you can check the code behind transaction RSRTQ... 
Hi Ajit ,

Please check RSRTQ once . You may get what you need here.

Hi Ajit,

I also have an similar requirement & found the following way.

Table RSZSELECT will provide the required information.

Filter on the field IOBJNM for the list of infoobjects & SOTP will specify the corresponding information of free-characteristic or Default Filter.

We need to perform Intra Company matching to remove records mainly reversed transactions. In ICMR we created a data source with leading and partner unit field as "Company". This allowed us to use a second data source which we used for Intra company matching for reversed documents. But there is a problem. These reversed documents still appear in our other matching methods with proc status as "00" despite being matched in the Intra co match method.
SAP claims this is standard behaviour. Then How do we have 1 common method for INTRA and Inter company matching??
Hi Ram Bharadwaj, Matching method defines a data scope. The document items can be included in multiple methods and their processing status is method-dependent. For intercompany and intracompany document matching, the best practice is you have separate matching methods and define a reasonable scope (by using method-level filters) that includes only the relevant items. The reconciliation case (assigned to the method) can further narrow down scope by using display groups for the reporting usage (reconciliation overview and balances reports).

Dear Community,
with the Post Currency Adjustments Fiori App F1606 in General Ledger J58 it is possible to post manual currency adjustments to adjust account balances in foreign currencies. 
1. For which use cases in everyday customer life is this manual booking process required?
2.  Why should we use this manual posting?
3. Compared to normal Foreign Currency Valuation or FX Valuation with activated Advanced Valuation?
I would be very happy to hear about your use cases or experiences with this app.
Many thanks,
 Mara
See help.sap.com documentation on app Post Currency AdjustmentsYou use this app to make adjustments to account balances in one or more currencies. The app is useful for example in environments with volatile exchange rates. You adjust the account balances by entering amounts for specific currencies directly.

Hi Malipeddi,
Yes you can use this API to post any JE item from an external third party application. Make sure third party application has all the master data and values required to do the posting and also consider that you will need to do the clearings as well after posting has been processed. I understand this postings are accounts receivables related from you mention of collection entry.

Hi experts,
I need to automatically filter a virtual table to load data from the current and previous day. For this I have programmed a StoreProcedure that looks like this.

PROCEDURE "SCHEMA.db.business.SP::SP_ZVBFA_F"(OUT OPT VT_Z_VBFA_F )
   LANGUAGE SQLSCRIPT
   SQL SECURITY INVOKER
   --DEFAULT SCHEMA <default_schema_name>
   READS SQL DATA AS
BEGIN
  OPT = SELECT * FROM "VT_Z_VBFA_F" AS VT
WHERE TO_DATE(CONCAT(SUBSTRING("ERDAT",1,4),CONCAT('-',CONCAT(SUBSTRING("ERDAT",5,2),CONCAT('-',SUBSTRING("ERDAT",7,2))))),'YYYY-MM-DD') >= ADD_DAYS(CURRENT_UTCDATE,-1) 
and TO_DATE(CONCAT(SUBSTRING("ERDAT",1,4),CONCAT('-',CONCAT(SUBSTRING("ERDAT",5,2),CONCAT('-',SUBSTRING("ERDAT",7,2))))),'YYYY-MM-DD') <= CURRENT_UTCDATE  
;END

Subsequently, I put this SP in a node of a FlowGraph. I build the SP, and after I execute the FlowGraph but the execution is canceled after 1 hour.
i would like to know if Hana Cloud does or does not allow this type of executions or if I am doing something wrong.

I want to create a journal entry workflow.
The first would be: if the submitter is a financial analyst (only a specific employee), every journal entry sould be approve by the controller.

For the first step, I'm not able to do it. I see that in Manage Teams and responsibilities I can add the submitter, but I want to restrict the step to a user, not juste the recipient. Is it possible?

各专家们：
下午好。
我们在和委外供应商对账时发现，系统中O库存有3000kg，实际已经没有组件存放在供应商处。经过查血发现，最初创建的委外采购订单产品A是4000kg，发组件发了4000kg，后来供应商生产过程中只有1000kg的A产出，其它的产出都是低一等级的A1。所以，采购员更改采购订单，将A的数量更改为1000kg，同时，增添了A1的采购订单项目，但是，该项目并没有维护成委外类型。导致收货A1的时候没有扣减组件。
这个业务发生在2022年11月。当前，系统中A1的库存也不够3000kg。
请问：应该如何更正此项错误？
是否可以用202先退3000kg的A1库存到本月，然后创建退货的采购订单退3000kg，然后创建委外采购订单3000kg，收货扣减组件，然后再用201消耗3000kg。
你好，
当时收货A1时候，实物有3000KG吗。根据您的描述，目前系统中A1没有3000KG，是因为当时委外收货的时候就不到3000KG还是当时收货有3000KG，但是后面有所消耗。
您提到的这个方式，从物料数量的角度是可以的，但是需要和客户公司的财务确认一下，有没有内部管理等问题。
是的，和公司内部财务要先确认好。不过最好是从流程后端冲销，如果销售端所有都做完了，不太可能冲销了，可以从物料移动的层面去处理这种异常。

Hi Michael,
Is the IdM installation already based on Oracle? If so, you could just install an IdM in the target environment and do backup and restore of the DB. Only consideration is to not forget about the Keys.ini file, which you also need to transport from old to new system manually after installation.

It is recognized that in table "TB004", we can check the optional and mandatory status of each item by BP type.
However, is it not possible to check the status of each item?
How can we check the status of the following evidences as the status of each item?

Hiroshi MoriThe best way to check the status of the evidence for each item is to look up the requirements for the particular BP type in the BP documentation. The BP documentation will contain a list of the required and optional items for the given BP type. This list will include information on the status of each item, such as whether it is mandatory or optional.

Dear SAP Expert,
Our client is requiring that: 
· To fix the exchange rate on large projects on the starting dates of projects; instead of using the exchange rate defined and changed by finance team (for example, on the app Currency Exchange Rate).
· Then the exchange rate be fixed all along the project execution phase. The exchange rate fixed also on committed cost.
· A user-friendly business process should be expected and implemented.
Could you please indicate me that the standard SAP Cloud if can cover this requirement?
Many thanks for your support!

You can fix exchange rate from purchase order which are assigned to WBS/Project. You can fix the exchange rate indicator at header level   from Purchase order and also you can enter exchange rate manually from financial transaction posted from finance side.

How to do currency conversion for future dates if that particular exchange rate is not available in xrt table
The best way to do currency conversion for future dates is to use the forecasted exchange rate. This can be either based on historical trends or market forecasts. It is also possible to use vendor provided forecasts to do currency conversion in SAP S/4 Cloud.
Hello R Mk,
If no rate/value defined for future date then how the system do currency conversion. Hence it's not feasible if no value defined for future dates.

Hello everyone,
My client wants to use a different G/L account for his asset supplier and to do that we wanted to use the vendor investment configuration available in tcode OBBX in S/4Hana OP. We would like to configure "INH" and "INS" operations keys but can't find them in the automatic account determination in S/4Hana Cloud.
For your information, our client's supplier can be a "goods supplier" and "asset supplier" at the same time and those two don't use the same G/L account. We can't create the supplier twice because of his government identification which can't exist twice in SAP. 
Do we have to activate a specific scope item ? Do you have any input ?
Thanks for your help.

Hi Hawa,
In order to achieve your requirement, you can use 'Alternative Reconciliation Account' functionality.
4 Steps to be done:
1. GL Master: Mark your reconciliation G/L as "Recon. acct ready for input"
2. Business Partner: Update any reconciliation (best suited) GL in Business Partner (Vendor)
3. Config: Reconciliation and Alternative GL. SSCUI: Define Alternative Reconciliation Accounts (102631)
4. Invoice posting: During Invoice posting (Invoice Verification) you can change the recon G/L as per your requirement.

Hi Hawa,
It shall work for MIRO also in the standard without any additional settings.
First of all you shall be be able to see the reconciliation gl and it shall be in change mode. Please check the reconciliation gl that is coming jn MIRO if all relevant setting are there or not.
Please also check if there is additional settings for MIRO like screen variant or something which is stopping this for you.
Ideally it shall work for MIRO as well.

Hello experts,

Fields Document header text (BKPF-BKTXT), Reference (BKPF-XBLNR) and Assignment (BSEG-ZUONR) are filled with combination of data from tables FEBKO and FEBEP. My question is if it is possible to change logic how the mentioned fields are filled. I would like to change Document header text (BKPF-BKTXT) for a specific value from Note to payee (FEBRE-VWEZW). Is there any extensibility for this on S/4HANA Public cloud?

Hi All
After executing the initialization, i am getting the following error when i hit the url http://localhost:9001/store
org.springframework.web.util.NestedServletException: Error while processing internal filterchain. Exception occurred at chain position: 4 of 16. Current filter: 'en.capgemini.klarets.storefront.filters.cms.CMSSiteFilter@5763bd83'!; nested exception is de.hybris.platform.basecommerce.exceptions.BaseSiteActivationException: de.hybris.platform.cms2.exceptions.CMSItemNotFoundException: Catalog [CatalogModel (8796093219416)] is not part of current site [klarets] de.hybris.platform.servicelayer.web.AbstractPlatformFilterChain$InternalFilterChain.doFilter(AbstractPlatformFilterChain.java:233)
I am using hybris-commerce-suite-5.0.0.3
Well the solution is, i need to map the productCatalog to the store inside hmc but why is it not getting mapped via impex file. There is no error when i run the hybris initialization.
Am i missing something here....
Regards 
Could it be that the impex is not fully correct and it can not find the store where to import the catalogs? Because i assume this is the way you do it. How does you impex look like? 
Thanks Marko.
That's exactly what i am looking out for, which is the impex file that has the store and product catalog mapping. If i can get that info, i can dig the issue further.
Search for a file called site.impex There you might find what you are looking for. Otherwise you can try to find any impex containing something like this: INSERT_UPDATE CMSSite 
Hi Marko 
This is the content of site.impex
$storePrefix=klarets
$productCatalog=$storePrefixProductCatalog $contentCatalog=$storePrefixContentCatalog $contentCV=catalogVersion(CatalogVersion.catalog(Catalog.id[default=$contentCatalog]),CatalogVersion.version[default=Staged])[default=$contentCatalog:Staged] $defaultLanguage=en $storeUid=$storePrefix $siteUid=$storePrefix $webServiceSiteUid=$siteUidWS

i checked with apparels and electronics site.impex files and they both look similar. I reran the Initialization but the productCatalog did not map to the base store. 
Could it be that this impex is not executed at all? not correctly setup in SystemSetup? If you instead execute this impex in HAC , does it then set it up correctly? 
Thanks Marko, let me check it out. 
Hi Makarand ,
Did you get any solution for this, I am facing the same issue.
Regards, Manish 
Is this issue is resolved ? I am facing similar issue, would appreciate for solution. 
Thanks, 

Hi All, I had same issue and figured out that the impex are not loaded at all. The "CreateProjectData" method in InitialDataSystemSetup.java should be modified as shown below. 
//Add import data for each site you have configured
 } 
Please note that MYSTORE is the same value that you had mentioned in .impex for the $storePrefix. 
Thanks, Srujana. 
Could it be that the impex is not completely correct and cannot locate the store from which to import the catalogues ? Because I'm assuming this is how you do it. How does your impex look?
I am wanting to identify the value of "Delivered" in the OINV table, but I am not able to identify it, in this case it is to be able to differentiate those reservation invoices copied to deliveries

Dear team,
In SAP Cloud, for Project module, we use app “Import Financial Data” to import the planned cost and budget for the WBS elements. Do you have any other way to post the cost and budget?
If the planned cost amount been changed time to time, how should we do? Can we adjust (update) the amount based on the first importing? Or shall we re-import the new amount to cover the previous one? 
Our client has the cost or budget plan with different versions, such as: Orig Estimate/ Latest Estimat/ Current Forecast. Is there any report or app existing to display all the versions of cost or budget updated?
Looking forward to hearing from you
Best regards,
 Hong DUCRUET
Dear  Hong Ducruet,
when importing your data via the Import Financial Plan Data app there is no versioning possible.The app is overwriting the data on the data base depending on the delete scope you set in the upload file.
For details regarding the Import Financial Plan Data app, see:SAP S/4HANA CloudSAP S/4HANA
If you want to have a versioning, then you need to create custom categories and upload your data to those custom categories.
For example:
In this way you won't overwrite the uploaded data from the previous planning cycles.To compare those categories you need to create a custom report using the Custom Analytical Queries app. You can copy an existing query and modify it with the app.
For details regarding the Custom Analytical Queries app, see:SAP S/4HANA CloudSAP S/4HANA
List of available Plan Categories (like PLN) are available via system configuration setting "Maintain Category for Planning", new categories like "Current Forecast" can be defined there and later used via file upload "Import Financial Plan Data", provided "Import Allowed" setting is active. See below for details on upload logic.

Hello Frank,
I am trying to create a new category "Current Forecast" in CSC; but it seems that the new entry cannot be created, with the message that " No input help is available":

Also, I do not think I get the main point: even I create the new category as "Current Forecast", the data latest imported will overwrite the previous importing; same as using the PLN category. 
My concern is: how to get the data from SAP: Orig Estimate (version 1 imported by PLN, e.g., September) / Latest Estimat (version 2 imported by PLN, e.g., October)/ Current Forecast (current version imported by PLN, e.g., Today). 
=> because the customer wants to compare the different version of planned cost.
is there any reporting can extract those data directly from SAP (without any development)?
Thank you very much in advance for your support 
Warm regards

Hi Hong,
You can check SSCUI 101970 Maintain Category for Planning

No manual postings should be done on GR/IR accounts. 
See KBA 3094021 - Manual Posting should not be done on GR/IR Clearing Account.
Could you please also see if the job template called "Analyze GR/IR Clearing Accounts and Display Acquisition Tax" a solution for your issue(the app name is called "Schedule General Ledger Jobs") ?

Hello,
We're using flexible workflow for Supplier Invoices and wondering how others are handling invoices with posting dates in prior periods that are approved after that period is closed. This is a very common occurrence for us (particularly with invoices entered in the last few days of a month), and the system behavior we'd like to occur is that the posting date is adjusted automatically to the current period when approved and posted (basically Posting Date = Approval Date). 
Is there a setting to make that change happen in the workflow? I do see there is a mass change of posting date app that can be run (also a background job), is that the only option?
Opening a closed period and restating financials cannot be the desired behavior for most companies and a similar requirement would exist in other areas like in the approval of general journal entries via workflow so I'm curious how SAP intends to their customers to address this in S/4HANA Cloud.
Thanks for your help,
Ryan
Hi Ryan As you pointed out, as soon as a user releases a supplier invoice in the My Inbox application the system checks whether the posting period is open with respect to the invoice's posting date and company code. There is no functionality developed to overwrite the posting date with the approval date. 
Hello,
in my SAP Build project, I'um using an Action that uses the S/4 Sandbox system from api.sap.com. Here I have an APIKey for authentication. Since I'm not able to set the API Key in the destination itself, I thought of using a variable in my SAP Build Process (similar to the destination variable) for the API Key. But there's no such functionality, any ideas how to implement it?
Thank you
Hello Christopher, 
Currently you cannot define the variable in SAP Build Process Automation. It is in the roadmap as we plan to introduce expression editor in process builder. For now, you have to use either API Management or CAP to prepare an API which already takes APIKey. 
Regards,Archana
Dear Archana Shukla 
I am not sure I understood your reply. I have set-up in API Management the APIKey policy. How to I pass the value , when I consume the API as Action in a SAP Build Process Automation?
Can you explain this once again? I have the same issue for my nose - that is why I also didn't open a new question.
Thank you
Monica
Hello Monica,
While creating Action Project in SAP Build Process Automation, you can define custom header and provide a value. Later you can use the same in Action in project
Hi Archana Shukla 
Very kind of you to check on this. Yes, this I figure out - I can create custom header, query parameters and both scenarios are working fine when I create the Actions project and test.
I have made the custom header also static and gave the key as fix value.
## see NOTE - this was one is solved
[ Nevertheless when I tried to use the Action in a process, it requires to give a value for that header input - where should that value come from? I can map in my input values of the Action what I have available from the start form or from outputs of previous steps. None I found suitable to keep an Api Key value.
What would be here the best approach?
]
NOTE : it is working perfectly fine as described above. Just don't set the custom header or custom query parameter mandatory. Make it static, give the API key in the Action Project and then you can use the Action in the process and all works fine :) 
Thank you
Monica
Hello Monica,
I am glad it worked. Yes currently header parameters can be mapped only if you have some data supplied from previous steps, we still do not support entering values in process. This is in roadmap. For now, you have to define fixed value in the Action Project as you have done. 
Regards,Archana
Hello Community,
Would you know how to increase the limit value in the report filter? Please, see my screenshot below:

Thank you in advance.

Probably, by exporting this report to the 3rd party data visualization software like MS Power BI. You can export the report URL and set the value of the count parameter to any you want.

Hello SAP Developers / Experts.
This Question is regarding the Clean Core , for future upgrades and safeguarding our investments /developments.
Our landscape is SAP S/4 HANA , on-premise. Recently we developed 3 application and the programming models we choose was RAP. But now decision in our organization are being taken that since we are on On-premise RAP will not follow clean we should not use RAP , but CAPM.
Can Experts please clear the doubts here , Is this the right approach going forward of course going forward, if we move to cloud we can choose either of one programming model.
Thanks and Best Regards ,
Shavneet Singh
Hello Shavneet,
You can certainly follow the "keep the core clean" strategy with RAP developments (both on-premise and in the cloud).
You can think of your SAP extensions belonging to 3 different tiers (or levels) as follows to keep-the-core-clean:
TIER 1:
ON STACK - ABAP Cloud and Key user tools
SIDE BY SIDE - Cloud development on BTP
On-stack means you are using the new 'ABAP Cloud' syntax to build upgrade safe extensions inside your core system. So RAP fits perfectly here. You must only use released APIs and the stricter syntax check of ABAP Cloud. (Note that to fully utilise this you need to be on a recent version of S/4HANA >= 2022 though it's still possible to follow this system with older releases.)
Note that ABAP Cloud just means a "cloud ready syntax for ABAP". You will see it also called "Embedded Steampunk". It is different to the ABAP environment on BTP (which also uses ABAP Cloud as the abap syntax).
Key user tools. These also run on-stack and are a suite of fiori apps in your S/4HANA system that enable you to customise things like adding or removing fields from screen; creating custom email templates and print forms and also inserting abap code like user exits, etc. But all in a completely upgrade/clean way.
Side-by-side means you are extending on BTP. You get added benefits of loose coupling both for your applications and also your pace of development. You can build and deploy and iterate faster in the cloud (as compared to possible slow change cycles for the core system). On BTP you can also use ABAP with the BTP ABAP environment and connect to released APIs on your on-premise SAP systems. You can also access all the other BTP tools and services (RAP, CAP, +++). 
p.s. My personal favourite is CAP. Its amazing what you can do in CAP with so few lines of code.
TIER 2:
What happens where you need an API or object that is NOT released?
Well that is where tier 2 comes in. You can create APIs here and use some more "classic" code and un-released function modules etc. But all for the sole purpose of being able to keep carrying on in TIER 1.
In fact you can develop here in such a way that you can swap out your tier 2 code if and when SAP releases what you need.
TIER 3:
This is the classic ABAP that we are all used to from ECC days and is to be avoided particularly for new developments.
So obviously it would be awesome to have everything in TIER 1, but its also not entirely practical. Try and complete everything with TIER 1 and using TIER 2 to handle missing APIs etc and for any TIER 3 code - look to retire it or to lift it up the tiers.
Clean core is a journey to be better and not something you can typically just switch on overnight. ;-)

Hello,

You just need to add xml message 


Hi
I have a Synchronous interface message that is to be Received in JSON format. I am using SAP PO7.50 REST Adapter .
If the Request message is received and processed ok then I will get a Response messageBut if not processed ok then I will a different message - an Exception message with detail of that.
How do I get the details of the Exception message and put that into the Service Interface Fault message - can this only be done via Comms Channel Error Handling - if so how to extract the error message?
For example.
{"ExceptionMessage": "Invalid property. Collection 'Task' doesn't contain property with name 'LatitudeDecimal'"}
In the Error Handling tab of CC, you can create your desired error message based on error HTTP Status Code or Status Text
An update to my question. There is a SAP NOTE that to use {http_result} you need to set a parameter or 2 on the REST Receiver's Module parameters. 
 
SAP Note 2273265 (Problem acessing error response message with internal variable and wrong message type for the generated XI message

You use Process Integration (PI) and you configure a REST receiver channel, which sends the payload to the partner server. If the partner server responds with non-200 HTTP code, you are not able to use internal variable {http_result} in the custom error handling.) 


1. If no custom error handling is used and the parameter "useResponseErrorMessage" of the 'rest' module is set to true - then an XI Application Error message is created with original payload from non-200 HTTP call if there is any.

2. If a custom error handling is used and the parameter "setAppErrorOnCustomMessage" of the 'rest' module is set to true - then an XI Application Error message is created with the payload from the configured custom error handling (e.g. internal variable {http_result}).

BUT even with those parameters set I still cannot see the {http_result} value when I use this in my Error Handling message - it just comes out like this unintepreted. 
<ExceptionMessage>CLICKFSE Exception occurred: {http_result}</ExceptionMessage>
We have the latest SAP PO7.50 and yet this does not work as expected. If only the {http_result} worked when I put it into my custom error handling on the REST Adapter but this is not populated - if it did work then no exception is trapped and the response would have the message.
So I still cannot use setAppErrorOnCustomMessage with the {http_result} as it is not translated. I'm on SAP PO7.5 SP10 Patch18 so it should.
I have used instead the useResponseErrorMessage. Although I get the Exception message in my Response the problem is that the Calling Proxy gets a Fault and so that Response message is no longer available and this contains all the information about the error. So in SXMB_MONI I can see the Response message with the error but I cannot get to it during the calling ABAP because an exception is raised.
I think this would be the same case for either setting. i.e. the Exception is getting in the way. 
So how do I get to the Response Message as that contains the full error message that I need?
You see the screen shot of my SXMB_MONI after the ABAP proxy call has finished - so I know the Response message contains the error - it is just that I cannot get to this message as the Proxy raises a fault due to the ApplicationError. How can I get to it from the ABAP?.

Hi, I am struggling to understand how to use the "Response Determination" tab of the REST Receiver adapter. I am on PI 7.5 SP 25. Please do not direct me to the "REST Adapter - Don't be afraid" blogs. While quite informative about a variety of basic REST issues, he does not provide any significant insight into this feature. If I understand correctly, I can specify the root element of the response message in the Operation / Namespace columns. then the Service interface of the target response in the Response / Response Namespace fields. This should then redirect the response to the ICO that defines the processing for that Service. Alternatively, if anyone has any other suggestions on handling the response from an OData service call that can return either "feed" "entry" or "error" as the root message that would also solve my problem :)

Has anybody had similar problems and an idea what the solution might be?
Thanks
Maria
Hi Maria - the problem sounds similar to this SAP Note https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3304386 (logon required) - SAP says "it is under investigation"
Hi Maria, you might want to open a ticket with SAP support in case you need ad-hoc updates or refer to the SAP note. Best regards, Antoine
The above SAP Note refers to a different issue where the PDF can still be opened but will be missing one or more pages. I am not certain this refers to the same issue you are having.
However, we have recently identified an issue that can cause PDF exports to be significantly larger if using certain styling formats, especially dotted lines. This can also cause publication to fail or be corrupted.
Can you check to see if the PDF generated is significantly larger than previously if you generate it manually from your story? If so then it's likely your issue is due to this same problem and will be fixed in a patch release this weekend.

Hello,
I was wondering whether anybody in the community has experience with using the Activity category within the Dictionary. What is the use-case you are using it for? I would love to hear from you. Thanks.
Kind regards,
Vladimir
Hi Vladimir,
the dicitionary usage on activity level is not enforced. However we find it useful to further describe our activities in the description. Many activities are reusable. So it is easy to maintain the description centrally in the dictionary. For example the creation of purchase orders is the same for different processes. Our user maintain the description in the dictionary and with that change it automatically in other processes as well.
Another example is the central administration of web services. For us describing a web service works best on activity level. We defined web services as a subcategory and have a great overview of our used web services and see the assigned processes.
However this is not enforced in the model check. Using it for every activity (even if it is used just once) would be too much maintenance effort.
Kind regards 
Jonas 
Hi Vladimir,
we are using the activities in the dictionary the same like Jonas explained it. We save into dictionary only activities that are reusable.
Cheers

Hi,
I am trying use CAP to create Odata services on an existing database in HANA cloud. Since the tables exist my model has been created with annotation @cds.persistence.exists on entities.
However, since I want to test the solution in development (via sqlite), is it possible to generate the tables in SQLite only i.e. in development? Otherwise I am not able to test the application in development and have to deploy it always.
Regards,
Nitin 
You can move the HANA specific @cds.persistence.exists annotations into a separate folder. This is best practise in general if you need to distinguish database specific functionality, e.g. SAP HANA functions.
In order to avoid redundant model definitions, create a separate file db/hana/index.cds containing all @cds.persistence.exists annotations, e.g.:
Add the following to the cds configuration to your project:
cds watch will create the corresponding tables in the sqlite database as the development profile is used while cds build --production will not create the .hdbtable artifacts as the model folder db/hana is added to the list of compiled models setting the annotations for the corresponding entities.
For further details see https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-samples/blob/main/fiori/package.json#L41. There is also a CodeTour (Database Functions Step8) for VSCode you can follow.
Regards,Lothar
Hi Lothar,
How do you tell the service i.e. service.cds which path to pick the model from? /db/sqlite or /db/hana
 It is not clear from the samples as well.

I think there two options:

b) Ask from your developer to create a custom CDS View using ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse. They can then combine the necessary fields from the relevant tables without impacting the original CDS Views.

Dear Experts,
Note - 2779323 speaks about transfer of packing instructions as packing specifications to EWM system.
Regarding packspec change, the note reads as below :
Description: Packaging specification header carries a logical system (LOGSYS). If this value of this field in EWM is equal to the logical system (LOGSYS) of the system & client, the packaging specification knows that the current system is the owner and primary system and allows for maintenance. You can change packaging specifications in EWM, and these changes can be triggered in ERP as well. However, these changes won’t be replicated to EWM again to avoid overwriting.
We are using embedded EWM and would like to centrally maintain the packing instruction and have the changes transferred to the packing specifications.
Please suggest.
Thanks,
Mageshwaran Sivasamy
So... What is your question?
Hello Zhang,
Below is the question.
Changing a packing instruction should update the corresponding packing spec in embedded EWM.
How to achieve it ?
Thanks,
Mageshwaran Sivasamy
Hello Mageshwaran,
at our client the ERP system is the owner and primary system for distribution of the packaging information to embedded EWM. We have faced same issues that CIF replication did not trigger correctly the packaging data or condition records after any change in POP2 or POF2 transaction. After many incidents raised to SAP following Notes are necessary for S/4HANA 2020 release and downwards.
The last SAP note is not yet released for customers yet or it might be under updation. You may have to wait for its official release or you contact SAP directly and they will release the Note specifically for your customer.
Hello Roland, 
Thanks a lot for the update.
Even after implementing all the notes, we still have error /SCWM/PS_BASICS 233.
"Packing specification has logical system X , can not be replicated to original system".
Do you have any idea how to overcome it ?
Thanks,
Magesh
Dear Roland,
We took this topic to SAP and we were told that change transfer of packing instructions to EWM is not supported in the embedded environment.
Did you work with this topic in embedded environment using developments ?
Thanks,

I get the error "com.sap.it.rt.adapter.http.api.exception.HttpResponseException: An internal server error occured: Request Payload Parsing Failed for one of the reason: (1) Either the OData metadata content available in the server is outdated OR (2) The request payload seems to be incorrect. Error Details : Entity Set Shipment not found in the edmx.."
What could be the reason for the same?
The incoming payload is in JSON format which is converted XML in the flow, and a XSLT mapping is used to remove the root node added during conversion. the generated XML is then fed to OData adapter. 
We have tested the payload in gateway and we get '201' response.
The XML payload being sent to OData adpater-
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><Shipment>Z</Shipment><shipperRefDocuments><docId>00</docId><shipment_id>bkk</shipment_id><docType_code>73</docType_code></shipperRefDocuments><shipperRefDocuments><docId>009</docId><shipment_id>bkkj</shipment_id><docType_code>73</docType_code></shipperRefDocuments><eta>2023-03-20T15:21:31Z</eta><actualTechnicalTimestamp>2023-02-15T15:21:37.132Z</actualTechnicalTimestamp><logicalSystem>C</logicalSystem><transportationMode_code>01</transportationMode_code>
JSON file expected at backend SAP system
{
"Shipment":"Z",
"shipperRefDocuments":[
 {
 "docId":"00",
 "shipment_id":"bkk",

 Any input is much appreciated.
Hi Smitha,
The XML payload that you are sending to ODATA adapter does not have the root tag.
Create XSD structure from EDMX and check the required root tag name.
Use the same root tag name while sending data to ODATA adapter.

I want to use SAP CPI to define a switch-case logic. But it does not work as expected.

I want the flow run different mapping according to the http request header 'TransferMethod'. Below is the request I send in Postman

But the flow always run the default path.
Hi Joseph,
Have you allowed the headers in your iflow?

Hi Experts,
I was trying to add attachments to a fi document via program and tried the following code and succeeds. The document get attached but while opening the attachments if the type is docs or xlsx there is an error message saying the file is corrupted. We can retrieve the file but is there any way that we can avoid the error message popup. I tried everything found many similar questions and problems but none could help. The common point found was the object size we are passing is not correct . 
attaching the code here , So is there any way that we could fetch correct file size

In the component OBJLEN of the parameter object_hd_change of SO_OBJECT_INSERT, you should indicate the actual number of bytes of the file, not an arbitrary number.
In your code, the actual number of bytes is stored in the variable OUTPUT (you have given a weird name).
But for some reason, you do a very strange calculation which is useless and completely incorrect (ls_obj_data-objlen = ( lv_lines - 1 ) * 255 + strlen( wa_content ).)
So, in your code it should be:
I'm getting an error running a simple iflow to perform a SOAP call using a Timer, Content Modifier, and Request/Response:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The PayLoad elements cannot fit with the message parts of the BindingOperation. Please check the BindingOperation and PayLoadMessage.
This error seems to be saying thay that CPI is validating the XML payload and the validation is failing before it calls the web service. I see this problem has been posted several times and several answers given and I've tried many solutions but none have corrected the problem for me. 
I successfully used SOAPUI to call the same webservice method and it worked and returned a token:

When creating the iFlow I uploaded the WSDL as a resource, and in the SOAP channel I selected the LOGIN operation and SAP auto-populated the channel operation and added the namespace to the Runtime Configuration:

The SOAP connection:

I traced the payload sent to the webservice and it looked ok:

This is the error as it appeared in the log:

The WSDL is located here:
https://test.c3reservations.com/BreakthruBev-WS/PurchaseOrderWebService?wsdl

Can anyone see what I need to change to make this work?
Thanks in advance!!!
I overcame the validation error by blanking out these four fields in the SOAP channel configuration:

I've found the problem. In the SOAP connection screen, if the WSDL field is filled in, the SOAP channel tries to find a complex type in the WSDL for that operation in order to validate the tags in the payload. Eg in this case I was calling the LOGIN operation, so it was looking for a complex type (it would have the tag <xs:complexType> in the WSDL) bound to the login operation, but there wasn't any, so the validation fails, and SAP issues this message "PayLoad elements cannot fit with the message parts of the BindingOperation" meaning SAP can't validate the tags in the payload.
So for me there were two possible solutions: 
Solution 1: add the missing complex type to the WSDL and then populate the WSDL, Service, Endpoint and Operation Name fields. If you populate them this permits you to configure specific web service security policies for that operation. Or, 
Solution 2: leave the WSDL, Service, Endpoint and Operation Name fields blank if you don't need to create a specific security policy on this operation, and CPI won't attempt to validate the tags in the payload and will just pass it to the web service.
This article was very helpful in figuring this out:

Hello Ken,
Create a message mapping just before making call to your SOAP Service having target structure as target systems WSDL to make sure all the required namespaces are sent then it should resolve your issue

Experts:
I am trying to use the MinCapaUsage KF to force downtime on my resource for a few weeks. I've used the Violation Cost Rate for this KF & also made sure it is higher than the storage/production/transport costs. However, the TS Optimizer doesn't respect it & plans the full quantity. Our CAPASUPPLY KF is non editable as we interface it from S/4.
Any clues?
Cheers
Hi,
Just had the same issue. I believe the MINCAPAUSAGEVIOLATIONCOSTRATE is calculated by the optimizer as a one-time cost if MINCAPAUSAGE constraint is not respected. Where with other cost key figures, the optimizer calculates the cost per UoM that is below the constraint.
I entered a very high MINCAPAUSAGEVIOLATIONCOSTRATE of 100.000 to ensure this is the highest cost for optimizer as my client needs to produce at 100% at all times. This solved my issue.
Let me know if this helped.
Hi,

When i use the transaction MIRO, under basic data, there is an option to enter the invoice amount. When tax is calculated, i believe it is calculated on this amount. Now if i have a PO with one line item of amount say 1200, is it possible to split this amount into two say 1000 and 200 and apply tax via different tax codes, keeping in mind that there is only one line item. If there is a solution to this please keep me posted.

Thanks in advance.
Hi Shiju

In OBY6 transaction - your company code global settings, there is a field called ENABLE AMOUNT SPLIT, enable the check box and try entering the split amountin the invoice.

Hope this works.
thanks

Hi,
    The Tax code in the header is infomational / Serves as default.
The actual tax calculation takes place at the PO item level.
Each PO item can have different Taxe codes.
If you press on "Acct Assgn" you can even set-up multiple FI- line items for a single PO item.

Kind regards
hello,how do i split the amount base on the GR purchase number ,since we MIRO one invoice from multiple PO number . i want to split the AP amount to mutiple item base on the each PO.

Hello there,
I'm just wondering where the setting to turn the sidebar on and off is within Producer? I've trawled through the various Playback Settings and the nearest thing I could find was turning off the Show Tree setting within Playback Settings > Library > Visual Properties.
However, that just minimises the sidebar rather than disabling it completely. 

Many Thanks,

There must be a way to completely hide it. Probably, by adjusting the trainer files (outside the configuration dialog). 
I will try and if succeed, will post an updated files here. 
You can probably change it to hidden in the CSS...

Hi Expert team:
SAP-client in the url of Fiori like this
https://abc.wdf.sap.corp:44302/sap/bc/ui2/flp/?sap-client=001&sap-language=EN#Shell-home

is this mean SAP backend?
I found that even the url show sap-client=001 but the transaction also updated on client 800 as well.
Pls advise.
it is very likely you have two abap system in your sap system,
one to run fiori app, (you specify 001 for this server)
one to run abap code(1st server is connecting to this server using rfc, where 800 is specified)
that's the archtecture 3,4 years ago, nowadays two abap server are merged to one

Hi,

Please check in OBY6, that your company code is having a country.

If not, then you need to check program LTAX2F01 (FORM DETERMINE_KALSM_FROM_BUKRS) in debug mode with your ABAPer help.

If you unable to modify the Country code at OBY6 transaction.
go to SM30 , Enter the table V_T001 and update the country code to your Company code.

Hi All,
I am pretty new to EWM. In our manufacturing plant, we have designed the putaway for manufacturing Semi-FGs into one common storage bin. 
If the semi-FG has no need quality inspection, it will go to the bin using PPF action directly. If semi-FG needs quality inspection, it will use the quality usage decision follow-up action to create WT and putaway into same bin. 
We found sometimes when there are 2 usage decisions made at the same time, system normally locks the bin then 2nd UD didn't create the WT successfully. One of the suggestion is to implement the BAdI and set the EV_Abort = X. We have implemented but somehow system still tried to find next available bin thus it is always failed because we only have search strategy to put into this storage type and there is only one storage bin in this storage type. 
Do you have better way to resolve this issue? or I have create 1 or more bins in this storage type in case of described situation happens again which is not ideal way to resolve this.
Thanks all.

Thanks Juergen / Ajit your feedback! Sorry I didn't aware that you are answer my question.
For the putaway strategy, we are use storage type search strategy only for this specific issue. It has been mapped to this storage type properly because normal putaway all successful while this issue only happens when there are 2 QC making usage decision at the same time. 1st WT always blocked the only in this storage type. We only have one bin in this storage type.
For WT generic setting in Storage type, it has been setup as blank (Not generic - storage type, storage section and storage bin).
Please let me know if you need further information.

Hello,I would like to know if there is some way to delete the modeler data using Data Action or Multi-Function action
I tried the DELETE() function in data action but this replaces the data as null and doesn't clear the data.
I wanted to perform the delete action as shown in below fig

but not manually as above but using a data action or a type of multi-function action API or anything else

Regards,
If a user has write access to a dimension member via DAC, then that user will be able to update the fact data for that dimension by entering a zero (0), clearing the data in the table and publishing it, or going into the model and selecting the delete facts option. From a Data Action point of view I think DELETE() is the optimum choice.
Nikhil
Hi Rijin Baby,
   DELETE() keyword actually should perform the same as fact delete from model.  I guess you see null only because other measures are not deleted.  If you delete all measures, you should see record been cleared. 
Hello all,
I am getting an error "unknown service id" when trying to view the data in JOIN or UNION node in the graphical view or sql view i created in SAP DWC. I tried to use the local table created and populated using data flow in DWC and i tried using the table created using real time replication in DWC as well. Both of them showing same error . 

But i am able to use data viewer if the view is not having any join and its having only one table in it.

i am using 90 days trial account to use DWC. Please let me know how to check the details of this error and resolve it. 
Thanks
//PK
Check the cardinality in JOIN. I remember that if it wasn't right, I got that error or a similar one at some point.
Also check that the view you are making does not have an association with one of the joined tables.
I hope that helps.
Hi Xavier,
Thanks for your inputs :)
But just want to let you know that i tried all the combinations of cardinality , none to none, one(0,1) to many, many to many, exactly 1 to exactly 1. Nothing works. Also i am not using any associations in my view.

//PK
Encountered the same error with trial version attempting to preview data in a join, projection, or calculated node. The output also generated the same error, but once saved and deployed successfully the view previewed correctly.

Hi team,
I am following the exercise for creating a CAP-Based Service, step by step. However, in step two after creating schema.cds the expected results does not happen. The two entities Risks, and Mitigations, are not created anywhere and the model is not created. cds watch keeps complaining:
" No models found in db/,srv/,app/,schema,services,srv\external\API_BUSINESS_PARTNER.
 Waiting for some to arrive..." 
I can see package-lock.json, and package.json and .npmrc and .cdsrc.json all showing under /home/user/projects/risk-management. So what is missing? The exercise says I don't have to do anything else beyond creating the two entities to see the model appear. 
Thank you in advance.

This issue is resolved.  It was due to a mistake.

Dear Team
How is the Plan cost amount get calculated for Fixed Price (Cost at POC) foreign currency projects?
We have projects in USD all amounts are in USD on Planned Customer Projects and in company code currency on the Event Based Revenue Recognition. 
We noticed that Plan Cost amount on the EBRR simulation is silently more than what we expect it to be. 
On Plan Customer Project Planned Costs = 22 500 co code currency.

After actual time charge - Simulation of EBRR displays steps and calculations - Step 2 shows Actuals and Plan cost related to values. Happy with Actuals value.
Not understanding why Plan is more by 121.74 expected value here was 22 500 not 22 621.74

Do you know how it the Plan Cost on the simulation is calculated for foreign currency projects - Fixed Price contract type(Cost based POC)? 
will appreciate your swift response. 
Thank you.
Kind regards
Angelina 

Hi Angelina,
Please check the cookbook for Event-Based Revenue Recognition.Search the chapter with keyword: "Cost-Based POC Method".

"Planned costs: EBRR always uses the current “dynamic EAC” to calculate POC for event-based cost. This is independent even if the customer uses “Review Customer Project” App."

So please check the EAC value for the WBS Element in “Review Customer Project”

Hi all,
Can anyone please help with how to restrict the soap adapter in SAP CPI for adding the default soap envelope that it adds to the payload while sending data to an external system?
Hi
The envelope is part of SOAP, so it doesn't really make a lot of sense to remove it. It sounds to me like what you need is the HTTP adapter, which will just pass the raw payload unchanged to the receiver.

Hello Experts,
I am looking to create a running total for every material in my model and then break those totals down into percentages per functional area per month. I would like this calculation to be stored in the model, as opposed to a story, if possible. I am currently using SAC to S/4 HANA cloud connection, import model - not live. 
For example, I have material X and material Y. 15 of Material X were consumed in functional area 1 in Jan, and 10 were consumed in functional area 2, but only 5 of those in January. So, 75% vs 25% would be my expected split for Material X in Jan. 
What is the easiest way to accomplish this?
Thank you! 
Daniel Koenig
Assuming that both Material and FA are dimensions. You can try something like below.
Create a calculated Account/Measure called [Quantity Aggr] for aggregating the Quantity across Sales org ( in your case FA) .
Below example is based on an Account Model with Account member [QUANTITY]. The same can be replicated in Measure based Model using calculated Measures.
Quantity Aggr: Quantity aggregated by sales Org
Consumption Split:
Output:

Hope this helps !!
Please upvote/accept if this helps.

Hi, 
You can use grandtotal function and try to get 75% and 25% in the value, 
While displaying display functional area in column and in row material X and month 
it will show you 75% VS 25%

This question is about the determination of the Transaction Group in the context of SAP configuration transaction AOLK - Specify Tab Layout for Asset Master Record.
In my system, there are multiple values for "Transaction Group" assigned to an asset class. This implies that different tab layouts can be assigned to different user categories, represented by the different Transaction Group values.

When maintaining the asset with AS01/AS02/AS03 the tabs seem to be appear in accordance with the the tab layout "ZBP2" which is assigned to transaction group "OTHERS".
I cannot find any customising table that controls the subsequent assignment of this transaction group.
Can someone please provide some guidance on the usage and subsequent determination of the transaction group.

Hi,
Is it possible to specify the approuter version that the MDK deploys to Web with? We're experiencing some issues and I would like to update to the latest approuter version if possible.
Thanks
John
Hi John,
Currently, we use a router template for MDK deployment and no MDK configuration for customization. But you can change it and make a full deployment manually.
1) Open package.json from /WebApplicationFactory/${youApp}-approuter/ folder, change the version of @sap/approuter, remove node_modules if it has.
2) Click ‘Build MTA Project’ from the context menu of /WebApplicationFactory/mta.yaml
3) Click ‘Deploy MTA Archive’ from the context menu of /WebApplicationFactory/${yourApp}.mtar
Above deployment will do a full deployment with the new router. When you deploy from Application.app next time, it will do a incremental deployment, and has NO change for the router.

Hi All,
My requirement is to connect S/4HANA on Cloud to BW7.0 ( SP10 ) system hence I am looking for various options to extract the data via standard extractor/custom extractors from S/4HANA to BW7.0.
Could you please let me know various options available ? And also does S/4HANA provides only ODP enabled extractors and if yes can we connect S/4HANA and BW7.0 via ODP framework ?
SAP ABAP Core Data Services (CDS) is a core technology for data modeling in SAP S/4HANA Cloud
Extracting data using a CDS view and the ODP framework requires a minimum version on both the source (ABAP)
and target (BW) systems.
Source Requirements
• SAP BW 7.50 >= SP5
• SAP BW/4HANA (DW4CORE) >= SP01
Target Requirements
• SAP BW (> 7.3x)
• SAP BW/4HANA (DW4CORE) >= SP00
You can understand the role of CDS which can be used in the context of SAP BW powered by SAP HANA or SAP BW/4HANA. https://blogs.sap.com/2016/11/04/abap-cds-in-sap-bw/

SAP S/4HANA Cloud Data Integration Overview with BW
https://blogs.sap.com/2021/05/12/part-2-sap-s-4hana-cloud-data-integration-overview/
Please follow the steps as extraction capability relies on ABAP CDS Views which serve as new type of “extractors” with proprietary delta capabilities. There are roughly three core activities required to prepare this approach:
a) Setup a communication arrangement between both systems
b) Create a new BW/4HANA ODP_CDS Source System
c) Transfer the data from Cloud to the target BW/4HANA
Learn more with the blog post. https://blogs.sap.com/2021/09/22/sap-cloud-integration-into-sap-bw-4hana/
Hope this helps clarify your understanding on extraction options from SAP S/4HANA Cloud
Hello Experts, 
As seen below, the error "Schema of data has been changed! Unable to Map: Business Transaction Type" populated after the recent SAP upgrade/update. 
My question is simply, what is the easiest way to resolve? I couldn't imagine it's remaking the model and associated stories from scratch. What am I missing? 

Hello SAP community
1. I want to get a report that shows daily stock or stock as at a key date or between dates and their movements.
Can anyone point me to where I can find it if there is one available. But if there is none, Kindly advice on the data sources to join or combine suitable for this purpose.
2. I want to also get a report that shows logistic areas with zero stock
Thanks in advance

各专家们：
上午好。
我们现在有一批过期的物料，无法销售，但是可以把这个物料拆分成两个部分回用。请问，这样的一种业务形式有标准流程可以走吗？（财务还想体现拆分后的物料的成本。）
请不吝解惑。
SAP可以通过app “不含物料的生产订单” ，创建订单类型为 YBW1 的返工工单实现此功能。

1.创建一张返工工单，在订单组件中添加需要拆分的头物料，数量为正；同时在订单组件中添加需要拆分出的物料号，数量维护成负数，这样对这种工单发料后，你就会得到拆分出来的料号库存（移动类型262 计划内退料），并消耗掉拆分前的头物料库存（移动类型261 计划内发料）。
2.创建一张返工工单，将过期的物料投入到这张放工工单中（移动类型261 计划外投料），然后直接针对这张工单做拆分物料的计划外退料，这样同样会得到拆分出来的料号库存（移动类型262 计划外发料）。
以上两种方式都可以，都能实现消耗掉过期物料的库存，同时得到拆分后物料的库存。
另外，可以在返工工单中添加需要投入的工序，这样可以将拆分的工时报工到此张返工工单中。

Hello Surbhi, 
if your question is about "S/4HANA on-premise" or "S/4HANA Cloud, private edition":
We plan to include an advanced intercompany sales scenario in the upcoming SAP S/4HANA 2022 Fully-Activated Appliance (which can be deployed via the SAP Cloud Appliance Library, https://cal.sap.com). 
Planned availability date for the 2022 release in CAL is around December 20th, 2022.
An overview about the appliance can be found here, a detailed step-by-step guide is referenced from the SAP S/4HANA trial page.

Hi community,
I am trying to repicate S/4HANA CDS View I_Customer to HANA Cloud using SDI. S/4HANA version is 2022 SPS00.
I have created a virtual table and added shared replica as below.
create virtual table "FVT_I_CUSTOMER_CDS" at "remotesource"."<NULL>"."<NULL>"."ABAP_CDS.I_CUSTOMER_CDS$P";
alter virtual table "FVT_I_CUSTOMER_CDS" add shared replica;
Now, when I create a new customer at S/4HANA, the replica table shows newly created data. However, if I update an existing customer, it doesn't show updated data. Does anyone have an idea why updates are not transferred?

FYI.
When I execute the following query, 
select TABLE_NAME, IS_REPLICA from TABLES where TABLE_NAME = 'FVT_I_CUSTOMER_CDS';
The result shows that IS_REPLICA column is FALSE.

Mio

Hello community, 
I need help with SAP TM embedded feature. 
My customer is using BP configuration with all ROL types associated (general + customer + vendor + carrier + transport). I am using that BP number in my FO document as my carrier, but they changed the CVI and for all types of settlement documents flow (ME21N + HES + so on) they are using VENDOR (LIFNR) number and not the BP number. 
How can I select the VENDOR field (LIFNR) instead of the BP number in my TM documents to create all documents flow to complete the process? 
Thanks!!!! (edited) 

Hi,
if you still able to use the BP in TM process as normal BP role carrier, I suggest you to keep it standard.
Carrier will populated in TM as long them are open as BP role "carrier" between FU/FO/FSD and PO Service.
If somehow the integration with other process is take as you mentioned (LIFNR) will apply to other process as ME21N etc.
In TM there is a structure you can use to search a BP with different criteria's go to Tx BOBT and open /SCMTMS/BUPA.

Hi, we've been trying to create a customization for Many-Many relationships using VBScript. PD 16.7 SP05 Help for property Relationship Type states that:
Defined values for RelationshipType : 0 One - One 1 One - Many 2 Many - One 3 Many - Many 
But when a many-many relationship is created, PD executes InitializationHandler 3 times, with RelationshipType 1,1,2 respectively. Same applies for other cardinality-related properties such as Entity1ToEntity2RoleMaximumCardinality. Is there any other way to identify a relationship being created/initialized on LDM as many-to-many ?
Thanks in advance,
Eduardo. 
Hi,
I am afraid, that there is not other way how to find it out in real time. Obviously PD creates some "basic" relationship, then Initialize event handler is applied and AFTER that some specifications (many-to-many cardinality for example) are being set. 
You can experiment with other handlers but you have no control of when and how many times are the triggered. You can even use Validate handler, which is triggered each time you change something on ALREADY EXISTING relationship. But it will not help you during Relationship creation.
Or you can accept the fact, that catching many-to-many relationship in real time is not possible and transform your algorithm into Custom Check for example. It is not real time but you have better control of what is happening in your model.
Regards,
Ondrej Divis
Hi, thanks for you reply. We have experimented with it and Initialization Handler is called 3 times. But never with RelationshipType = 3 as stated in Documentation. And as we already have initialization in place for all other Relationship types, removing the initialization handler would cause more harm than good. So we might remove NxN from Toolbox and ask users to create them manually. Thanks again !!!
After a physical table (Pervasive 13) was converted and a key was changed from Numeric to String, old report still use a field type numeric (and actually converts the alpha to number) and gives wrong results. New reports are working fine. I expacted Crystal (2020) to give me a message as soon as I access the database and suggest to convert the type, but it didn't. Thanks. 
You need to go to the Database menu and select "Verify Database" in order to pick up the new field types - Crystal doesn't automatically update them when you change the table.

Hi colleagues,
I am developing fiori elements with odata v4. The fiori tooling generator creates nice test pages and the sap-fe-mockserver is much better then the old mockserver.
However when it comes to karma testing (local and in pipeline). I am a little bit lost.
Using karma-ui5 causes some problems.
The ui5.configPath ui5-local.yaml is not loading/mounting the sap-ui-core and more correctly. Karma server uses ./base/webapp/resources while fiori-tools-proxy listens to ./resources. I could add ../../../../ to all references but this looks weird. See https://answers.sap.com/questions/13665378/ui5-karma-config-404-on-ui5-resource-load.html
Does someone has a working example that uses own yaml with fiori-tools-proxy and sap-fe-mockserver?
Greetings and thanks,
Daniel
Well, after a night of try & error I found a solution that works for me.
in karma.conf.js I set the configPath to my own yaml especially for karma setup. Additionally I tweak a little bit to get my stuff covered by coverage reporter.

The ui5-karma.yaml:

Here it seems to be very important to listen to /base/... . So I do not need to adjust all sapui5 core in the html's references to ../../../../. I can just keep it as it is.
Finally it seems that own shortened resource roots are causing trouble and I did not want to face it yet. So I took the same resource root alias as in the main application. Typically the generator create a opa templat with a shortened one.

This setup runs OPA and QUnit

It also runs locally and on jenkins. We are using our own jenkins pipeline and trigger karma with this step
https://www.project-piper.io/steps/karmaExecuteTests/
Greetings,
Daniel
hello Daniel, 
Thank You for this post. We are facing issues with karma runner and OPA5. 
For reference, we downloaded the code from https://github.com/SAP-samples/fiori-tools-samples, and navigated to V4/apps/salesorder. Installed karma and tested and it shows us a metadata error. We noticed this in your post "It also runs locally and on jenkins.". I am trying this on IntelliJ locally. 
Your recommendation "Finally it seems that own shortened resource roots are causing trouble and I did not want to face it yet. So I took the same resource root alias as in the main application. Typically the generator create a opa templat with a shortened one." did not work for us, so we left it as is. 
Do you have any suggestions please?

Hi everyone,
is there an way to make out of two values in incoming message a tree structure in target message? In my case I will process an CSV files with order Information. What I have already is to make out of flat structure order file a tree structure order with header and item Information. (1 header to N items). Problem is still that I have price and discount as separat field in csv file.And target ODATA structure is expecting the info like this:
 "to_PricingElement": [
 { "ConditionType": "PPR0", "ConditionRateValue": "100", "ConditionCurrency": "EUR" }, { "ConditionType": "YK07", "ConditionRateValue": "0.10", "ConditionCurrency": "EUR" } ],
Here is example file for the flat structure: example-flat-orders.xml

I've always used Groovy Script and iterated the records comparing current record to previous using XMLSlurper to create a new payload that included header/child relationships.
Others may be aware of more elegant way to do this via Message Mapping but the only way I've managed to solve this is Groovy Script.
Thanks,Marty
Hello, 
I would do this through the message mapping step but first I would use an XSLT mapping to group the orders by order ID and then use a message mapping step which would be very easy to do once the relevant orders are grouped together. Set the context to the level of the "grouped" orders. 
e.g. 
<Message>
<OrderGroup ID=62592178551>
<order>...</order>
<order>...</order>
</OrderGroup>
<OrderGroup ID=62592178552>
<order>...</order>
<order>...</order>
</OrderGroup>
</Message>
Good luck!
Kind regards,

I am utilizing the SF_EMP_Turnover_Analysis_v1 template story report. The "Hires" calculation says if the Event = 3669 or 3676....But the query data doesn't use those code values. Does anyone know what these values represent??



I need to substitute different values for 3669 or 3676 but not sure what values to use.
I found the analysis document which explains this report, but it does not define the calculations for this item. SF_EMP_Turnover_Analysis_v1.0.pdf
Any input will be greatly appreciated!!!
Thank you!!
Hi Shelly,
Those numbers are the Picklist Option IDs for the Events your report is filtering on.
3676 = Rehire
3669 = Hire
As you can tell, my demo instance has the same event Option IDs as your report filters. These are the default Option IDs for all instances
In your instance:
See the screenshot below to for how to navigate in Picklist Center to find your events, and view the option ID. It's unlikely that the Picklist and option IDs for "event" were edited previously.
Update your filter with the option IDs to match the Events that you want to include or exclude in your report.

For example, if an employee has completed the same course 3 times, and those 3 course completions are in their learning history with three different completion dates (first completion date is 01/01/2019, second is 05/31/2020 & last date is 12/31/2022) then I only want my report to output that latest 12/31/2022 completion date for that course.
Currently, my report outputs 3 rows for the same course, each with a different completion date, but I only want 1 row with the latest completion date.
Any help is appreciated!
Hi Team,
I have a table which is the dynamic one where i need to delete those duplicae entries based on key fields alone.
Kindly suggest me the same.
I have tried below one where it deleted comparing all fields but im looking for only key fields in dynamic program.
delete adjacent duplictes <lt_data> comparing all fields.
Regards,
Karthik S
DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES FROM <data> COMPARING ('FIELD')
Note however, that DELETE ADJACENT DUPLICATES FROM <data> on its own will only compare key fields. So if you've defined the table as having a key, then it will work fine. If you've not defined a key, then by default the key fields will be the all the character fields up until the first non-character field.

Is there any other Config Settings to be changed to make "Never" as default ?
Attached are the screenshots from SPRO and Work order. 
spro.jpg


 Thanks,
Venkata.
In your test you might be using  a PM order which was created before you did the configuration change.
If you already had an operation which was set to create requisitions/reservations immediately and you reserve materials to it , SAP is going to default the indicator to whatever was on the operation - not to what is in your configuration. 
To verify the configuration, create a brand new PM order and when you create an operation see what is the default that SAP is giving you. 
In which table can i find this field AUDISP, when i save the order - operation/component?Regards,Ajay
Table field for AUDISP is NO_DISP you can find it in AFVC for operations and in RESB for material component.

Thanks in advance
Hi Daniel,
With regards to your question "How can we find out the HANA thread ID and session of the executed SM66 Work process number?" - are you referring to pass executed SAP process/job, or the one that is currently running?
I you are trying to find the current running work process in SM66 <-> HANA connections/thread you could follow the below. 
1) First, check in the source system if SAP under SM50 of the PID for that particular work process. See below.
2023-02-23-135504.jpg
2) Then you could determine the client session of source IP and PID in HANA studio performance tab example below.

With such check you will find the information required.

Hi. On my current client I requested a SAP S ID from the Basis team. I thought it was a new SAP S ID. I can log into BTP with no problems. When I look at my profile it has my correct current email. Then I start Business Application Studio. Then I get a blank screen that says, “Where to?”. Also it has an old, incorrect, email in the top right corner. I did create BTP and BAS on a previous project using that old email. When I did, I followed these steps: Set Up SAP Business Application Studio for Development | Tutorials for SAP Developers. I can’t follow those steps now of course since BAS won’t start now. I have deleted that application and recreated it with no change. Is that old email, that still seems to be connected to my S ID, the reason BTP won’t start? Who and how do I request the correction of the email ID? Is that something my current Basis team can correct? Thanks for your help,

I am working with a live connection to SAP S/4 HANA Cloud, but i am also interested in solutions for other connections.
Thanks for your answer!

Hello All,
I saw  Jonathan Haun's message and I just want to contribute the discussion. Tagging  Thomas Karner,  Max One, and  Peter KREUTLEIN . What I see is:
Account Types (INC, EXP, AST, LEQ, NFIN) as an Attribute of an Account Dimension are available only for:
Account Types (INC, EXP, AST, LEQ, NFIN) are not available for:
Regards,Tuncay
Reverse sign is handled under specific cases for the account (measure) dimension.
See the online help regarding "Attributes of an Account Dimension"
https://help.sap.com/viewer/00f68c2e08b941f081002fd3691d86a7/release/en-US/15d49a3a617a4f608a7b7a27c129be85.html
Account Types
The Account dimension uses an Account Type attribute to automatically handle positive and negative values. From an accounting perspective, account members belonging to the Profit and Loss statement and the Balance Sheet have to be correctly stored in the database with either a positive or negative value so that the accounts balance correctly. In SAP Analytics Cloud, you can enter all values as positive numbers, and the switching of signs from positive to negative is handled automatically on the basis of the Account Type setting.
There are four financial account types: Income (INC) and Expense (EXP) items are included in the Profit and Loss account, and Assets (AST) and Liabilities (LEQ) are Balance sheet items. Automatic switching is applied to the account types INC and LEQ. Note that all formulas work on the displayed value, not the value saved in the database.
When importing data from an external system, a mapping feature is available to ensure that imported data also fits into this schema. This feature is switched on using the Reverse the Sign of the Data Based on Account Type check box in the Details panel when importing data. When this check box is activated, imported data will also be identified by account type and stored and handled correctly.
Hi Peter,
thank you!
So reverse the sign is only available for imported data?
Best regards 
Anna
 Peter KREUTLEIN How can reverse sign be handled when using S/4 HANA Live-Connection?
Unless someone can prove otherwise, this is not possible for live data connections. You have to import the data into the SAC dimension object to setup this funcationality. 
Sign reversal is possible for live connection for GL Account/ FSV using FSV(Financial Statement version). You can reverse the sign in the S4 system in FSV nodes and it will reflect in the SAC report( Using the FSV hierarchy)
Dear All,
We have a case where we create purchase orders in large quantities, and these quantities arrive at our warehouses after a long period (because of the country’s situation, the arrival of the goods is delayed), the goods remain at dock of the port, and customs, clearance and rent fees are all paid by 30% of the value of the PO, for this ( In order to raise the cost of the goods). I add these costs in PO (in prices tab under surchage%) and then I create new expense report to an employee with the full value of the costs in order for him to deliver the goods (temperoary until the actual customs and clearance invoices arrive and I will posted them as invoices). My goods are temporarily released from the port with the guarantee of the amount I pay until the customs and clearance procedure is completed.
Now, when the goods arrive at our warehouses, only the supplier’s invoice arrives with the goods, but the customs and clearance invoices are delayed (sometimes it may be delayed by more than 5 months), as until now I do not know how much the employee whom I gave the amount will pay the value as real fees, and because I want now to issue an invoice for the supplier, I release the invoice without the mentioned costs, and so that the system does not reduce the cost of the inventory. Is there any way to manually hide the PO from the GR/IR temporarily or a way to tell the system ignore this PO when clearing , until other actual cost invoices arrive, and then I can show it manually to clear GR/IR of this PO.
Note: Manual Control of final clearing it doesn't work when there're value differences between delivered and invoiced , it's only work for qty difference.
Thanks a lot and I apologize for the long explanation.

Hi Prathish
I believe you are running a business logic error, not a technical issue with the SOAP Message.
For example: 
3080961 - SAP Fiori: Tolerance check with maximum percentage rate
So i expect there is a tolerance check for the journal entry that is set and the value you have is above the tolerance limit so i requires some special authorization, etc.
I would suggest to check with your business colleagues about the tolerance limits. Otherwise you could find a journal entry with a lower value to test your SOAP logic.
Thank youJerry
I have a master recipe: 
I have an operation with 2 phases (011&012) and secondary resources are assigned to both phases. 
However, the confirmation is currently only on the phases and not on the secondary resources. “If I understand it correctly, these must be confirmed independently in the case of confirmation on phases”
The consequence of this is that the "operations" on the on the secondary resources remain in the system, although the order is actually considered completed from a business point of view.
Now the problem is that the activities of the secondary resources still remain in the PP/DS because they are not confirmed. Detailed scheduling heuristic runs over these activities and, due to the DS strategy, throws an error
Is it possible via. Customizing / BadI / User-Exit to ensure that when a phase is finally confirmed, the associated operations of the secondary resources can also be automatically confirmed? 
I would not consider milestone confirmation for now.

Hi to all!
I am not a SAP developer (not even a key user)
I came accross in a major issue at a project, where I have to replicate process of how in SAP price is calculated
Below you see a CaseA & CaseB calculation, which is has to do with how the flow of calculations are done, including the roundings
About 1 piece purchase I have

in case of 60 pieces 

does SAP calculates on total qty, and after does i.e NetValueOf_60pcs / 60 = Value After Discount ?
I would appriciate any help or reference.
Glad to send more info if necessary
Thanks in advance

Hi,
I have a business requirement which consists in having the possibility of making a scrapping of stock or sample consumption at the time of the decision on the inspection lot , I carried out the setting necessary in ewm and qm, however I did not have movement generated, I don't see what misses, could you say to me if there is a blog which details the steps?
I would also like to know if there is a way to transfer to a new material when taking the UD ?
Thanks

Hi,
as the Cloud Foundry environment on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) is managed by SAP, you cannot enable core CF features. But deploying an app with Docker image is a supported feature of Cloud Foundry environment on SAP BTP, see "Cloud Foundry Environment | SAP Help Portal - Supported and unsupported Cloud Foundry Features"

More details on the procedure you can find here: Deploy Docker Images in the Cloud Foundry Environment | SAP Help Portal or in this tutorial Understand the Cloud Foundry Application Lifecycle for Docker Applications | Tutorials for SAP Developers

Hi Team,
I am using the CR Runtime Engine (CR Runtime 13.0.23.2819) using the SQL Database (2014) and executing a SPROC to run reports. 
The .NET windows Application was working fine with TLS1.0 enabled, but when we disable TSL 1.0 and Enable TLS 1.2, the CR did not work with the SQLOLEDB Driver, so we upgraded the CR Runtime to (CR Runtime 13.0.31.4010) and Tried with the new driver installed MSOLEDBSQL19 Driver, it supported the TLS1.2, but some of the reports that has DateTime as one of the Parameter, it is not working and throwing a syntax error at the Convert function. Below is what we get when we trace the SQL request in the profiler. Browsed through lot of forums, but seems this latest driver is not supported by CR yet. Is that still holds true or is there any fix for the below ?
exec "ARxDb"."dbo"."SP_Name";1 CONVERT(DATETIME, '2022-03-24 13:56:03', 120), CONVERT(DATETIME, '2022-03-24 13:56:03', 120), '03770' (which is not a valid statement for executing the sproc)
Need to find the correct driver that supports both TLS 1.2 and also that does not throw the DateTime convert error.
Thanks in advance.
Sathish
The problem may be that the version of the SDK that you're using doesn't support MSOLEDBSQL19. You're using SP 23 of the SDK, which was released in May of 2019, and version 19 of MSOLEDBSQL was released in Feb 2022.
So, you have two options:
1. Upgrade your application so that it uses the latest version (SP 31) of the Crystal .NET SDK, then install the new runtime and deploy the upgraded application. This might require upgrading the version of .NET you're using.
2. Downgrade the version of the MSOLEDBSQL driver that you're using to 18.1 or 18.2.1 from here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/oledb/release-notes-for-oledb-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-2016#previous-releases. 
Option 2 might be the easier fix for now. However, SAP only supports the current version of the SDK, although it is still possible to download older versions back to SP23.
-Dell 
Yes you do need to upgrade to SP 32, releasing tomorrow:
Follow this WIKI:
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/Crystal+Reports%2C+Developer+for+Visual+Studio+Downloads
The other issue Microsoft updated their client dll name, for CR to be able to use the recent Clients you need to manually upgrade each report.
Open CR Designer, open your report, Click on Menu Database, Set Datasource Location.
In the new list of connection select OLE DB or ODBC and select the latest OLE DB Client from the list. If using ODBC then your DSN needs to be updated to also use the latest Client.
Unfortunately there is no mass update API that can update the report when saved. You can update the report to use the new connection info but it doesn't get saved, only works in the current session which is why you need to update the reports manually.
Use Google and search for this KBA - 2269180 - Disabling TLS 1.0 and 1.1 causes Crystal Reports and .NET application to fail to connect to MS SQL Server
It's older but should answer a few questions.... Using a MS Client that supports TLS 1.2 is Client side configuration only, other then updating the reports to recognise and use the updated client.

Hi,
In SAP IRPA automation
I'm sending a get request to my CAP service in one of my automation using 'CALL web service with destination'

in the first step I'm giving the parameters for the web service call
return { 'url': '/mrorequestdolphin/MaintenanceRequests?$filter=to_requestStatus_rStatusDesc eq \'Revision & Event Created\'', 'method': 'GET', headers: { 'Accept' : 'application/json', 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, 'responseType':'json', // parse the body of the result as a JSON object 'resolveBodyOnly':true // get only the body of the response}; 
Here in the url when we give '&' directly we are getting an error 'Bad Request'
So I have tried giving URI encoding of & '%26' 
although there is no error the query is not working as the response is blank.
Similarly I have tried using the method encodeURIComponent() but the result is same as before no response
Note: I have tried with other values in the URL without ampersand and the automation works fine and gives the desired result the problem arises when I tried using & in the URL 
Please help me in resolving this issue
Regards,
Did you try to encode only the & character or the whole url?I've had similar issues with trying to add an url as attachment to an invoice. I never managed to get past this encoding problem.
Hi,
I have observed that while creating RFQ (ME41) there is MPN field.
Our requirement was to have it while maintaining RFQ (ME47) when Vendor replies with their own Material Number, so we enter MPN too.
How to acheive that?
Hello SAP experts, 
I need some help with IF statement in Lunch Pad 4.3. I'm trying to create calculated column showing letter "G" if value is > 500. 
=if([object]>500, "G") - giving me ERROR - Problem converting '500,' to a float.

you need to use semicolon instead of comma in the formula.
=if([object]>500; “G”)
or another way to write if else statement
=if([Object]>500) then “G”
ZURAB LOBZHANIDZEThis should work, but make sure your object is a numeric type. If it is a string, you will need to convert it to a number first. Try using the following syntax:


Thank you both, I figures that value was string, so =If(ToNumber([object]) > 500; "G") works with semicolon.
when to use operator := in SAP HANA SQLScript. I am able to achieve the same same result using operator = . Please clarify.
I see that
Even though the := operator is still available, SAP recommends that you use only the = operator in defining scalar variables.
in the https://help.sap.com/docs/HANA_CLOUD_DATABASE/d1cb63c8dd8e4c35a0f18aef632687f0/66b38a60ab3b475f925c224038511c51.html?q=though
This recommendation goes back all the way to the latest in documentation for SAP HANA 1.0: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_PLATFORM/de2486ee947e43e684d39702027f8a94/66b38a60ab3b475f925c224038511c51.html?version=1.0.12, so this notation `:=` must be old enough that I did not even remember.

Hello, I would like to know if in Time Management it is possible to create a single time event type, to carry out paring times, for example9:00 am -> p01 clock in1:00 pm > p01 (for lunch)2:00 pm > p01 (back lunch)4:00 pm > p01 clock outOr is it a bad practice since, as time is fragmented, if the lunch check-out were to be missing, the system would not be able to identify the check-out, right?
What is required for SAP RFC? We are on the RISE package and it is front-end access I have we are planning to connect with textura a cloud oracle software with a windows server desktop on-premise connector.
You will also need to find out more details about this "Textura" product. Will it be sending RFC calls, or will it be receiving the calls? If it is written in C, Java or .NET and is "extensible", then you could plugin one of SAP's RFC Connectors, like NW RFC Lib for C/C++, SAP JCo for Java or SAP NCo for Microsoft .NET.
If it isn't extensible, you might need a middleware like SAP Business Connector, which can translate the data format/communication protocol used by Textura to SAP's RFC format.
A different idea: RISE is a cloud-based solution and therefore probably offers various options for communicating via HTTP and XML, SOAP or OData formats. If Textura also provides HTTP-based interfaces, it may be a better idea to use HTTP instead of RFC for the communication between RISE and Textura.
In any case, in order to give good advice here, we will need more technical details about this Textura system.
Hello Jonathan Brotto,
RFC function modules in an SAP system must be proper function modules and must be registered in the SAP system as remote. If the calling program and the called program are both ABAP programs, the RFC interface provides both communication partners.
For more details refer below SAP help link.
https://help.sap.com/saphelp_snc700_ehp01/helpdata/en/22/04250b488911d189490000e829fbbd/content.htm?no_cache=true#:~:text=RFC%20function%20modules%20in%20an,the%20SAP%20system%20as%20remote.&text=If%20the%20calling%20program%20and,interface%20provides%20both%20communication%20partners.

Hi All,
We are trying to do HTTS with client certificate based Authentication in sender Rest channel. The 3rd party system has provided their public certificate to us. we have proxy in between and our proxy team has configured the certificate at their end. We also mapped the certificate to a technical user in NWA and have done all the steps as per this blog. 
 The messages are reaching till proxy system successfully but from proxy to PI its giving 500 error. When we have the option "Perform Inbound HTTPS security checks" checked with HTTPS Security Level "HTTPS with Client Authentication" then we are getting the error. If the above option is unchecked the messages are entering into PI system. s there any step we are missing here? request you to help us resolving this issue? 
Thanks & Regards,

What are steps to be followed? 
Thanks very much in advance.

Hallo,
have anyone experience with Fiori Elements in combition with SAP CAP and draft models?My database schema looks like this:
than I have one service, who defines the entity "Mitarbeiter" as an draft model. In addition to that, i have several annotations defined for the ui. This works perfectly. Then I add (click on the create button on the ui) one entity called "Mitarbeiter", a post request is fired (correct).On this newly created entity "Mitarbeiter", I add another entity called "Adressen", again a post request is fired (correct). The newly created entity fires another request (get request for refreshing the entity). And in my opinion, this request is not correct. SAP Cap throws this error:

Fiori Elements don't hand over the key fields (sId=...,IsActiveEntity) for this one to one relationship. 

The backend, that is SAP CAP doesn't know, that the root entity "Mitarbeiter" is in in draft mode and is not existing in the database. 

If you can reproduce it in a small example I would suggest opening an issue. From my experience using localized & draft together I can remember quite a few bugs in the past.

Hello all,I am inside a form and I want to make one Checkbox that when checked, displays a Label with DateTimerPicker in the same page, right below the checkbox.
And if not checked, don't display anything. I have the check box and the label but can´t seem to make it work that way I described.Thanks in advance
Hello Gabriel, Try using binding for visible property on your DateTimePicker. Bind it to same property as your checkBox so when you check it it will go visible. If you need reversed logic use formatter or just use expression binding and reverse the value. Hope it will helpJ.K.
I'm trying to consume as service in S/4HANA from CPI via the Cloud Connector. In the receiver adapter the only authentication options available are

None
Basic
Principal Propagation

The first two options are no good for as our security team will not endorse those to methods. I can use principal propagation where I have a client (Sender) but I have a problem where the iFlow is started by a Timer event in CPI. In this scenario I have no Principal.
A sample scenario is CPI polls an SFTP site for Journal file produced by another system. It picks up this file and consumes the API in S/4HANA to post the Journal.
My question are:

Can I manually set a Principal in the iFlow
Can the Cloud Connector authenticate to S/4 on my behalf

It seems bizarre that the cloud connector is forcing me to use a less secure authentication method.
I can get secure certificate based authentication if I don't go via the cloud connector but this means I need to expose the S/4 API to the internet which is not ideal.
Hi Jon,
Please go through this blog post if it helps.
principal propagation in Cloud Connector
Regards,
Priyanka
Hi Jon, 
The Cloud Connector is actually a secure connection to the on-prem system which may explain why you do not need "extra" security. 
I'm assuming you have S/4 On-prem? Are APIs also exposed via a communication arrangement? If so, then only the Communication User can ever access the exposed endpoints (at least that is how it works in the Cloud.)
Kind regards,
Looks like the situation did not change. I do want to use Client Cert based authentication for my backend on-prem S4 systems.
Hi Team:
We are in middle of the Bonus cycle and we changed the currency conversion table instead of updating the existing table and now the Budget section is showing wrong values.
Is there a way to update the live Bonus forms in this scenario?
Appreciate any inputs on this.
Thank you.
Can you Try update all worksheets choosing the budget option.

Hi
Variable pay uses the currency conversion table to coordinate currency changes in the employee history, so I can imagine that you will need to run the calculate bonus process as well as the update worksheet process. Give this a try.

Hi Experts,
We are looking to synchronize MDGF Prod and MDGF Non-Prod environments. The approach we are looking is replicate staging tables from MDG Prod to MDG Non Prod environments and then from staging tables to non prod downstream systems, however I don't know if this is possible. 
Is this possible? If not, what would be the best approach for replicating from MDGF Prod to MDGF Non-Prod ?
Thanks.
Hi  CARLOS RODRIGUEZ VALENZUELA,
It sounds like an initial load scenario for your Non-Prod MDGF system; please have a look to this thread.
Thinking loud, SAP SLT could be also a solution for a table to table replication...I don't have any direct experience  within using it with the MDG-F staging tables but remember that the technical names of these tables change from system to system.
R.
In the service of making a business case for some warehouse automation robots, I need to figure out how much of the material we store would be eligible based on the robot’s size/weight limits, and the average receiving volume of those materials.
 I imagine an output with (essentially) 2 things: (1) the material numbers of all products that meet the given size/weight criteria (along with available weight and dimension data), and (2) how much of each of those materials we receive on an average day. 

 For context, I can also use a material’s storage location to filter out a percentage of what’s currently stored (if helpful). Additionally, there is a lot of material with null values for dimensions…so that doesn’t help. 

 What’s the best way to extract this information from SAP? I currently have the MARA table selection screen pulled up, but I could use some help identifying the relevant parameters to get the job done as efficiently as possible. 

 Thanks in advance!

Following is valid for UNX Universes only
If you already have SI_ID value for the folder you're looking into, then you can use a query such as:
SELECT SI_ID, SI_NAME FROM CI_APPOBJECTS WHERE CHILDREN("SI_NAME='Document-DSL.Universe'", "CHILDREN('SI_NAME=''Folder Hierarchy''', 'SI_ID=123456')")
Otherwise if you only have name of this folder, it will be just about adding a filter for this property:
SELECT SI_ID, SI_NAME FROM CI_APPOBJECTS WHERE CHILDREN("SI_NAME='Document-DSL.Universe'", "SI_KIND='WEBI' AND CHILDREN('SI_NAME=''Folder Hierarchy''', 'SI_KIND=''FOLDER'' AND SI_NAME=''Web Intelligence Samples''')")
Just be careful that this contains some double quotes and some repeated single quotes.Regards,Loic
The challenge with this is that universe names are not stored in the Webi reports, just the SI_ID value of the universe.  And, unfortunately, I haven't been able to find a QueryBuilder relationship that will work from Webi to Universe - just ones that go from a specific universe to its Webi reports.
In the past, I have written code that does this type of thing using both the Java and the .NET versions of the BI Platform SDK and exporting the data to a .csv file.  I think you could also do this using a combination of the BI Platform and Web Intelligence RESTful Web Services SDKs.
Or there are third-party tools that can get this information for you.

Hi Experts,
It may be a basic question, but still need help
While creating service PR from service activity, system taking account assignment category N.
Need help know how it is fetching? what are the config need to do?
i have checked in T code OPTT. here N is not there
J is picking up during material PR

I have checked in the forum and could not get the answer?
Thanks in advance
Venkat
1.  Looks like you have changed the standard configuration for Account Assignment Category so you will have to dig into your system to see why.  J is not used for PS in standard.  Did you just change the description or the settings?
2. In the PS05 control key it specifies that this Network Activity is an "externally processed operation" where a PR without a material master and charging the Network Activity will be created.  The costs from this PR/PO have to flow to the Network Activity and that is why you are getting account assignment N.
I believe the PR should also have Item Category D for service.

Dear colleagues:
Regarding the company structure, our current client, and I guess it may extend to many companies, complains that the company structure overview does not filter by location, so what is the point of creating a location object and attaching it to the legal entity if it is not going to appear there?
The THR81 guide mentions that the business unit is not geographic, so then,
At what point in the Standard Structure should you start separating by provinces/states (depending on the country) from division, perhaps department? The THR81 guide mentions that the business unit is not geographic.
What would be a perfect standard Structure according to what successfactors has in mind at the beginning for a company that exists in different countries (states and provinces)?
Thanks,
Regards.
Hello Adrian Galisteo Rivas,
Please refer below SAP Blog. Might be it's helps to you.

Confirm if it's works for you.

Neeraj Jain
So the perfect structure would be (and these would all be 1 to many in this order) is something like:Company --> (multiple possible under each Company) Business Unit --> (multiple possible under each Business Unit) Division --> (multiple possible under each Division) Department --> (multiple possible under each Department) Cost CenterThat way you basically cannot go wrong as its like an expanding funnel from an org chart point of view.The association for location is often rather done for filtering in job info / position, because then you have fewer locations to pick (as the earlier chosen company reduces it).In reality this often is not the case due to namings, stuff like sub departments, many to many relations (i.e. any business unit can belong to any legal entity) and organizations that have departments tied to different legal entities for instance. The org structure itself is more built based on views (so in principal you could due to your association create a location based view to sort of get the desired filtering). Keep in mind it's still something used by a broad audience, so therefore it always has some limitations. For that reason customers use addons like ingentis
Hi,
Iam Developing App in SAP WEB IDE.
When i click submit button, it is calling API and binding omodel to the table - Working fine
When i click post button, Im getting the data from table and sending as payload to Post API - Working fine
But, after some time/10 minutes API is throwing error called "<html><head><title>Error report</title></head><body><h1>HTTP Status 503 - No application is available to handle this request</h1></body></html>".
If I relaod again my app is working fine. 
Could you please help me how to handle above exception?

i think that is normal, that is you test run, it is probably timeout.

Hello Experts,
I am trying to post INVOIC idoc for an intercompany scenario. 
But unfortunately i am getting an error saying "Call transaction was canceled."
I checked all the field status variant for transaction FB01. Can you please help me in resolving this issue
Regards,
Asha Patil
Can you please list out in sequence what transactions were executed?  It is not clear as to why in Intercompany Billing, you were trying with FB01.  Normally, billing will happen in SD side.
The problem is reproducible in QAS, right?
Then why not process the IDOC in foreground and look for errors?
Debugging is also a feasible option in non-productive systems.
If the problem occurs only in PRD and not in QAS, then at least you can compare the settings, master data and transactional data between systems and try to reproduce the problem.
 @Asha Patil I am also facing same error while posting intercompany billing. 
Can you please provide the resolution?
Hi Asha,
Can you please provide the resolution we are also facing same issue during intercompany billing.

Hello,
In my last installations of SAP Hana I have seen that SAP Hana is behaving differently, though it is installing successfully. Of course there are Notes which offer a solution but I do not get why should this happen.
Firstly, when installing I am having issues about manifest and I have to use againsta the SAPCAR with some flag.
Secondly, the installer is not installing the resident hdblcm to the instance. I need to do a component update using the installation media. I do not recognize this if not needed at that moment. What if I would like to do this kind of update, do I need the exact installation media I used for the installation?
I do not understand what I am doing wrong. Any idea?
I use the IMDB_Server installation media which is suggested by maintenance planner, if it should make any difference. 
Hello All, 
In my Fiori List report application, I have added two buttons and a popover as extension. I have maintained texts for all of them in i18n file and provided an i18n_fr file for french texts. 
When I test the app in french locale, the french texts from sap library gets picketd up but my custom fields, it results in 404 error for _fr texts. Now, I tried to include the bundle url in the manifest.json settings(https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/ec753bc539d748f689e3ac814e129563) but to no avail. 
Is it a bug? or is it different in fiori elements. 

Hi Sharath,
We have faced the same kind of issue and it is resolved by adding the below details to the manifest and controller file
1. Add i18n reference as below in the sap.app section of the manifest
 "i18n": {
 "bundleName": "APPID.i18n.i18n",
 "supportedLocales": ["en", "fr"],
 "fallbackLocale": "en"
 }, 
 2. Define the i18n model like this in the manifest file
 "i18n": {
 "type": "sap.ui.model.resource.ResourceModel",
 "settings": {
 "bundleUrl": "i18n/i18n.properties",
 "supportedLocales": ["en", "fr"],
 "fallbackLocale": "en"
 } 
 }, 
3. Add i18n reference in onInit of your listreport & object page controller file like this
 var i18nModel = new sap.ui.model.resource.ResourceModel({ 
 bundleName: "APPID.i18n.i18n" }); 
 this.getView().setModel(i18nModel,"i18n");
Hope this helps.
Hi Sharath, 
Just checking - are your i18n files complete and cover the same text elements? From your network tab screenshot, I can see that it loaded the i18n_fr.properties at least once with status 200. Therefore I am assuming that it is loading it in this example, but in other cases it falls back to the other one. The erroring 404's could then have to do with the loading of control libraries which also require i18n and this would no longer be the case in a productive scenario. 
Did you try adding the below url parameter to your running app? 
You should be fine without the supportedLocales in your manifest.json as long as the i18n model is defined as per the default configuration that takes place when generating your app.

Hey guys,i want to specify the measure i enter in the function "Table_1.getNumberFormat().setDecimalPlaces(int, meas)". The measure input (meas) in the function should be an array of strings. I don't know what the array should look like, so that the function works on the measure i want.
I use the new model and my MeasureDimension is called "Amount_LC". I tried meas = ["Amount_LC"] and meas = ["@MeasureDimension : Amount_LC"], but that didn't work.Kind regards,Jan.

I am not sure of you actual requirement but you need to pass an array of type string containing the measures to Table_1.getNumberFormat().setDecimalPlaces() method. 
The array can be simply created like below also with comma separated measure names in case you have a fixed list. This will set decimal for the 2 measures.

Hi Bin,
Is this S/4HANA Cloud, or Hybrid cloud?
Have you looked at Best Practices Explorer - https://rapid.sap.com/bp/#/BP_CLD_ENTPR
Best,

I suggest to utilize the Feature Scope Description document you can find on SAP Help Portal on the product page for both S/4HANA Cloud and S/4HANA as a guide. You can also consider reviewing Product Roadmaps for future planned innovations - https://www.sap.com/products/roadmaps/finder-all.html
Best Practice Explorer Bob linked to is great source of information for what you can get activated out of the box for fit-to-standard workshops.

Hi,
our SAP B1 environment is like this:

1 SAP B1 Server (SLD is running on same server)
1 SQL database

We are running many addons (6 of them) and many users (35-40) on the same time. In addition there goes import of orders to SAP B1 via webservice from our ecommerce solution online.
Couple weeks ago started DI server service to crash - restart of service helps to keep it going.
I would like to create some load balancing for DI server. Question: can i install and run multiple SAP DI servers on the same time? My plan is to separate traffic from addons and ecommerce to DI servers. Of course, installation of SAP DI server number 2 will be processed on a separate server.
I know that DI server is 32 bit and it can use max 2 gb of RAM. Haven't measured performance yet, but i am planning to do that.
Thank you :)
p.s. tried to find SAP DI server tag for my question but couldn't find it... :)

Hi,
We are using Analysis for Office 2.7 and 2.8.
So far 2 users have the effect that they cannot use the mouse in the Prompt dialog, the buttons don't accept the mouse click. Keyboard entry is possible.
They use different versions of Analysis (one user 2.7, one user 2.8), but both have a two screen setup (two monitors connected to the PC).
After some testing, it works for them when they use a specific screen (one of the two) for the prompt.
I tried that on my system, but I can't reproduce this behavior. For me Analysis works on both screens.
I searched in OSS and here, but did not find a similar topic.
Does anyone have the same experience, or a hint / solution?
Thanks.
Edit 21.02.2023:With AO 2.8 SP17 we shipped an improvement in the DPI Handling which got documented with SAP Note 3248397 - AO: Multi Monitor & DPI environments - UI elements do not react when clicking on them.
This enables Per-Monitor DPI Awareness for the affected dialogs (like the Prompts) which should fix the issue and also improves the appearance of the dialogs in multi monitor & DPI scenarios.
After installing this version the workarounds I described become obsolete.
Please give it a try and let us know in case that you are still facing this issue (ideally via an SAP Incident).
Thanks & best regards,Patrik
Previous / Original answer:
Hi Matthias,
This sounds like it might be an DPI related issue (the dynamic DPI integration of Windows and Office are not really fully bullet proof yet).
Could you please check in the Display Settings if the monitors have different DPI values?

If that's the case, is the issue still reproducible when using the same DPI value for all monitors (e.g. 100% and don't forget to log off and on again after changing the value)?
Alternatively / additionally you can also check if changing the "when using multiple displays" mode in the Excel Settings helps (the best appearance mode already caused problems in the past due to an bug in the dynamic DPI integration in Excel).

Please let us know the result as this could help us to investigate the root cause of the issue. 
Thanks & best regards,Patrik

I'm working on a mock server where one of the fields of an entity in the metadata is defined as
<Property Name="createdOn" Type="Edm.DateTimeOffset" Nullable="false"/>
The createdOn field is given a value like this in the json file
"createdOn": "/Date(1676891893000+0000)/"
I'm binding this field to a cell in the table and have also defined a formatter
<Text text="{path: 'createTimeForm>createdOn', formatter: '.timeFormFormatter.formatDate2'}"/>
In the formatter function, I'm getting the date as a string instead of a date object.

The dDate parameter should have contained a date object.
Note: I'm working with OData V4.

The error message indicates a configuration error with cds.requires.db. However, in your package.json file, you have set "multitenancy": true and "extensibility": false. Since this is an extension application, my best guess is that you do not need to use a database so that you can remove "cds.requires.db" from the "requires" section of your cds configuration.
Hi Ranjith kumar,
Thanks for the clarification.  I don't think what you are trying to implement can be achieved with out-of-the-box CAP multi-tenancy.  If you review the CAP Multi-tenant SaaS documentation,  you will see that a database is a core part of the architecture.  This makes sense because with multi-tenant CAP you must define a domain model for generation of backend services which interact with the corresponding DB tenant (HDI Container) to ensure data isolation.  This is all automatic with CAP because it is tightly integrated with SAP HANA Cloud.  There is also a PostgreSQL adapter for CAP.  Since there is no such adapter for SuccessFactors MDF and nor do I think it would be practical to develop one, I suggest a more compatible architectural approach would be as follows:1)  Implement your SuccessFactors extension as a standard CAP multi-tenant SaaS application with SAP HANA Cloud DB to store the minimal required configuration information for each tenant.
2)  Deploy your domain model in each SuccessFactors "tenant" using MDF and expose such objects as OData services (APIs).  With this approach you would need to come up with a mechanism to deploy the extension application's domain model automatically to SuccessFactors MDF as part of the onboarding process for each subscriber.
3)  Provide a configuration UI in your extension application that allows the administrator of a particular tenant subscription to integrate with the corresponding SuccessFactors MDF OData services created in Step 2, using Destinations.A "keeping the core clean" approach would be to use SAP HANA Cloud to persist the extension data instead of storing in MDF.  The only integration with SuccessFactors would be via the standard public APIs if needed.  What is the reason you prefer to persist the extension data in SuccessFactors MDF?  The only reason I can think of is maybe it could make combined reporting across custom and standard objects a little easier.
I hope the above makes sense.

Mustafa.
Hello,we have build a story in SAP Analytics Cloud based on a BW on Hana-live-model.In the story we have tables as well als diagrams. The strange thing is, that obviously you can choose wether you want to see the short-/medium-/longtext of the dimension "salesmanager" in a table, but you cannot choose this when using excatly the same BW-live-model and the same dimension in a diagram? Is that really true?And what would be the workaround? My only idea is using an import-model with the same BW-query as you can chose wheter to import short-/medium-/longtext from the query - and then also use it in the diagram. But that is not really nice as you have to creat the import-model then espacially for that one diagram in the story. Obviously it also does not help to change in the BW-query, wether the query shows longtext oder shorttext for the dimension "salesmanager". That makes a difference on BW-side, but obviously not on SAC-side when using a BW-live-model?Thanks a lot!User-dialogue for "Salesmanager" in a table in SAC-story:. Here you can switch to longtext:

User-dialog for "Salesmanager" in a diagram in SAC-story with no possibility to switch to longtext:

Martin Barth
Currently This looks like product limitation for other widgets than table. 

2644779 - Text output format cannot be changed in SAP Analytics Cloud - SAP ONE Support Launchpad
3233034 - BW query settings for Text output format, are not reflecting in SAP Analytics Cloud - SAP ONE Support Launchpad
But as per the roadmap this is possible in Optimized Design mode of the story.

Hope this helps !!
Please upvote/accept if this helps
Nikhil
Thanks a lot for your input, Nikhil!So this feature should already have been released in Q3/2022 SAC release with the optimized story experience?I had a short try with an existing story and converted it to the optimized view and design mode, but I am still facing the same problem and I cannot chose the longtext for the dimension in a chart :-(But: The SAC tells me when switching to the optimized design experience, that the BW behind the live connection is outdated and needs some updates. => So is there an update on the BW on HANA necessary to get the longtext in the SAC?Or was this particular feature not yet released in Q3/2022 and is still waiting? Do you have or anyone else have any experience on that?Thanks a lot and best regards!Martin
Hello Martin,
we "solved" this problem by changing the setting for "Respect text presentations that are defined at the BW query level". You can find it in the system configurations (administration -> system configuration). 

You have to check your existing stories after this change. Probably you have to do some adjustments.
After changing the setting you can choose your required text field at query level in backend.
Hello Iris,thanks a lot for your answer! :-)That sounds like a great solution for me and I did not know that so far.I am still waiting for the feedback of a colleague, who built some dashboards with BW live queries, before switching the toggle, but we will definitivley try this!
My functional objective is to implement a real-time planning scenario between SAC and DWC. The storage and source model are in DWC, and the planning screen is in SAC.
I have an issue with creating the remote table (required for real-time). 
The details: 
Step 1: OK: Transfer of data from the table source to DWC.
In DWC :
o Create the view by checking "Expose for Consumption" 
o Retrieve the OData URL "assetRelationalDataUrl"
In SAC: 
o Create the OData API and configure it with the URL
o Create the model by replication 
 o Transfer the data in FULL
Step 2: OK: Entering and publishing data in SAC.
Step 3:KO: Transfer the entered data in Delta.
Why in Delta? Because I do not want to transfer the entire dataset each time data is entered, but only the modified data. 
Create the remote table : When I tried to retrieve the SAC planning view by expanding the model ID, I received a "getChildrenFailed" error in DWC that prevents the visualization of the models on SAC.

Hello,
 I have been having issues with SAP GUI lately. I am on GUI version 770 patch 8. I have following situations going on. 
1. The F1 help on fields shows a blank screen. Sometimes the whole screen goes black. 
2. In the code editor the code completion shows options but its not transforming in the code. I am not able to chose any of the options. 
3. Pretty printer moves the cursor away from editor to the menus at the top . The cursor has to be moved back via mouse. 
I have tried to install the GUI again after full uninstall but no luck. I am on Windows 10.

Hello Experts,
In my project, I would like to create context-sensitive help functionality to guide the user throughout the application. I am using the SAP Launchpad implemented from BTP through the Build Work Zone application together with a large number of both Fiori Elements and freestyle applications built using SAP CAP. Ideally, this would be implemented as a collapsable sidebar similar to what is shown for S/4HANA in this blog post. My questions are basically these two: 

Is there functionality similar to SAP Web Assistant available when using BTP, Build Work Zone and Fiori Elements/freestyle sapui5 applications?
If not, is there some way to add a dynamic sidebar to the content area of a launchpad app? Perhaps initally loaded from a launchpad Plugin? 

Any help would be much appreciated!
Best Regards,
Jibbril
SAP Enable Now companion (also known as web assistant) is available for the BTP workzone Launchpad. It comes with integrated configuration you have to setup. See sap help: https://help.sap.com/docs/WZ_STD/8c8e1958338140699bd4811b37b82ece/8f77268d2a954de48a8e3570a685b835.html
There's a requirement on my project to be able to save logs for any read access done in backoffice of an employee. Anytime they access a record, it needs to be audited.For example, employee "bob" enters backoffice and reads from the Product table, product with code "ABCD". Is there a way to be able to log that event? "bobs reads product ABCD"I tried using a LoadInterceptor on Item type, but that causes a bunch of issues and infinite loops when trying to log the current user who's accessing the item.
Hi Experts,
I have imported the Utilities industry standard content to SAP Analytics for Cloud. The SAP_UTL_Dashboard > Finance story, few charts show as "No data is available for the chart to render". This is because of the SAP__FI_GEN_IM_GENERALLEDGER model is connected to S/4 HANA. The help document (page 15) says "The CDS query 2CCFIAP_DPO is currently not in released state. The current timeline for the release of this CDS query is 201805".
Is there a workaround to upload sample data to the model, without the live connection?

Thanks,
Rohit

Rohit - yes, I have done this before. I recommend downloading the business content documentation and creating an Excel file that matches the SAP Analytics Cloud model and then you can import the Excel file and map it to the SAP Analytics Cloud model. It will take some work but it is possible; I have done this before with the SAP Analytics Cloud Solution Manager models.
Hello Experts,
I have updated the Month descriptions in IBP Test tenant via Data Integration jobs. Then the time profile was transported to production system & I activated the planning area. However, after the transport I do not see the updated Month descriptions in production system. The TR was imported successfully, still I see this issue. Any suggestions what can be the possible cause?
Regards,
AB
Hello Argha
Please re-upload time profile data in production tenant, as this is a data related change, descriptions wont be updated automatically
Thanks and Regards
Raghunath
Hello Argha,
The transport only transfers the configuration of the object, not the data.  As Raghunath said, you will need to upload the time profile data in the production tenant.  If the data in the time profiles are the same between systems, you can upload the data used in the non-prod system, but the time periods and time period IDs have to be the same otherwise you run the risk of changing the time periods that key figures appear in.  If the data in the two time profiles is different in any way, you will have to export the existing data from the time profile in production, edit the csv file for the month descriptions, and then re-upload that file.
Kind regards,Chris

Hi Luiz,
It is being recommended to not use the cloud connector version 2.13.1
Do you see any challenges in using the latest cloud connector version?

Thanks for the confirmation. With this, I can only conclude that the cleanup of connectivity proxy was not clean in the past. Once all the components, stateful set are recreated, it started using the correct credentials.
Hi,
I have a requirement where I need to create a non persistence entity that combines information from others persistence entities, and I want to create a valueList help using this non persistence entity, and I used the annotation @Common with valueList and in the collection Path I have the name of my non persistence entity.
when I call the value help in my Fiori application, the corresponding READ handler that I have implement is called and the values are return, but in the screen my search help it is not displaying the data. 
If I use an entity that is persistent the search help is woking without any problem,
any advice will be much appreciatted!
Tatiana 
Can you check in the network trace of the browser that you receive the result of your service correctly?
I think that the structure of the json objects in the returning array are not correct. It needs to have the exact same structure as the entity defined in the cds file.
you cannot create a view for the nonpersist entity? you must do application coding to fetch data for that entity?
Hi all,
I was able to solve the issue, updating the count value in my READ data handler.
if there are better ways to do this please let me know.
and again thanks for the help
I am implementing an application which displays a select dialog. The select dialog has lots of entries, therefore not all items are displayed imediatelly. The user needs to search for his items and needs to select them individually. After the selection I want to display the selected Items in a multi combobox. 
At first I got the selected items via the getSelectedItems method, but since I have more items now and the user needs to filter this does not work anymore. When I look into the documentation I can see that for these usecases you need to user the selectedContext Parameter (sap.m.SelectDialog - API Reference - Demo Kit - SAPUI5 SDK (ondemand.com))
Unfortunately, when I use this (like explained in the documentation, I get the error: Unsupported operation: v4.ODataModel#getContext
This does seem like a bug to me or is this intended? 
Does somebody know how I can get the selected values of a select dialog where the user can filter the elements? 
I think that the getSelectedItems should work even with a filter but rememberSelections should be true. Have you tried that?
Benjamin Seeger
Can you put a debugger and get the List aggregation and then check selected Context . If you are able to get it I think you should be good to go.I was getting same in case of table dialog . I took the table selected context property and then uses that to get the key and description. and the create token and set it to the multiInput.
And as Wouter Lemaire suggested add remember selection as true.
Let me know if this works for you .
I am trying out the reverse case also of taking tokens from MultiInput and setting it back to Dialog for my project. 
Good morning, 
I've been having a hard time for several days figuring out how to make a script that connects to a server using SNC from the SAP Logon start page. After that i think i will use the GUI script recording option to complete my script.
I couldn't find any official documentation on it so i refered myself on forum posts but none have been helpful so far.
I managed to launch the application via a VB script and attempt a connection with OpenConnectionByConnectionString() but it won't go through and tells me after a minute that the "Sapgui component could not be instantiated" with an error code 800A025D.
Here is my code that is inspired by another post on this forum;

Hi
We have had our EC module in place for some time and it's coming up to the time we need to think about purging inactive Employee data, however we're not sure the best practice for this.
Just wondering if anyone has any advice or help that we could use to decide the best cause of action for our business? Also, any references to blog or KBA's would be much appreciated.
Thanks
I think you're looking more at the approach side than how do I purge (which I think Neeraj just shared).The problem is that purging is rather subject to your GDPR regulations (so your Data Privacy Officer should be involved to see what is sensitive data and how long that can be stored) + align it with what the system can and cannot purge (as there are restrictions with regards to how often and what data). That is a bit of a time consuming exercise as you need someone to tell about the system and data to guide this person. Based on the outcomes of that discussion you could then set up the data retention rules.From a technical standpoint there is nothing that forces you to purge (other than perhaps the candidates / applicants requesting this in the Recruitment module). Some standard things we do observe are i.e. keeping resumes for an application for up to 30 days, keeping PMGM data for 2 years and keeping core HR data for max 5 years and aligning that with quite some of the other modules (as purging in EC may start a chain of anonymisation), but in the end all those examples don't matter as from a GDPR point of view as an organisation you MUST justify what data, what time frames and for what reasons is to be purged (which differs per company/country and sometimes even on lower levels like states).

Hi Experts, 
Please note TR sequence below. Both TR1/TR2 contains same smartform. 
TR1 - from dev system released in sep - Moved into test in Jan
TR2 - from dev system released in Dec - Moved into test in Dec
Issue was TR1 moved late in Jan, it actually wiped changes of TR2 in test system. so decided TR2 changes will be done again by another TR3 later to match with Test system. 
Now TR1 is ready to implement in Prod in Feb. But not TR2. Please note sequence mentioned above. So question is 
1)Can only TR1 go into prod without carrying changes from TR2? Will TR1 carry TR2 changes to Prod because late in importing? 
2)My concern is when TR2/TR3 will be move together later, will it affect or wipe out any TR1 changes? Can TR2 can go together later without affecting TR1 changes? 
When you releasead TR1 from DEV on sep, a set of files were created on the DEV file system. This set of files contains the objects you changed or you said to include on the TR. Even if you make changes to the same objects, that TR set of files never changes again, it's like a photograph of those objects on that particular moment of time.
Question 1) When you transport TR1 to PROD, only TR1 objects versions matters. TR1 doesn't know nothing about TR2 or TR3. The way you choose to transport orders in TEST doesn't change anything on their content.
Question 2) From your description, TR2 and TR1 both have same objects because you said that TR1 imported wiped out TR2 changes. So if you import them with the same order as they were released, you will end up with the same state as they are currently on DEV. 
Right, but there is nothing that you can do about it unless restore the QAS database to the state prior to the TR import and do the transport on the proper sequence...
From what you have described TR2 should already include the changes that were done in TR1 because it was generated after TR1 was released from the development system but involved the same objects (unless someone specifically reversed those changes in TR2).  Simply re-import TR2 into your quality environment to test and verify that it includes changes from both and proceed.

I'm looking for the SAP Best Practices to connect SAP Cloud Integration with S4Hana On Premise 2022 to apply in a green field implementation project. In this project we will have about 20 integrations.
This is my first time working with Cloud Integration. I'm used to using PI/PO with SPROXY but in my search almost all sites/blogs/tutorials recommend to use SOAMANAGER in ERP side to communicate with Cloud Integration. Is this the best way recommended by SAP? For me this seems like a step backwards compared to the PI/PO way.
Hi Leandro,
You can certainly still use the XI protocol for connection from the back-end to CPI.  I have a single RFC destination in our environment for handling all outbound proxy interfaces.  It is a bit more challenging to get the proxy content created since we do not have an ESR, but you can surely still use XI.  I have happened across some other content around generating proxy interfaces with MDR but haven't had a chance to look into it yet.

Ryan Crosby
Hello, I'm working on a report that contains multiple sub-reports.
One of the sub-reports is suppressing a record that is the same as another record.
The "Select Distinct Records" is defaulted to checked (it is selected) and greyed out. I am unable to change it.
The main report has an ODBC connection to the database.
Any suggestions?
Thanks
Hi,
I think unless you use direct tables (like using command object for query, direct view or stored procedure), the option "Select Distinct Records" will be grayed out. 
This might be because, in command object itself we can use distinct clause to select distinct records and hence, we don't need that option enabled.
And in your case (where you don't see the duplicated record), it might be possible that, the record itself might be getting omitted through the join conditions you have used at the query level. Check your query and see if outer join on the table where the required record is not getting retrieved might help.
Thanks,
Raghavendra
And the connection type in the main report is not really related to what the subreport is doing.  The main report just passes parameter values to the subreports.

Hi Team,
 Currently we are working on hybris upgrade from 6.1 to 2105.As part of this We are doing DB migration from Oracle to MSSQL server.  We have already tried to do the data migration from 6.1 oracle DB to new MSSQL DB. But we got type system issues. So now we are doing the data migration from upgraded 2105 Oracle to 2105 initialized MSSQL server DB using AWS DMS tool.  I have few doubts here, need your help to proceed further with the migration.  1.I have identified few changes in columns. For example in units table we have ACTIVEFLAG column in Oracle but in MSSQL server we have p_active column.  2.DO we need to change the column name to ACTIVE FLAG in MSSQL server when doing the data migration because as part of migration we also migrate composed types and attribute descriptors tables where we get ACTIVEFLAG column name in attribute descriptors and if we keep p_active column, system will not identify this column.  3.If we migrate composed types and attribute descriptors, will hybris identify the new type system while doing the system update?  4.First we migrated all tables without migrating composed types and attribute descriptors but I can see some issues while fetching the data from HAC as it is triggering the query on TypePKstring of each table which is PK of composed types. As you know the TypePKString in a table is a PK in composed types. Due to the difference in PK I am getting no results in HAC.  Please help me to clarify the above points asap.  Thanks, Sharada
Hi Sharada 
Please check my recent answer in blog below :
https://answers.sap.com/questions/13800885/issues-after-db-migration-from-oracle-to-mssql-ser.html?childToView=13804342
Your data types including primary keys and referential integrity should be matched with your Target DB in this case MSSQL Initialization empty tables before importing data from Oracle. Normally primary key and Foreign keys stay same but your data type will follow MSSQL data types otherwise Hybris can not distinguish the records if the data type is different from what Hybris expected in Target DB.
Some thoughts:
Thanks,
Hi Sharada,
Here is my answers:
1.As you suggested that we can use CMT for data migrations but not sure how to setup that.: The detail instruction is in :
https://github.com/SAP-samples/commerce-migration-toolkit2.And do we need CCV2 subscription to utilize/setup CMT tool? NO id an open Source3.If we want to use CMT tool for data migration, what is the procedure we need to follow? Just follow the GitHub instruction please4.Will SAP help us to setup the environment for data migration via CMT tool? This a free tools SAP provide for Hybris Customers if you need to get any support you need purchase or contact SAP ecommerce :
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_COMMERCE_CLOUD_PUBLIC_CLOUD/265a2902eb8d41a3bf79c5e5320785fa/497d536ea6d2485ab65e0f570d84e50e.html5.Is it paid services if we need to take help from SAP expert services to setup the environment for CMT tool? You can do migration by using this tool if you can follow the instruction with you hands on
Hope this helps,

Dear all,
I try to use Eclipse to correct Quick fixes. But when I do Run ATC on a package, I do not have access to Quick fixe.
We are migrating from ECC to S4H.
When I go to ATC transaction to create a run I do not have Quick fixes option. Do we need to have Quick fixes activated in SAP server to be able to use them in Eclipse?
The system is SAP_BASIS 740 then we are not able to use SAP Note 3000103 - ATC: Visibility of Parameter "Calculate Quick Fix Proposals" (SAP_BASIS 753 to 755). 
Thanks for your help.

Hi,
Crystal reports 8.5 version is very outdated, and I think it won't be available for download atleast from official SAP website.
May be someone from SAP can provide more information on this.
Thanks,
Raghavendra
Hi Kamil,
Like Don Williams confirmed, Crystal reports 8.5 is out of support for 20 years and literally not possible to get it from SAP or even if you get it from someone, it may not be compatible with the latest versions of Operating Systems.
As Crystal Reports 8.5 had a standalone query builder (unlike the command object we have now to write custom queries for report data), even migrating those to newer version may not be straight forward and may have to re-work on those reports.
Thanks,
Raghavendra
And, since the internal structure of the .rpt file changed with Crystal 9, reports that have been updated in a newer version will not run in 8.5 or applications that use the 8.5 SDK.

Is there a list of SAP BTP capabilities and products available?
For example document extraction, Advance financial closing some of them cannot find detail about some of products.
Hi ZFCG CFTZ,
The source of information for all services that are available on BTP will be the BTP Discovery Center:
https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/viewServices
Document Information Extraction is available in two forms:
1) As a single service with UI:
https://help.sap.com/docs/DOCUMENT_INFORMATION_EXTRACTION/5fa7265b9ff64d73bac7cec61ee55ae6/dc933b03badd406086fd1dee7708cc9d.html?locale=en-US
2) As a functionality that is available on top of the SAP Build - Process Automation:
https://help.sap.com/docs/IRPA/8e71b41b9ea043c8bccee01a10d6ba72/b911099cac4f4520a7780fd97658a476.html?locale=en-US
AFC has two releases: one for S/4HANA Cloud and the other is a Standalone version running on BTP. The later is using BTP and its services to implement the function and features as a Tenant for each SAP customer. Therefore, you won't find it on the Service Catalog as it is actually a SaaS solution running on BTP.
lease read the following blog to figure out where you stand (either S/4HANA Cloud or on BTP as a Standalone):

In one job I am having multiple WFs and all are generating different .csv files and on same job I have to create a trigger .
Please help me with this in availability and trigger development.
Thanks in advance.
I noticed that FSM is only available for service orders in S/4 Hana Public Cloud and not for the Asset Management orders (PM orders). When checking the road map i did not find any plan in the future. Is this on your roadmap but not published yet or did i overlooked this topic?

Hello Experts,
After Onboarding is initiated, an email notification goes out to the the HR to review the Offboardee information. Once the review is done, the employee(offboardee) also gets an email notification to review his or her data.
After the employee is done with his part of the review, the Offboarding tasks (like announce termination to coworkers, write farewell messages, schedule offboarding meetings etc) is triggered to the manager.
Although the tasks shows on the manager's homepage, he does not get any email notification of the tasks being triggered.
I can't seem to find any email template in email services to trigger this notification. I need some help on any custom notification template for this requirement.
I will glad to receive help and some answers.

By following this KBA How to add/update the learning event history using the import tool?
I find it very difficult to update the user´s completion status on an item, when uploading the file, it always say FAILED,
What I dont understand about the KBA is, it is explain how to update learning events but look at the message:
The following cannot be updated: userid, completion status,date and time.... so, this way is to update learning events but when doing it you got an error advising that NONE os the fields can be updated? 
I´m confused about this, can you help? or how to update completion status on bulk? using the "manage assignment" takes ages,

 
Thanks a lot! Have you all a great day ahead!
Dear Rocio Vazquez,
Would the "Add to Learning History for Multiple Courses" not be an option for you? Did you try it already?

This tool is heavily used by customer for mass completion.
Thank you.

Hi Karen Perez 
Thanks but the idea is to set as complete a large list of users/courses with different date of completion, by using "Add to Learning History for Multiple Courses", it is a hard manual work to be updated manually each user/course completion,
Any thought?
Thanks in advance,
Rocio
Thanks Karen Perez , it was just a matter of choosing "add" + editing the correct date/time format on file, simple thing but it took me a couple of hours :)
Obrigada!
Hi,
While creating a Decision Diagram using DMN, is it possible to create a new variable which takes a dynamic value? Example: a variable called TurnAroundTime which takes a value that is dynamically updated in a process Intelligence widget created for calculating TurnAroundTime.
Regards
Abhi
Hi Abhi,
I am afraid that's not possible right now (although it sounds like an interesting use case!).
The only way of connecting Process Intelligence widget values to diagrams is the Live Insights feature, but this one only works for BPMN diagrams, not for DMN.

Hi Gurus,
Is it possible to change icon’s color in Personas? I don’t see icon color in the list of properties. I have a title box with dark blue color and want to make the icon’s color inside this box white for effect; is this possible?
Thank you
Hi Tamas,
I've a basic title bar which consists of label with dark blue color in background RGB (53, 74, 95) and white font, beside the label there is a button where I want to assign an icon from ui5 icon library like below

Since the background color of the button is dark blue (same as label), I want the icon color to be white as well but I can't change the icon color and icon kind of blend in with the background color since the icon color is blue as well, please see below

In the openSAP course "Adapting the UI in SAP S/4HANA Cloud Using SAP Screen Personas", week 2, unit 5, at 3:20 , there's a quick style being applied to the button which changes the icon color (and the text beside) to appear in white font. I'm looking for this style to apply in my scenario. Is this quick style available in a standard system or is this something that you've built?
Thank you. 
Hi,
Currently, have an option to use SAPUI5 icon fonts in Slipstream engine. For the icon only buttons, we can even customize the size of the icons using iconFontSize property. 
We have noted down your requirement and would provide an option as a property to easily customize the SAPUI5 icons color.
No. If you need a different icon color, you need to create another icon that has the image with the intended color.
But perhaps I misunderstand what you want to do, so an example with screen shots would help.
Hi Experts,
I'm trying to use the source from my local file.
Here is what I did.
I go to this link (https://sapui5.netweaver.ondemand.com/1.73.1/resources/sap-ui-core.js)Copy and paste the code then saved to my sap_resources folder and name it as sap-ui-core1_73_1.js
Then I tried to change the path of my src on my index.html.
Why It does not work? It only show white screen or blank screen.
Here is my code
<script id="sap-ui-bootstrap"<br>  src="sap_resources/sap-ui-core1_73_1.js"<br>  data-sap-ui-libs="sap.ui.core, sap.m, sap.ui.table, sap.ui.commons, sap.ui.vbm"<br>  data-sap-ui-theme="sap_belize"<br>  data-sap-ui-appCacheBuster="./"></script>
But it doesn't work.I already tried to store the code of sap ui core js to TMD and TMQ
<script id="sap-ui-bootstrap" <br> src="tmd.sampleurl.com/sap_ui_core1_73_1/resources/sap-ui-core.js"<br>  data-sap-ui-libs="sap.ui.core, sap.m, sap.ui.table, sap.ui.commons, sap.ui.vbm"<br>  data-sap-ui-theme="sap_belize"<br>  data-sap-ui-appCacheBuster="./"></script>
and it showing white screen.I also tried like this so the code will change it dynamicall
<script><br> var script = document.createelement('script');<br> if(windows.location.href.index('TMD') != 0)<br> {
   script.setAttribute('src', 'tmd.sampleurl.com/sap_ui_core1_73_1/resources/sap-ui-core.js');
 }
 if(windows.location.href.index('TMQ') != 0)<br> { <br>   script.setAttribute('src', 'tmq.sampleurl.com/sap_ui_core1_73_1/resources/sap-ui-core.js');<br> }<br> script.setAttribute('id', 'sap-ui-bootstrap);<br> script.setAttribute('data-sap-ui-libs', 'sap.ui.core, sap.m, sap.ui.table, sap.ui.commons, sap.ui.vbm'); <br> script.setAttribute('data-sap-ui-theme', 'sap_belize');<br> script.setAttribute('data-sap-ui-appCacheBuster', './');
 document.head.appendChild(script);<br></script>
Even if it would work what you plan, I advise against it. 
First of all, SAPUI5 may only be used within the license agreement of the respective SAP product. So if you want to run a SAPUI5 app from an SAP onPremise system, you rely on the SAPUI5 available for this SAP onPremise system and  must not bootstrap SAPUI5 from CDN. See SAP Note 2943781 for further information. So, what you are trying to do cannot be achieved legally.
Secondly, SAPUI5 1.73 was only an interim-version and is out of maintenance since more than two years already. I would never run an app productively with such an outdated version. And as this version is out of maintenance since more than a year, also its cloud provisioning ended. See SAP Note 3001696 for further information about the deletion of outdated SAPUI5 versions. This means that this version is about to be deleted from the SAPUI5 CND. So the link (https://sapui5.netweaver.ondemand.com/1.73.1/resources/sap-ui-core.js) will point to nothing in a near future. In fact, it is a lucky coincidence that it is not deleted already. But from internal resources I can tell that this version will be irrevocably removed beginning of April '23. So, I really recommend to update your system and also your app to a current version of SAPUI5.
forget about it, you have no chance to make it work.
I'm trying to send data to SuccessFactors using iFlow: iFlow consists of: Timer, Content Modifier, Requist replay using SuccessFactors Adapter with OData V2 protokol. End, Mail, Receiver.

This is a format error, xml and json. how to solve this?

Thanks
Hi Khaled Kalo,
The error message is clear to me. You are sending a payload string that starts with character '{' - which probably means you are sending it in JSON format. Whereas the service API on the SF side is expecting the payload in XML format.
Check that you can actually use a JSON formated version of the SF API and change the endpoint accordingly.  I am pretty sure that SF has various APIs that do work with the OData Protocol - which means they will accept the JSON formatted payload.
If the only option use a SOAP API, then you would have to convert the payload from JSON to xml - as all SOAP APIs will only work with that kind of payload.
Maybe the following blog could also help you with some missing steps on how to consume the OData API in a Cloud Integration Flow. 
Hope this helps.

Hi Experts,
we are having a requirement where we need to refresh data into the data into the table at certain time interval and data is huge in number (~20K) record each time. 
we have tried to insert data into table using Repeater and it takes around ~1 hour to insert 10K records into the SQL table so checking if there is any other way where we can achieve it in optimized time.
Any suggestion on this requirement will be helpful.

I have adapted this example and it seems to work correctly when there is no error (duh!).
Problem is, when WS_DELIVERY_UPDATE_2 goes belly up the error message is displayed in the bar and that's a big no-no for my use case in a handheld scanner. I even tried this suggestion from Jelena Perfiljeva although this system is probably way more recent than the comment. 
Maybe I am doing something else wrong, but neither space nor abap_false have any effect here: HUGENERAL 075 is still being displayed in the bar.

The invocation of the function is as follows:
    CALL FUNCTION 'WS_DELIVERY_UPDATE_2'      EXPORTING        vbkok_wa               = ls_vbkok_wa        delivery               = pi_vbeln        update_picking         = abap_true        no_messages_update_1   = abap_true        synchron               = abap_true        commit                 = ' '        nicht_sperren_1        = 'Y'        if_database_update_1   = '1'        if_error_messages_send = space      TABLES        prot                   = lt_prot        verko_tab              = lt_verko        verpo_tab              = lt_verpo.

Hello All,
Has anyone tried Disable and Enable the CIG in Ariba P2P realm(Manage-->Core Admin-->Integration Manager-->Manage Cloud Integration Gateway)? For some of the CIG Connection issues, a few of the Ariba Connect FAQs mentioned about disable and enable option in CIG which can resynch connections.
I wanted to check with you all, if anyone has tried doing this? If we disable an already running CIG, do we need to take any backup? if so what details should we take as backup (The CIG Webservice Tasks?), After Disable and Enable, are we able to restore all the connections and mapping as it was earlier or are there any manual activities that we need to perform after enabling CIG.
Thanks,Velu
Hi Velayudham Vali, 
 
Before disabling it take the screen shot of configured webservice then disable it. So that when you will enable you should know what was configured before.
Do this activity out of office hour so the transaction will not get impacted. 
Also when you do the toggle make sure that CIG and Ariba/ Ariba network all are on sync. means all should be multiERP or single ERP as per your configuration.
You can try Disable/Enable CIG from Buying, what this will do is re-link your Buying realm to CIG side and confirm the integrations you are checking as recommended by Shika
Hello,
We have created an Fiori application where we have added two i18n properties one for English Language and another one for French Language. When we run the application locally from Business Application Studio and change browser language to French, Application is able to translate it in to French Language as expected and vice versa. But when we deploy that application to Fiori launchpad and change browser language to French it is not picking up the translable text from that French i18n file.
Need help in this.
Hi Sharath,
We were able to resolve this issue by adding the below details to the manifest and controller file
1. Add i18n reference as below in the sap.app section of the manifest
 "i18n": {
 "bundleName": "APPID.i18n.i18n",
 "supportedLocales": ["en", "fr"],
 "fallbackLocale": "en"
 }, 
 2. Define the i18n model like this in the manifest file
 "i18n": {
 "type": "sap.ui.model.resource.ResourceModel",
 "settings": {
 "bundleUrl": "i18n/i18n.properties",
 "supportedLocales": ["en", "fr"],
 "fallbackLocale": "en"
 } 
 }, 
3. Add i18n reference in onInit of your listreport & object page controller file like this
 var i18nModel = new sap.ui.model.resource.ResourceModel({ 
 bundleName: "APPID.i18n.i18n" }); 
 this.getView().setModel(i18nModel,"i18n");
I hope this helps.
Hi,
On the RF screen in the photo below, I want to add a field called "Waybill number" in the "Inbound Delivery Document" content. How can I do that?If you have any idea/suggestion please let me know. Thank you.

Hi Sercan,
with Screen Personas you have the option to modify the RF screens by e.g. hiding, rearranging or resizing screen elements. Please have a look at the guide.
Adding new fields is however not possible. If there is a requirement for a mobile application that goes beyond the scope of RF, the recommendation is to build mobile applications as side-by-side extensibility based on the available APIs in the API Business Hub.

Hello everyone, 
I am using PO 7.5 and developing a REST to RFC scenario. I am exposing BAPI_GOODSMVT_GETDETAIL, which takes 2 inputs. This means, URL will be of the form http://<server>:<port>/RESTAdapter/...?MaterialDocument=<value>&MaterialDocYear=<value>. 
In sender channel, I have made this:

My Message Type is 

So in UDF, I need to pass two inputs? Can someone guide me for that. I havent found any solution over the internet yet.
Without UDF and simple mapping, I get this error 
"Cannot create target element /ns1:BAPI_GOODSMVT_GETDETAIL/MATDOCUMENTYEAR. Values missing in queue context. Target XSD requires a value for this element, but the target-field mapping does not create one. Check whether the XML instance is valid for the source XSD, and whether the target-field mapping fulfils the requirement of the target XSD: Runtime Exception when executing application mapping program com/sap/xi/tf/_MM_REQ_BAPIGOODSMOVEMENTDETAIL"
Looking forward towards response.
Thanks 
Hi, 
I resolved the issue by creating 2 separate UDF's. Not sure if its an effecient solution. 
Thanks. 
Hi!
You might refer to this blog (or even others from the series) for better understanding:
https://blogs.sap.com/2014/12/18/pi-rest-adapter-exposing-a-function-module-as-restful-service/
Regards, Evgeniy.
Hi!
The most straight-forward way, I see (and which is described in mentioned blog), is to create UDF with two input parameters (one - for DC attribute name and the other - for attribute namespace). After that you'll be able to use the same UDF for mapping different DC attributes to target fields.
Regards, Evgeniy.
On another note, if I need to pass 3 parameters like 
http://<server>:<port>/RESTAdapter/...?MaterialDocument=<value>&MaterialDocYear=<value>&Var=<Value>, how will I get 3 variables in UDF? And in channel configuration. 
Hello Channel,
We have a requirement to migrate connectivity setup in between our CPI-DS and CPI-PI platform from basic user-based authentication to certificate based authentication. Have few questions regarding this. Please suggest.
Here is the background of the requirement -
Currently different 3rd party tools (ANAPLAN, Simple farm etc.) are connected with CPI-DS datastore via different WSDL (SOAP type datastore configuration) which are released from CPI-PI with basic user-based authentication method. In short, the 3rd party tools are connected with CPI-PI (with certificate-based communication setup) and CPI-PI is connected with CPI-DS via Basic user authentication-based setup. Here, the in-between connectivity setup of CPI-PI & CPI-DS needs to be migrated to certificate based authentication.
1. Is it possible to have certificate-based connection setup between CPI-DS & CPI-PI?
2. If yes, how to configure the same at CPI-DS side as well as CPI-PI end? (Any S-note or KBA describing the steps would be very helpful)
3. If yes, what are the steps that required to perform from Basis end regarding this? (Any S-note or KBA describing the steps would be very helpful)
Kindly suggest.
Hi,
How do you want to establish a data transfer between CPI-DS and CPI-PI? Via calling a web service in CPI-DS?
If the web service's soap address uses HTTPS protocol, you need the web service certificate and SSL configures as per KBA 1771712.

Dear AFC experts, 
In AFC , 'Planned end time of Task Approaching' scenario is not working. In order to make it work, I have already taken care of below setup:

To create a full stock/inventory list with date parameters in LX02, you will need to select the ‘Inventory Inquiry’ option in the Transaction Code dropdown. Then, enter the start and end dates for the query and click the ‘Inquire’ button. This will generate a full inventory list with the specified date parameters.

Inspired by Paul Todd's post about Using the new billing API's in BTP, I am wondering if it is possible to deploy a dashboard application and the associated SAP Usage Data Management Service in one Global Account and allow this dashboard to monitor consumption credits in other Global Accounts? The idea is to have a single centralised dashboard that can monitor, display and summarise the billing data and service usage across the selected Global Accounts.Based on the hint provided by Gregor Wolf in this question response, the Service Plans documentation states: 

This seems to suggest the dashboard application must be deployed directly in each Global Account that requires monitoring. I would appreciate a confirmation of whether my understanding is correct and any suggestions you may have to address the requirement.
Thanks,
Mustafa.

Hi Mustafa Bensan,
My understanding is that your dashboard deployed on SubAccount AA (which belongs to Global Account A) will need to gain access to the Usage Data Management Service for each other SubAccount (i.e.: BA, BB, CA, CB, CC, etc.). On each and every subaccount you would have an instance of the API created and thus each will have its api endpoint (same per landscape) and oauth2 credentials (one per instance on each subaccount - remember that the token url will change according to each subaccount).
In other words, you would need the the OAuth2 credentials stored on a secure location for each subaccount you would like to monitor. Then you will be able to consume the same API across multiple global accounts.
Hope this helps.

Hi Guys,I am facing an issue where I have to post multiple MIRO documents based on line items of PO. Say if reference PO have 3 line items, then doing MIRO with respect to it should generate 3 documents. How can this be achieved using customizing or custom development ?Thanks,Naveen
Done custom enhancement for the same to generate the desired result.
Enter the PO number and PO line item than post the MIRO document for individual PO line item......
Hi,
To achieve this you have to do MIRO for 3 times.
Each time for each line item. De-select the rest two line item when you are doing MIRO for first time.
You will see 2 line item for second time doing MIRO, And you can see the last one line item for last time miro.


Thanks
DEV
Hi Naveen,

Please let me know, the scenario exactly. Generally MIRO we will do according to vendor invoice. 

Whether vendor providing separate invoice for three line item. Could please elaborate your queries. 
So that we can provide exactly work around.

Regards,
Manikandan G
You can select particular item in MIRO and can post individually line items. Check button is help full to your requirement in MIRO. But if you wnat post at a time means it is not possible in standard you can post at a time only one document. or you can use customization.
See whether you can make PO line item mandatory using OB41 posting key 31 ( invoice ) field status. or through  SHDO

Hi Experts,
I need to find the log history of a particular distribution model (BD64). I have one suggestion: "The distribution model (BD64) entries would be updated in table TBD05." Check the logs for this table by providing the table name, date duration, and selecting the "Tables" radio button under the criteria "Evaluation for" in transaction SCU3 (evaluation of change logs). But it is not working. My requirement is that if there is any change in sender or receiver logical systems, I want to find those logical system names along with their filter values, if filters exist in BD64.
For example, ZDM is my distribution model, and SEN and REC are the logical systems for that distribution model. If I change the receiver system from REC with a filter value of 1000 to REC1 with a filter value of 999, Then I should get the date, time, REC, and REC VALUE 1000 as my output. 
Thanks in advance.
Best Regards,
Berinath Ulisi.
Hello,
prerequisites for the table logging are, beside the flag in SE13 for the table, a profile parameter rec/client (value has to be 'ALL' or has to contain the client) and, if you also want to cover changes caused by imported transport requests, a TMS parameter RECCLIENT (value = 'ALL' or has to contain the client) in the TMS configuration of the system. I guess at least one of these prerequisites is not given.

Hello all,
We are trying to copy from Actual version to Forecast version for the January, February and March for example (dynamic selection). In the copy rules we are not able to select the version dimension.
We are trying also to achieve this by using advanced formulas but we are getting the below error:
"The version dimension cannot be in left operand" when we are trying to write the data region back to our model to the new forecast version.
We have the option to create for each year a new forecast 1 version and to copy a region of data from actual version, but in this case we have to create a new forecast 1 version for each year (Forecast 1 2021 , Forecast 1 2022 etc), which is not a viable scenario.
Can anyone help us on how to achieve this?
Best regards

Vasileios Zarkadoulas
Both the standard Data Copy step and Advanced formula have a default parameter for version which means that when your run the copy step or the Advanced Formula you would be required to mandatorily select a value for version and the same will be used as target in copy step and in DATA() statement of Advanced Formula. You can just select the forecast version for which you want to run the step or formula.

If you see this parameter cannot be deleted .
When your run you have to select a value for it.

So a formula like below would copy Actuals to the version selected during the Data Action Run. You can add filters for other dimensions in both DATA() and RESULTLOOKUP().
Copy Step:
Configure something like below to copy from Actual to Forecast from 2022 to 2023. (prompt during data action run)

Data Action Run:

If you want Advanced Formula variation then please also explain you want to copy Actual to Forecast for what time region (From Year and Month ,  To Year and Month)
Hope this helps !!
Nikhil
Hello Nikhil,
Now it works! Really appreciate your help.
This is what confused me: In the context are of the copy function we have to select the Actual version only.
On the other side, during the Data Action Execution we have to select in the target version prompt, the forecast version. It was really simple but the UI is a little bit confusing especially if you have a BPC background, where you could define exactly the filters in the planning sequence.


Appreciate your help once again,

I am passing amount value into char15 field and displaying that char 15 amount field as decimal field in form layout because i need to display decimal point depending upon currency sometime 1000.00 or 160.980 or in korean currency amount like 11,111,546,890,841 like this but amount is not getting displayed in case of negative amount.



i tried with below pattern also but not getting displayed on letter.

I checked in debugged amount is getting passed in respective field but its not printing on form.

Kindly provide some input on this.
Kr,
Pandurang
I don't understand if you are talking about exchange rate, negative sign, or decimal point depending on currency.
Concerning CHAR 15, you do it all wrong. You have to handle currency amounts the SAP way i.e. declare the amount and currency key in the Form Interface based on the types from the DDIC structure (CURR and CUKY, amount field being connected to the currency key field).
e.g. if you pass parameter of type RBKP-BEZNK = 1.00 and RBKP-WAERS = 'JPY' (no decimals), it will display 100 because JPY has no decimals.

Negative amounts are also permitted at domain level:

Currency conversion based on exchange rate is something that you may need to calculate yourself, using the standard function modules.
Hello Experts,
I need to Delete non cumulative key figure values from a cube.
I have done selective deletion based on plant from that cube but after deletion when I am loading again with same plant ,
that non cumulative key figure value is not showing correctly.
It is summing the new value with old value(previous selective deletion was successful ).
Please help, how non cumulative key figure value can be deleted ??
Thanks,
Ipsita
Hi Ipsita, 
Are you familiar with the reference point of non cumulative cubes ? The reference point aggregates all the data at a given time. This reference point is stored in the cube with a particular date (99991231 ? can't check right now).
I guess you did a selective deletion on the "movements" and not on the reference point. This will give the behavior you described.
IMHO, the best way to delete records on non cumulative cubes is to load into the cube the opposite image of what you want to delete (+2 -2 = 0).
Regards,
Frederic
Hi Ipsita,
You can only selectively delete by a characteristic, not a key figure.
The only way I know would be an SQL command at the database level.

Dear Community Exerts,
I am working on an use case where customers can communicate over WhatsApp with a company's customer service department for inquires, obtaining order status, etc. Customer's interaction with company account in WhatsApp will be routed to a customer service agent's Live Activity work center in SAP Cloud for Service. The customer needs to be identified from the WhatsApp message. The agent can see the messages and respond from the Live Activity. The complete interaction will be saved in an activity. Also, a ticket can be created from the Live Activity during customer interaction.
Questions:
What are the options for a customer service rep to interact from the Live Activity work center in Cloud for Service?
What are the ways in which we can integrate WhatsApp inbound messages into the Live Activity in Cloud for Service, and enable outbound agent responses back to the customer on WhatsApp?
How routing can be handled to determine the agent best suited for providing service to the customer in this scenario?
Please share your insight/experience on the WhatsApp integration scenario. 
Thanks,
Prodipto
Dear Prodipto Roy do you have some response for your ask? good questions!
Hi,
You have a good use case but its not feasible only by configuring something from SAP Service Cloud side, it would also need some way to trigger the 'Live activity Session' from Whatsapp side - which I am not sure possible given its public & free version. 
Generally for anything to trigger a session in Live activity, the live activity needs to be called by the source system - in this case - whatsapp. So there needs to be a away for whatsapp to post the chat session to Service Cloud. This is not something Service Cloud is responsible for. 
What Service Cloud can do is consume the REST API ( if there any provided by WhatsApp for integration). 
If you see Administrator -> Service & Social ->Communication Channels -> Chat Provider : here we would map the URL and Key provided by Chat Provider.
In direct CTI integrations for Web Chat, the CTI provider sets up the call to live activity center using the parameterised method as described Here. once the chat session is invoked in their service.
Hope this helps.
I would be very interested to know if you get a way to push the session from WhatsApp (may be try the web version of Whatsapp and pay around the URL and scrpting ?? )
Thanks,Suchita
yes everything will be integrated on Gb whatsapp.

Dear Experts,
Recently I'm struggling with an issue of loading data from CV to InfoObject hierarchy. Few years ago I was implementing this data flow on SAP BW on HANA, however I'm not able to reproduce steps. Here is what I did as of now:
1. Created Calculation View returning data in a format required for hierarchies:
 
2. Created Data Source on top of CV - here I face first issue I don't see option to choose hierarchy as source type:
 
anyway I selected Master Data Attributes to be able to continue.
3. Then I created Transformation and DTP:
for Hierarchy Header I'm assigning field from CV with the name of hierarchy:
 
Other fields are mapped same way as for Data Source for flat file:
 
But then when I run the DTP I'm getting error message:More than one text specified for hierarchy header for language EN
When I load same data from a flatfile it works as fine (except HIENM field). I guess that I might missing something here. 
Does anyone did similair scenario and could share the experience?
Thanks in advance!

Finally I found SAP note 0002921201 ,which describes how mapping for specific tabs should look like. 
In general for tabs: Hierarchy Header, Hierarchy Description I should assign constants instead of using direct mapping.

Hey, all - please forgive my inexperience with this, but I don't know what else to do but ask at this point.
I have a web form that I'm trying to drop the CrystalReportViewer control onto in VS2022. However, on each add, it results in just a grey box with the following message:
Error Creating Control - CrystalReportViewer1
Method not found: 'Void CRVsPackageLib.ICRVSConfigWebFile.AddAssemblies(CRVsPackageLib.IServiceProvider, EnvDTE.ProjectItem)'.
I was previously able to successfully create a working report generator in a Windows Forms app.
Any idea what I might be missing? I'm at a loss, and any advice will be greatly appreciated.
You should not have "place" the Viewer manually, if it's not there then you don't have rights to install software or your AV software is blocking the installer.
What version of Windows are you using?
IIS and Visual Studio must be installed before installing CR for VS
Then right click on the Installer and select Run as Administrator:
CR for Visual Studio SP32 64b installer (VS 2022 and above)
Click OK to get the 32 bit runtime installed so you can select X86 or X64 in project Properties.
In the Toolbox select Choose Item and select the CR Viewer.
mmm... interesting, I'm getting the same error now when dropping the Viewer onto the form.
Ignore it and then run the App... It works...
I'll have to ask R&D what's up... I did add that Lib file to the project, made no difference...
Don
Did you download and install the 64-bit version of SP32 of the Crystal for Visual Studio SDK?  If not, you need to do that.  You can find it through the wiki.  You need to make sure you download the "install package", which is a .exe file.  All of the other downloads are for various versions of the runtimes that you use only when deploying your application.  
Once you've downloaded the installer, make sure that
1.  Visual Studio is not running.
2.  You need to right-click on the installation .exe and select "Run as administrator" in order for the integration with Visual Studio to install correctly.

See my Blog on upgrading your project:

VS can be a pain sometimes, it doesn't always redirect to the correct references..
Be sure to set Copy Local to False for all CR assemblies, if you have any in your \bin folder it will cause problems.
Copy the CRViewer folder into your project, that may fix it. 
Are you testing with IISExpress or IIS?
Can you view the report in VS?
In VS and your form does it show the embedded viewer on your page?
Not the right one, it's WEB so you need the WEB Viewer here:
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\system_web\4_0_30319
Copy the whole CR folder into your project
Hi Adam,
That's the problem then, that folder gets installed when you install the EXE.
Try reinstalling it and be sure to right click on the EXE and select "Run as Administrator"
If it's still not there then likely cause is you AV or Firewall software is blocking it.
Until you get it installed your app isn't going to work.
And copy just the Viewer folder into your project.
Don
Use ProcessMonitor and look to see where IIS is attempting to load the viewer from.
Usually adding the viewer to the project resolves the issue.
Hi Adam,
I encountered same issue with you. Did you by any chance solve the problem?

Hello,
I want to activate in TA STC01 - Tasklist SAP_FIORI_FCM_CONTENT_ACTIVATION a ZRole and get at the end the error:
"Service: /sap/bc/webdynpro/sap/any failed. Reason: Service not availableFor detailed analysis activate failed service manually with transaction SICF"
When I have a look in SICF, this service could not be found? Has someone an idea to solve this issue?
Thx in advance

Hi Werner, 
That typically means the Webdispatcher isn't fully configured for the webdynpro paths. 
See KBA 2740052 - Which paths are necessary to configure Web Dispatcher for Fiori Launchpad scenarios?
Add this path to the WDP profile and the error should clear
/sap/bc/webdynpro

open path in SICF --> right click on SAP --> add NEW SUBELEMENT --> select as Standalone Service --> save and activate service. This solved my issue

Not a question, more of a knowledge base item.
For those who use program RSAR_PSA_CLEANUP_DIRECTORY to proactively repair PSAs during BW House Keeping and monitor the BW systems using SLG1 Application log:
When using program RSAR_PSA_CLEANUP_DIRECTORY in Repair Mode and a discrepancy is found, a red error is generated in SLG1 with the message "Request already deleted in PSA directory" This is a bit surprising, because the very intent of the repair mode to find and repair discrepancies in PSA and DSO change logs between the application and the database. 
The reason appears to be because the Check Mode correctly identifies these discrepancies as red errors and the status determination is used for both Check and Repair Modes. 
Dear Community,

Do you have experience with MDG integration from data providers (e.g. Dun & Bradstreet)? Does SAP have a standard workflow type (MDG-C and MDG-S) for changes triggered from monitoring data providers to update master data? If there is a standard, does it also exist for contact persons (UBO/ Beneficial Owner)?

Kind regards
Isabelle
Hi  Isabelle Köhler,
Every Change Request Type can be "enhanced" to retrieve info from external data providers.
However, I'd recommend to use a custom defined CR type. In this way, you will safeguard the related configuration for future upgrade.
BR,
R.
Hi Isabelle,
this is a very common request: Whenever a new BP (Customer or Supplier) is created, one would like to get most of the relevant master data from external data provider: This reduces work and makes sure the master data is of good quality!
In addition (as you've mentioned) there is the need to regularly update the master data triggered by changes happening in the data provider side.
Good answer: Our Partner CDQ (cdq.com) provides a very rich and complete interface to various data providers (>70) and is able to integrate their API directly into SAP MDG. Instead of building and integration one interface for each data provider, there is only one and CDQ is orchestrating the rest.
The business partner data they provide also contain contact person information.
This solution is avaiable on the SAP Store as Endorsed App:
https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-0000031305_live_v1/cdq-first-time-right

Hi Olaf,
Thank you for the answer. 
We currently use one change request type for new customer creation, one for suppliers. We have the same for changes. When working with a data provider, the question is whether the standard can be reused or something completely new is needed. The best way for us would be to reuse the same change request types.
Kind regards
Isabelle
The content export process is quite transparent and does not cause any major problems.
 
However, I am wondering about another issue, namely the export of users and their subsequent import to SEN.
What is the issue of importing users? If I wanted to recruit 400 users, for example.
Is some "special" Excel program needed? What fields are mandatory?
 
Will importing new users overwrite them in the Manager resource?
 
Will this be the case where the import will mean uploading a list of users that replaces the previous list of users?
 
Best wishes
Raphael
Exporting from where? Assuming you mean from Enable Now, then use exactly the same Excel worksheet you go from the Export, populate that with your new users, then use menu option Administration > User Import.

Please check and let us know.

Hi Vikram Soundankar Soundankar
The automatic selection of Batches and Serial Numbers can be controlled at Warehouses - Setup > Bin Locations. You will have the fields "Auto Alloc. on Issue" and "Auto Alloc. on Receipt". The method "Single Choice" should require the user to select the entries manually.
Kind RegardsNidhi SinghSAP Business One Support
I think you need to use Ui template and hide the button for auto selection and find the field in the table which store the behavior how user selected batch and use transaction notification based on that field. 
Hi Abdul,
Can you please specify the Form name of UI Template to disable this.
I tried with multiple Batch forms but not able to find the Auto select option.

Hi,
Guess, you will have to disable the option from individual login.
Hi,
It's better to use SDK either to disable or invisible the button.
oForm.Items.Item("16").Visible = false;

Hi,
First, you can hide/disable "Auto select" button from Tool >>> Edit Form UI.

Second, go to User window and use Copy Form Settings to copy it to any user.

Hi all,
I am having an issue with settling of labour costs from my Refurbishment order, IW81. Any components that are booked against the order are correctly settled to the material and the MAP is adjusted. However internal labour is not affecting MAP and is instead being settled to a Production Variance offsetting account. This has the affect of reducing my stock value. 
 Can someone please advise what config tcode or path I need to look at to get all actual costs for the refurbishment order to correctly settle to the material and adjust the MAP. 
Thanks all,
Shawn

Hello Shawn Crane,
Your internal labour is being settled to a Production Variance offsetting account. It seems there is ledger/cost centre config is mismatched that's why internal labour posted to different account instead of MAP. Please connect with your FI Consultant to fix this issue.

Hi,
Can anybody provide me some information on what these two options under the Scripting section of Analytic Application in SAC are meant for?. Since we can also use the export option of a widget to export the data to pdf, excel, csv, would like to know why we have these in the scripting section on the left?
Regards,
Madhu
There are a couple of things you can do with them,
I often use the export to PDF api to export an entire screen of an analytic app as a PDF file, you can choose whichwidgets are included in the pdf, so it could be the case I want to export the dashboard title, text widgets and all the tables, charts .... but leave out dropdowns and buttons etc to produce a cleaner PDF without unnecessary clutter.
I found that the two above options can be executed using script such as a Button (onclick).
Thank you.

Hi Experts
The requirement is Customer Service team creates Customer Return delivery in office this should go to 3PL partner which messages type and IDOC should i use.
I already tried with DESADV, in Outbound its working for fine but for returns its not identifying processing Program, we are using the Standard Processing Program RSNASTED & Form Routine
Processing program missing for output ZPL0 (medium 6)
Message no. VN020
Diagnosis
No processing program is defined in table TNAPR for output type ZPL0 (transmission medium 6) in application .
System Response
This output cannot be entered.
Procedure
In Customizing, enter a processing program for output type ZPL0 and transmission medium 6. 
Thanks
Mohit
The error message under "Diagnosis" is self explanatory.  Did you check the TNAPR table ?  Any entry is there for the output ZPL0 ?
By the way, for return delivery, you can try With message type SHPCON where, in segment E1EDL18, use qualifier "PGI" instead of "PGR"
Hello Mohit Bhinde
I'd suggest you use Delivery Interface i.e. WHSORD and WHSCON ALE/IDoc messages to integrate with 3PL warehouse operator.

When the Vendor is blocked system is not allowing to change the Partner roles like GS / PI in the Purchase Order.
It throws an error the VN Partner role vendor is blocked, error is ME022.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
What you are seeing is correct (and expected) - when the Vendor Block is applied, this means it is blocked from any new orders, or changes to existing orders.
When adding / changing the partner number (linked in the document) the system checks if the change is a valid one (meaning the Vendor is still okay to use) - if block is applied at this point, it constitutes a new change.
You can apply one of these workarounds:
> Temporarily unblock the vendor, change the PO and block the vendor again (recommended)
or:
> Use ME22 transaction (old unsupported but still accessible transaction ME22 is still available and not includes this vendor block check comparing to ME22n)
Hope this clarifies, and thanks for the question!
Hi All, 
I have a requirement to create a new PR from existing PRs, in this process if there are any attachments for choosen existing PR those should be copied as well.
I am using UploadSet for regular attachment functionalities like upload, download and delete functionalities are all working fine.
But for the above stated functionality "Copy Attachments" from existing PR, I implemented like below. By this time there are existing attachments on my UI("idAttach") .
            _uploadExistingFiles: function (oItems) {                var that = this,                    attachmentsUploader = this.getView().byId("idAttach"),                    tmpPRNumber = this.getView().getModel("utilModel").getProperty('/tmpPRNumber');                (attachmentsUploader.getItems()).forEach(function (item) {                    attachmentsUploader.removeAllHeaderFields();                    var slugVal = item.getFileName() + "," + tmpPRNumber;                    attachmentsUploader.addHeaderField(new sap.ui.core.Item({                        key: "slug",                        text: slugVal                    }));                    attachmentsUploader.addHeaderField(new sap.ui.core.Item({                        key: "x-csrf-token",                        text: that.mainService.getSecurityToken()                    }));                    item.setUploadState("Ready");                    attachmentsUploader.uploadItem(item);                })            },
attachmentsUploader.uploadItem(item) is calling the respective standard methods and OData service asexpected but its not passing file Object of the item uploaded .i.e. item.getFileObject() is null. 
So obviously at OData there is no IS_MEDIA_RESOURCE, and file can't uploaded due to missing blob of object.

But in case when we upload files from UI using UploadSet control it is calling "FileUploader.prototype.handlechange"
there it is constructing file object and passing to "beforeUploadStarts" .
Any inputs much appreciated
Thanks
Rajesh
Fixed, UploadSetItem supports "_setFileObject" where need to construct the file object
please find below code.
item._setFileObject(that._constructFileObject(item)); 
Hello.
I work in a brewery, where we use SAP Business One with the Produmex Ad-On. I am running into an issue with the Stock Transfer function within just SAP- so not regarding the Produmex function (or at least I do not think so).
I currently use the Stock Transfer to move material from the warehouse to the brewery, so they can then express brews through the OBeer ad-on, which I do not use. Stock Transfer works totally fine, so long as there 1. are not multiple/any SSCC's and 2. is more than the quantity being moved in the bin. I have found a way to break the first condition on the receiving end, since starting in this role; however, the second contingency is what I am caught on. Because I want to be able to empty a location and just move that, without having to swap to a Stock Transfer Request and then run through Produmex as a picklist.
With that background, my question is: How do I allow a location to be depleted/take the locations stock to zero? Is it related to the Organizational Structure settings of each location? Does it fall larger than that on the Organizational Structure of the warehouse? Or does it fall on something completely different?
I do want to also make everyone aware that I do not have full-administrative access, so I cannot look into the coding or programing of my company's SAP base. All the information I gave and knowledge I have, stem from hours of reading and playing with the program to learn where everything is and the intricacies. I may have one of the larger understandings of the program within who uses it here, however, I would be silly to not say I am Novice to Advanced Beginner. But that is why I am here. Appreciate any help!
Hi,
your options depend on your License and Authorizations setup in the system. I would suggest checking if you can access "Bin Location Content List" report. There you can set filters (warehouse, bin location codes, item codes etc.) which you want to have in the report. When the report shows everything you have in that location, select all the lines and click on "Stock Transfer" at the bottom right corner. Then choose "Clear Inventory" and the entire stock should be copied to Stock Transfer, all you need now is to confirm the batches and/or bin locations.
Also, if you want to know more you can always take a look at the Learning Journey:

Hi Experts,
I am unable to filter out the field data upon doing a 'Show' for a model table or join function as shown below (where I wanted to filter on Effective Date field here) :

But this possibility was present earlier. Is this some update from SAP? and if so, when will this feature be available again. Can you please let us know as this was an important feature. (Also, I am aware of the fact that we could filter from the filter section present in the right, but I would prefer this specific convenient way of filtering).

Hi Experts,
We are working on SAP APIM to pass some 11 query parameters values from source to target URL.

We have source URL something like below (strings in bold are source query parameter names).
As you can see there are around 10 query parameters coming from Source system.
https://<host>/org/v1/api/compdata/vendor_profile?companyno=06598&companyname=&siteno=&sitename=&address=&city=&state=&postal=&country=&pagesize=
I am using place holder then java script to pass values from query parameters passed from source to target URL.
Target URL looks something like below.
http://<host>:<port>/OrgDev/rest/v1/datasources/VENDOR_PROFILE/execute?COUNTRY$PARAM='{country}'&COMPANY_NAME$PARAM='{companyname}'&COMPANY_NUMBER$PARAM='{companyno}'&SSP_NUMBER$PARAM='{siteno}'&SSP_NAME$PARAM='{sitename}'&SSP_ADDRESS$PARAM='{address}'&SSP_CITY_COUNTY$PARAM='{city}'&SSP_STATE$PARAM='{state}'&SSP_POSTAL_CODE$PARAM='{postal}'&pagesize='{pagesize}'
I have used java script policy to fetch values from source and pass them to target URL.
My configuration works completely fine when there are only 5 or 6 query parameters but does not work there are more query parameters from source like in this case where there are 10 query parameters.
Even API is not getting deployed when I give above target URL in bold as per below screenshot.
Looks like there is limitation of 256 characters when I try to deploy the API itself.
I get below error when I try to deploy the API like unable to update API and when I remove some query parameters to adjust the characters count to 256 or less then API is getting deployed successfully.

Could you please suggest another work around to overcome this issue.
Can we somehow use some policies to get this issue resolved and to generate target URL as required.
Kindly guide me to resolve this issue , Thank you!
Regards.
Hi,
You can use Assign Message policy to add query params to create your target URL. In the Target URL, just keep http://<host>:<port>/OrgDev/rest/v1/datasources/VENDOR_PROFILE/execute.
Something similar to below code:

Hi ,

How to chanage the valuation class of material if some stock exist for that material , i need step by step procedure . I had seen many posts which are existing on SDN , but not in clear maner .

RB
Hi,

If the stock exists for the material we cant change the valuation class. 

Pls try to change the material type in MMAM transaction and then try to change valuation class.

But Im not sure it will work.

Can you tell me the Business scenario, so can through some light ?

reg

Durga

*Assign points if the info is useful
hi,

you will not able to change the valuation class if any open document exists.

if you make change in the valution class from the material master,then if any open document exists then you will able to get those document by clicking on display errors.


jash
Hi raghavendra,

Right you might have seen the posts in SDN.

Generally you have to

delete transactional data 
set your stock to 0 both in previous and in current period. (use MB1A201 with posting date in the previous period to eliminate your stock; via MB1A202 you can reset your stock level after the material master change) 

If you've had material movements in this period for your material it may be very difficult to set the stock to 0 because you should cancel all goods movements. In this case you'd better wait till the end of the month: set the stok to 0 on the last day of May > change on first day of June > reset stock level on the first day of June.

So my suggestion is you first transfer the stock to another plant and delete if any open prs/pos exist and change the Valuation class then.

You cannot escape the above steps.

Reg,
Ashok

Reward if useful.

hi

Goto tcode MM02 - Accounting View 1 - This tcode is to change the valuation class directly. 

Whether you can or cannot change the valuation class directly without changing the material type depends on your own company img settings. 

If you want to change the valuation class, there may be because of one or more of the following already exist for the material: 

1) Valuated stocks in the current period or in the previous period. 
2) Open purchase orders may be there. 
3) Production orders which a goods movement has already taken place. 

For this first you have to do the following: 

If valuated stocks already exist, you can change the valuation class only: 

a) Post the stocks of the material to an interim account. 
b) Change the valuation class in the material master record. 
c) Post the stocks of the material back to their original account. 

If open purchase orders already exist, you can only change the valuation class if you first flag the corresponding purchase order items for deletion. 

If production orders exist for which a goods movement has already taken place, you can only change the valuation class if you first set the status of the production orders to deleted 

By this you can keep the same material type as FG and can assign the proper valuation class.

                name: "propertyValue[0]",
                value: "cmis:document"
            }));

            oUploadCollection.addParameter(new UploadCollectionParameter({
                name: "propertyId[1]",
                value: "cmis:name"
            }));

            oUploadCollection.addParameter(new UploadCollectionParameter({
                name: "propertyValue[1]",
                value: oEvent.getParameter("files")[0].name
            }));
        },


Now that UploadCollection is deprecated, I want to implement upload using UploadSet.
However, in UploadSet I cannot find a method equivalent to addParameter() in UploadCollection.
How can I add parameters to UploadSet? Or, should I fall back to UploadCollection for this case?
Best regards,
Mio

Mio YasutakeYou can add parameters to an UploadSet using the setParameters() method.
We currently have a SAP CAP project with a HANA DB deployed in production where we have several services scheduled via the BTP Job Scheduler. Via the job scheduler the services are called and they read OData services from the S/4 backend system and update data in a SAP HANA DB on BTP. Several Fiori apps available for end users read those SAP HANA BTP tables .
We are now trying to do a PoC to use a PostgreSQL db instead of a SAP HANA DB but we face several issues. This is one of those issues.
The deployment and the creation of the PostgreSQL db in SAP BTP goes fine. Also if we open the Fiori apps via the launchpad the data can be retrieved from the PostgreSQL db. All looks good so far.
However, when running the project from Business Application Studio, when it reads something from the PostgreSQL db, we get an error like:
{"error":{"code":"ECONNRESET","message":{"lang":"en","value":"read ECONNRESET"},"severity":"error","target":"/#TRANSIENT#","innererror":{"errordetails":[{"code":"ECONNRESET","message":{"lang":"en","value":"read ECONNRESET"},"severity":"error","target":"/#TRANSIENT#"}]}}}

What I did so far was:
1. default-env.json has the environment variables from the service from BTP.
2. Run Configuration configuration is created and binded, but no db is there anymore (as it was with hana). So it can only be bounded to the destinations of the S4 system. I tried "run configuration" as well as cds serve, but both give the same error as described above.
3. In .cdsrc.json I added a test user with the correct role which should give access to all tables (with HANA db this also worked):
{ "[development]": { "auth": { "passport": { "users": { "maarten@weijer.com": { "password": "password", "ID": "maarten@weijer.com", "roles": [ "PALCentralManager" ] } } } } }
4. In package.json I added the credentials to the PostgreSQL db (didn't deploy this change to BTP though, just changed it in BAS):

What am I doing wrong?
Kind regards,
Maarten Weijer

Not sure if this is ready to be applied in a Production environment. 
If it is a real connection reset, i.e. it works for a while then errors out, try setting idle_timeout to something less than 2 hours (source: https://github.com/porsager/postgres/issues/179)
I installed Visual Studio Code but now I am getting an ETIMEDOUT instead of an ECONNRESET.

Hi Experts,
I am trying to create a table through ABAP on cloud. When giving the fields of the table I am trying to use a standard data element "BUKRS" for one of the fields. However, I get an error "Use of data element BUKRS" is not permitted.
Using any other standard data element also gives the same error.
Please suggest how I can use standard data elements in my custom table.
Thanks and Regards
In SAP Cloud Platform ABAP Environment you are only allowed to use APIs and DDIC Elements that have been released by SAP. 
You can check which objects that are available easily in ADT. The following screen shows shows the objects that have been released objects for 1908.

There are in addition restrictions for the type of objects that can be created. It's for example not possible to create reports (programs) since there is no SAPGUI access possible anymore. 
https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/b31aa03640b940d5981ce2af1cd0a019.html


It mostly has to do with your ADT verison.
I have version 3.1.202 and getting same error with below declaration while a colleague has 3.5.0 version of ADT and it's working fine for them.
My recommendation is to update ADT version and see. Also, another workaround ( not suggested for productive purpose) is to create a custom data element similar to bukrs and use same in table declaration.
Hi Sakshi,
I checked my code in  ADT version 3.5.0 as well and got the same error. So, it's not ADT version but some system setting which unfortuntely I am not aware, so let's wait for other gurus.

Dear Experts,
My Scenario is PROXY to REST synchronous. this interface has been working fine in production since a month onwards. i got the Premature end of file error. Even in logs level RESTAPI url is not visible along with token & content-type. Also i have tested the input payload in the Request message mapping level, it was executed successfully. what might be the reason? could any one help on this?
error : Returning to application. Exception: com.sap.engine.interfaces.messaging.api.exception.MessagingException: Error encountered while executing mapping: com.sap.aii.af.service.mapping.MappingException: Mapping failed in runtimeRuntime Exception when executing application mapping program com/sap/xi/tf/_MM_GSTR2AReconciliationExport_RES_; Details: com.sap.aii.utilxi.misc.api.BaseRuntimeException; Premature end of file.
thanks in advance.
Best Regards,
nagaraju
"Premature end of file error" generally happens if your provided payload is different from expected payload, or it can just be wrong payload altogether with syntactical error and what not.
Going by your description, your issue is that it is failing at runtime. Would you be able share screenshot of payload from runtime and the one you are testing in message mapping?
Dear Saurabh,
thanks for your response. i have tested request payload in request message mapping this was executed successfully.

i have noticed here, response payload level i am not getting anything. Is might be the reason for response message mapping (MM_GSTR2AReconciliationExport_RES) failure?
here auth-token & content-type i am sending as a HTTP headers.
Best Regards,
nagaraju.
Dear Saurabh,
you are absolutely correct. i have added {http_result} in the Error handling tab REST receiver channel level. Because i am getting 422 ( unprocessable entity error) always, this error is Data validation error. if i don't keep {http_result} in the channel level, those message will failed in the PI level and won't replicate exact error in the sender system.
without removing {http_result} do we have any alternative solution?
Best Regards,
nagaraju
Dear Saurabh,
thanks for your response.
if the request message got successful then i will get the successful respone on result (as shown in the below screenshot ) stucture level data. if the request message will fail then i will get the errors or root structure structures ( as shown in the below screenshot ). please check the below Channel level screenshots also.

Hi
I hope someone can help with this query, I have a query that will show the top 10 invoiced customers, I have a date range so the accountant can use the query for any year.
SELECT TOP 10 T0.CardCode, MAX(T0.Cardname) as Customer, SUM(T0.doctotal) as 'Amount(LC)'
FROM dbo.OINV T0
WHERE t0.docdate BETWEEN [%0] AND [%1]
GROUP BY T0.CardCode
Order by SUM(T0.doctotal) DESC
This works well but how do I enhance this query so it gives the top 10 customers from their invoices within a date range - any credit notes within the same date range?
Any help would be appreciated.

Hello,
I have downloaded eCATT test configurations from a customer test system and uploaded them into their new solution manager (development) system.
When opening one of the test configurations via the 'Test Repository - Test Configurations'-App, a prompt will ask for import into a solution existing on the solution manager system. I then choose the desired solution and confirm.The system data is still not correct though and I see no possibility to change/correct it. Through the app I cannot change the system assignment as it will only show the error message 'there is no system in the logical component'. Through the SECATT transaction, I also have no possibility to change the system (data container) assignment.
Can anyone suggest a way of fixing the assignment of an uploaded ECATT test configuration to the correct system data container?
Thank you in advance for any ideas.
Dear community,I am defining VDM for one of the APIs which we need to develop.I want to use abstract CDS view to cover importing parameters of existing ABAP coding in an unmanaged RAP scenario.
Let's say I have a root abstract entity to cover top level of importing parameters:Structure xField 1 type intField 2 type structure yField 3 type structure z
Structure z
Field 4 type char
Field 5 type structure y
Structure y
Field 6 type int
How can I define nested abstract views for this? 1) If I define abstract view y as composition under abstract view x and abstract view z, I am getting error that only one parent can exist.2) If I am supposed to define it via associations with keys, then I would need to include "dummy" key fields in each abstract view to be able to make hierarchy relationships based on dummy keys.3) If I create two separate abstract CDS views XY and ZY in order to be able to define parent relationship to one parent, even though they are same from field list perspective, it will work I assume. But somehow I think I am missing something as it seems weird to me that we cannot reuse defined abstract entities in other abstract views irrelevant on which level they are used.
Can you please advise what is best practice in defining abstract CDS view to replicate deep DDIC structure while on different levels of that deep structure certain fields reuse same type (DDIC structure, structure y in above example)?
Thank you!

I have found out description on following wiki.In my example, it should be something like below:

@VDM.usage.type: [#ACTION_PARAMETER_STRUCTURE]
@ObjectModel.supportedCapabilities: [#DATA_STRUCTURE]
define root abstract entity [structure x]
{
Field 1 : int;_Field 2 : association [0..*] to [structure y] on 1 = 0; //reuse
Field 3 : composition [0..*] of structure z
}
@VDM.usage.type: [#ACTION_PARAMETER_STRUCTURE]
@ObjectModel.supportedCapabilities: [#DATA_STRUCTURE]
define root abstract entity [structure z]
{
Field 4 : char;
_Field 5 : association [0..*] to [structure y] on 1 = 0; //reuse
}

Hi all,
i am trying to read the detailed space definitions from SAP DWC using the @sap/dwc-cli as Node.js module dependency.
Therefore i use the CLI parameter "--definitions" or "-D" with value "" (empty string) in order to get all definitions. But unfortunately this gets ignored.If i use this "--no-space-definition": "" it works like expected.What do i have to pass for "-D" to get all definitions?Coding looks like this, but there is nothing incorrect. It is only about the passing of the "--definitions" param.
const options = {"--host": "MYHOST"}

await commands["spaces read"]({...options,...{"--definitions", ""}})
Ok solved it by blind testing.You have to set it like "--definitions": true
Hi Lukas Käser
when reading your question again I was asking myself if this is a typo? 
await commands["spaces read"]({...options,...{"--definitions", ""}})
Can you try await commands["spaces read"]({...options,...{"--definitions": ""}})
"--definitions", "" vs "--definitions": ""
Thank you!
Hello Planning Gurus,I need to calculate the Qty sub-total for suppliers accross products and based on it calculate a discount. Discount should be written to spearate key figure to # node -> for the aggregated dimension.

I know I can aggregate the Qty to # write it to the acutal version then calculate discount and delete the # qty.
But I was wondering if there was an elegant way using VARIABLEMEMBER or VARIABLE.I still struggle to comprehend the mechanics of those fully and my experiments with them did not work as intended.
Thanks for all replies in advance!

Try something like below. Change the name of dimensions and measures as per your model. Run this Data Action on Version Actual. It might work even without the FOREACH.BOOKED [d/SUPPLIER].... ENDFOR (Try commenting the FOREACH and ENDFOR line to check)

Dear Community,
we have a SAC dashboard based on a BW live connection data model. We are receiving the error CL_BICS_INA_COMMONS APPLY_FILTERS INCORRECT TUPLE FORMAT when interacting with the dashboard by doing the following steps:
1. We have a page filter (consists of multiple dynamic date ranges) for the posting months and are for example interested in seeing the total count of documents in Jun, May and April. So we apply the filters on those months

2. In a chart of the same page, we now want to drill down on an entity, in this example 2780

3. We apply an in-chart filter on that entity

4. and are receiving this error CL_BICS_INA_COMMONS APPLY_FILTERS INCORRECT TUPLE FORMAT, TOO FEW COMPONENTS

Has anyone faces a similar issue and how were you able to solve it? It is worth to mention that the dashboard works fine as long as we only filter on one period only. The error comes up when filtering on 2 or more periods. 
Business want to see the trends so we have to give them the option to filter on more than 1 period.
SAC is running on version 2022.8.19.
We would really appreciate your help!
Thank you,

Hello Experts,
We were discussing an issue where Project is Private so no one can see that project except assigned Responsible as Project Manager, Project Controller, Project Accountant etc
Now in case Project manager has some issues while maintaining Project then how a support staff member can access that project and resolve the issue.
we do not have any Restriction based on Public and Private as this is on top of all the roles and authorizations.
How can we give access to Support Staff for a private project.
thanks
SYADAV
Hello SYADAV,

for a private project you could give access to Support Staff by creating new project roles on project header (e.g. Support Staff 1, Support Staff 2, ...) and assigning the Support Team Members (Business Partner - Employee). 

This feature was introduced with release 2002. Show & Tell Recording: https://s4hanacloud.community.sap/groups/HzKQzw50FoTkrVY08r6iC1/documents/dNZiT4QVcPusw1UQm9pK2F/video_viewer?_lightbox=true

Best regards,
Nikolai
Sorry Nikolai Emling for removing Best Answer mark 

I found one restriction which is about Public and Private thing

Restriction Type: PS_RES_REQUEST
Field Name: RSHREQVIS (Public Project): Use this field to grant users access to search for and select resource requests. Select N to allow access to projects that are not visible to everyone and value Y to allow access to projects that are public. You can also grant unrestricted access to all projects (* authorization).

I think this will resolve this requirement. what you think?

But only issue is, this is only visible in Read only tab for maintain restrictions for any role. and may work for display only but not Edit mode.

Hello SYADAV,

After review of this thread, Nikolai's answer has been marked as best again. 

To clarify, when the project is set to private, only the project stakeholders can access this project and this is the intended behavior. 

If you require top management to access private projects then the suggestion is to assign them to one of the standard project roles. If the standard roles are not enough, you may create custom roles that can be configured as of 2002 and assign the users.

In case you are trying to maintain the restriction of access to projects via the business roles assigned to end users, then please review the available restriction types most recently available in 2005. 

https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/0002902340

If the restriction type is not available then please create a customer influence request. 

https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#

Kind regards,
Feras

Hi Nikolai Emling & Feras Al-Basha 
as per your comment, its absolutely fine but what if customer require the functionality where a set of people for example 20 from top management need to access projects and see project financials and other things. i think roles creation is feasible for 1 or 2 peoples. this is not feasible solution.

moreover this is basic requirement where few peoples need at least display access of all projects.

thanks for all the help and guidence.

have a good day
thanks
SYADAV
Nikolai Emling sorry to say but in that case either we need to add one more role all the time or once we need help then we can add. but this is not the correct solution.

Let me describe the issue in another words, lets say all the projects are Private and can only be accessible to project owners (all 4 roles as SAP standard has given) now my customer want a User ID or Role by which that person can access all the projects (that person might be from top management like MD/CEO/CFO etc)

Do we have anything to overwrite the Private tag and can be visible by a specified person only? Got requirement from one of my customer actually that no other DM can see project but might be available to top management atleast to overlook.

i think this is not only a specific requirement to any customer but this should be there so this could be possible to access all projects for any person as required. right now we do not have any overwrite project setting as "Private"

thanks
SYADAV
Hello All,
in case we mark any project as Private then SAP has not given any way to access these project except project stakeholders.

this should be available either by restriction or some other way.

please correct me if i am wrong here.

thanks
SYADAV
Hello All,
IF we have a private project then its impossible to see that project other than person assigned to project roles.
we need to overcome this as client want to allow a set of peoples who should be allowed to see any project at any time.
this can be controlled if we have any restriction type for Private projects.

please suggest if any other best way to check this functionality.

thanks
SYADAV
Hi Feras Al-Basha, what if if the project manager - intentionally or inadvertently - sets a project as private and removes all additional roles? Will anybody else be able to access the project in addition to him? 

Thank you,
-Luca-
Hi Sunil Yadav, yes, I am aware of this relevant weakness in the design of the authorization logic. I pointed it out to SAP in the past upon request of our auditors. It is quite obvious that such a situation is unacceptable: an administrator must be able to access every piece of data in the system, if needed.

Just wanted to ask Feras Al-Basha if in the meantime a solution has been planned.

Thank you,
-Luca-
BTW: we temporarily "solved" the issue by hiding the Private switch in the UI.
Dear Experts,
I am trying to write an advanced formula to copy year actuals data (year 2019) from Actual version to future years (say 2020, 2021) in a Plan Version.
Got an error stating that "The Version dimension or property cannot be used with FOREACH, DELETE and DATA instructions".
Is this an existing limitation in SAC.
If yes then what could be the best way to achieve this requirement.
Currently I can think of using version management to copy from Actual to Plan for the same year (2019) and then use Advanced Formula to copy from Plan version 2019 to 2020, 2021 and so on.
Appreciate your inputs on this.
Hi Vineet,
Here is the example for copying data from actual to plan version using advanced formula.

Hi,
I have the same issue. My customer wants to be able to copy a region of data from a source version to a target version.
How can this be done ?
Thanks a lot for your help
Camille
Hi, similarly, I wanted to copy 1H 2020 actual to a forecast version. I used the copy step in a data action trigger, setting the version to actual and dates to 1H 2020. Then when I ran the data action trigger, I selected the target version (i.e. forecast). I had do it month by month to reduce the aggregations. The full six months took too long and data copy was corrupted. Alternatively, I think you could add multiple copy steps for different periods in one data trigger, but I didn't test that out.
You need to add a filter for the source version. If you do not filter on the version, then the copy action will only copy within the specified target version.
https://help.sap.com/viewer/00f68c2e08b941f081002fd3691d86a7/LATEST/en-US/b5720be6f2ed41178762973df9e4af16.html
In the SAC data action, Target version is a default prompt so only thing you need to do is set the filter with source version then it will prompt target version as well as source version. 
In other words, you need to filter only for source version in the copy step of your data action because target version will be prompted as default.
Hello all,
We are facing the same issue. Has anyone find a solution to this?

Hi Experts,
We are replicating an ABAP report using a calculation view where we do certain calculations (decimal precision is very crucial). Along this process it seems the the decimal precision is lost. Say we have to compute the following:
14000/1.12*0.99625
NOTE: The last 2 operand are default. Only the first operand (14000) value may change via input parameter.
The result for this calculation is 12453.12500000000 whereas the expected value is 12453.124999999998.
This is the actual process and the value we derived between ABAP and HANA
1.) Calculate value as <input parameter>/1.12*0.99625
Example: 14000/1.12*0.99625
ABAP = 12453.124999999998 
SAP = 12453.12500000000 
2.) Get 100th decimal place 
ABAP = 12453.124 
SAP = 12453.125 
3.) Round up to 2 decimal place 
ABAP = 12453.12 
SAP = 12453.13
As you notice, due to the precision we will be getting variance.
I already tried a number of combination of data type and conversion function but to no avail.
Can someone please enlighten me on this behavior and perhaps suggest fixes/workaround?
Regards,
Rod Castro
Hi Rod,
This seems to do the trick:


Regards,
Frederic
also you can try like below, keep same decimals as Frederick mentioned 
(14000/1.12*0.99625)*1.000000000000
keep same number of ZERO's, check the data in Raw data.
Hi Experts,
I have a scenario where, when an original invoice document is cancelled, output is triggered (only if output not triggered the first time- Initially the output condition routine (VV32 parameters please refere below screenshots))

and later before canceling the invoice I have changed the parameters to(please refer below screenshot)

.
Scenario:
Step 1: Invoice created and output not generated (output condition record was not maintained)
Step 2: Maintained output condition record
Step 3: Cancel the invoice > At this moment output for the original invoice is generated –> This has to be fixed. Due to this, original invoice is again emailed to the customer,
And here while canceling original invoice outout is generating and mail triggering to the customer.
Is this is the expected behaviour of SAP ?.
Please help me on this if it is an error how to correct it.
Thanks in Advance. 
--Sachy .
Output happens however you configure it to happen.  There might be some logic in the form that determines if it happens and/or in the program associated with the form.  It also determines the type of output.  The old nast way of doing things or the new OPD configuration.
The first thing to do would be to look at the configuration.   How is it set up there?
And then if you aren't a developer, go find one and see how the smartform/PDF (and hopefully not SAPScript is set up) 
In other words there usually isn't a "standard way".  It the way your company configured/developed the output.

why not define those as dynamic fields in mapping through UDF and then use them in REST receiver channel as "pattern variable replacement" through "adapter specific attribute".
I am struggling to get hierarchy extractors to replicate into BW4HANA 2.0 from ECC6.0. Text and Attribute extractors replicate ok, with some initial difficulty replicating and installing source-system dependent content, which I solved with an ECC note. I have tried all methods to replicate hierarchy datasources, from the tcode RSDS, to RSA1, to eclipse. I was able to see one of the datasources I wanted 0PROD_HIER_LPRH_HIER listed in RSA1 on "update data sources" a couple of times, but nothing happened after the replicate operation.
I tried the program BS_ANLY_DS_RELEASE_ODP to expose it to ODP. It is also on the list of ODP 1.0 datasources. I know that ODP 1.0 can be problematic with hierarchy datasources, but updating ECC might not be possible at the moment. I don't want to give up and do a flat file or generic-style extractor for something which should come out of the box. 
Short of updating ECC 6.0 EHP 5 or creating a load of custom workaround generic extractors that will get replaced when we eventually go to ODP 2.0, what should I do?
For hierarchy support in ODP-SAPI (DataSources / Extractors) Source Systems (ERP, CRM, SCM, etc.) that only use the ODP Data Replication API 1.0 please implement SAP Note 2418250. For more information see also SAP Note 2480284.
I have a situation, and I need your help. 
I have a two different material documents number with the same reference number, this is not normal because it material document number should have its own reference number. 
I have created a report where i had to join two tables to see the have all the document numbers with the dates and their reference numbers, and i can see that there two different document numbers with the same reference code. 
My question now, how can I, in a specific date , how can i be informed automatically if such scenario happened

Hi,
I am worked on a desktop application by Visual Studio 2022 and it uses crystal report for generating report. Now, I am trying to deploy this application with Visual Studio setup project. When I tried to install the setup on a client machine and tried to generate a report, it's failed. Below is error message.
---------------------------An error has occurred while attempting to load the Crystal Reports runtime.
Either the Crystal Reports registry key permissions are insufficient or the Crystal Reports runtime is not installed correctly.
Please install the appropriate Crystal Reports redistributable (CRRedist*.msi) containing the correct version of the Crystal Reports runtime (x86, x64, or Itanium) required. Please go to http://www.businessobjects.com/support for more information.---------------------------

Hello Guys,
Hope you all are doing good. i am facing an issue with Condtion type update in Sales order after i reduce the quanity.
I have created a new condition type for which the calculation is based on routine. 
Now when i create a order of lets say for eg:- 20 Qty and i create a partial delivery and billing of 10Qty. And after that customer refuse to purchase remaining 10 qty, so business is reducing 10 qty from an order.
now the issue is when the quanity is reduce from 20 to 10, all the condition type price are automatially updated according to 10 qty, just one condition type for which we are determining value based on routine, that prices is not updated and remains same as 20 Qty. 
Now the twist is, before creating any delivery when the Quanity is reduced from 20 to 10, it works fine.
Request you to please advise on the same. 
Since it is a custom routine, you need to check with your ABAP team to fix the issue.  But it is not at all recommended to reduce the remaining open order quantity in sale order; instead, you can set Reason for Rejection so that this will be helpful from Managements' perspective to generate a report to see how many such sale orders have this issue.
First of all, my call name is Lakshmipathi.
Now coming to your query, as I already said, since it is a custom routine, only your ABAP team can fix this, if your client are not accepting for Reason for Rejection but try to convince your client by adopting to standard functionality rather depending on custom validation which is always prone to pricing inconsistency
I have already indicated my call name is Lakshmipathi
Not sure, what logic is adopted.  Did you consider KONV table from where you can fetch unit rate & net value of each line item ?
Apart from the Alt. Calc. type routine, have you checked for the Calculation type in V/06? is it based on quantity?
Hi,
Currently my planning report is having multiple version. where I need to create a data action to copy F1 version data and to paste in F2 version. which will be on the basis of user selection like which data need to copy like P1,P2, Q1,Q2 etc. But my problem is when I try to create data action and selecting from source, it is not showing me Version in dropdown of dimension. I have tried by scripting also but version dimension is not visible. what could be the possible issue?

 

Hi there,
Please view: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ANALYTICS_CLOUD/00f68c2e08b941f081002fd3691d86a7/b5720be6f2ed41178762973df9e4af16.html?locale=en-US.
Target version is already a default prompt so in your filter of your data action, create a filter with source version. Now when you run the data action it will prompt for both target version as well as the source version.
Jay
Thanks!

Hello,
My issue is that when printing a workorder Shop Paper in PM the operations that have been printed before are missing. This is caused by the checkbox Delta Print being marked by default. In normal situations we want to make it work the other way around. We always want to have all operations printed and only occasionally (probably never) we want to exclude the former printed operations to be removed from print.
I work for a big enterprise and changes to the default system are not easy.
So what I would like to know if I can 'overwrite' the system settings on the Delta Print setting for shoppapers. Maybe a parameter or some other personal setting. If not can this be customized that this is controlled by a parameter?
Thank you
Anyone knows which data sources should I include to create (joined or combined) data source to create an Sales Target net value vs Net value report in SAP Bydesign.
Have a look into the standard reports and data sources for sales planning / sales target setting in ByD. They provide key figures for Target value and Actual Net value either for sales orders or invoices e.g.:
You find similar reports and data sources also for invoices,.

Hi experts,
we created a survey with the characters anonymous and optional.
This survey had been assigned to users who took part in the scheduled course.
Some of the users have started the survey, other not.
Now we decided to change the characters of this survey from optional to mandatory and made the changes direct at the survey.
But users who had assigned the survey before we made the changes have still the survey as optional assigned.
If we go to the item and mark there the survey as mandatory we get the warning, that all optional assigned surveys will be deleted.
Once you have cleared the optional assigned surveys you cannot assigne the survey which is now mandatory again to the same users.
Is there a possibility to reassign the survey (wich is now mandatory) to the users?
Regards

Hello Guys,
I'm trying to alert a query that will function if the U_DFrom table is less than 30 days to U_DTo table. Since Im new to Hana the usual Datediff will not work and im getting error using DAYS_BETWEEN function. Cannot find any example that the DATE_BETWEEN is in Where section.
Thanks for the help.
Here is my code.
SELECT T0."U_ComN", T0."U_ContN", T0."U_DFrom", T0."U_DTo", T0."U_Remarks" FROM "LIVEDB"."@ITDOCMAS" T0 WHERE DAYS_BETWEEN (TO_DATE (T0."U_DFrom", 'MM/DD/YYYY'), TO_DATE(T0."U_DTo", 'MM/DD/YYYY'))< '30'<br>
Hi,
Try this:
Hope this helps,

You don't need to use the DATE_BETWEEN function for this. Instead, use the DATEDIFF function.


The above query will return all rows where the difference between the two column values is less than 30 days.

Dear Experts,
I had posted the Inbound delivery in ECC system and IDN successfully reflected in the EWM system, but Partner roles are not determining automatically in Inbound delivery notification and Inbound delivery.
I had maintained the proper Partner roles and Partner Profiles in configuration.
Can anyone help me out, how will trigger partner roles automatically in IDN and ID.
Thanks in advance.
Oh well yes, WE, LF etc. is mapped in coding by SAP itself. First of all, check whats coming from ERP to EWM. Stop the Queue (smq2) and check whats in the Header Partner Table: 
LF is the Supplier (shipped from party). If that is fine, you can set the following breakpoint: Class SCWM/CL_MAPIN_ID_SAVEREPLICA Method CREATE_HEADER. You can set it right onto header_party:

In there, you gotta jump into the method header_party_line. That is where the magic happens.
So there is the acutal mapping: 
Out of that Method you will get ET_PARTYLOC where the ship-from-party should be SFPRT afterwards.
If the partner Role is LF in the Header Tab, PARTYNO will automatically be written in the item aswell. I guess LF is not send or you get some kind of custom partner role. Hope that helps. 
Hi, 
did you do the mapping for the partner roles?

Hi,
This is part of Standard Enhancement done for 1608. Basically if there is any code implemented in "Validation-OnSave" and no technical message has been raised on save reject then this message will give the idea to user saying that this is due to some particular solution. If you do not want to see such technical message then please raise a custom message inside ABSL Script and then as soon as technical message is raised then this Standard Message will not appear.
Please find the attached slide snapshot for more details.

In some apps, such as Manage Billing Documents, although the user can customise the layout of the output table the options to save the layout are missing (normally there would be a menu beside the heading "Billing Documents"):

Hi community 
I have a call transaction in loop to F-03 transaction and sometimes i receive a message :
Account 111111 is currently blocked by user YYYYYY
Are there a function or a way to see if account is blocked and i can use while command and exit of this while when the account is unblocked?
Thanks
You might use fm ENQUEUE_READ to check what locks are currently set in the system.
But it's not a good idea to use it in a loop, on and on, just in order to exit that loop. If you are able to spot a message like: "Account 111111 is currently blocked..." then why do you need to check this once again by calling some other function ? If your loop is able identify that message (returned by "call transaction" I suppose) then it's enough to decide whether to exit or not.

Did someone face similar issue?
In Foundries :(We use discrete manufacturing)
Sand will be the major input,which will be required in accuracy upto 2digit decimal.eg : 1200.25kg
How can the variance posting be handled during month end as user will be posting the variance against any order,as they will not be able to track to the exact order against sand consumption has happened.
This leads to Cogi(reservation exceeded - error)
One way to avoid is to add sand as bulk material and post it against cost centre.
But adding as bulk,it won't have the settlement against the order (As the sand quantity is huge)-how can the costing be handled ? Or do you have any other solution for this variance posting ?
Hello community. 
We are looking for a way to do mass uploads of requirements in SolDoc after completing the initial load. The challenge we are facing is that this creates duplicate documents in some cases, so we are trying to find a way to address this issue. Please see below some further information: 
Problem Statement 
Mass upload of requirements in SolDoc for new / updated requirements is currently not possible as the baseline requirements, which already exist in SolDoc might be overwritten, duplicated or removed. 
Also, there is a change in the way L4 requirement IDs are generated now compared to how they were generated earlier. Because of this, the requirement ID changes. This might lead to additional issues during mass upload. 
We are looking for a way to be able to use the mass upload program safely without impacting the requirements / structure already existing in SolDoc. 
Right now, we are manually adding requirements in SolDoc. 
Screenshot of L3 and L4 Structure at this point of time: 
 L3 structure : 

L4 Structure: 

Is there any way we can automate the upload of requirements without compromising the structure and / or the currently uploaded requirements?

Hello,
According to the standard system behavior a warning message is issued in VA01 when user creates the return with reference to invoice.
If a return already exists, then message V1499 ("There are already returns for item &1: &2 &3") will be issued and the enduser have to accept it.So the enduser can decide what to do: continue or abort return order. If they ignore the warning message, the system allows to create multiple Return order with reference to same invoice even if the return quantity is more than the invoiced quantity. Message V1499 is a warning message, it cannot be configured as an error message.One of the options is to change standard coding directly in program FV45EF0V_VBEP-WMENG_PRUEFEN_FO to change V1 499 to error message.Please note this would count as modification. If the user would modify the order quantity field in VA01 transaction then the system would also issue message V4229 ("Item 000010: Order quantity &1 greater than billed quantity &2) as another warning messae. This message could be changed to error in transaction OVAH. The user could lower the quantity then or exit the transaction. However, this option only works if the user does try to modify the order quantity. Relevant KBA:2582858 - Return more quantity than invoice quantity - message V1 499

Hi Jagadisha, we have two types of flow, Logout Flow and Reset Flow. If you are expecting reset the client to pre-onboarding status, you should call our Reset flow. After reset flow is triggered, the client will need to go through the onboarding process again. The Logout Flow is only for ending the current WebSession and OAuth tokens. After Logout flow is completed, when the app is opened next time, the user needs to enter the passcode to login to business application screen.

If your requirement is pass the device to different user, then you have two options here, 
- if your client application is using single-user mode, then you need to call Reset Flow to totally clean the onboarding information for previous user, and the new user need to do onboarding again. 
- We have also multiple user mode supported in 4.0, if your client application enabled multiple user mode, then the toggle user is a very easy task. you can refer to below document for multiple user mode sign-in screen for more details, https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/features/onboarding/android/fiori-screens/multi-user-signin-screen.html.

We want to have a component in the BOM which we wont be consuming, but we would need to have an ATP check happen on it. System needs te reserve the component, but once the order is completed the component should be available again.
We looked into Material PRT's. But there the ATP check wont take other open orders into account. (It doesnt reserve the stock)
Other option is recursive BOM for this component. But there the constant material postings are not ideal.
Is there a better solution?

Hi @Priyanka Miripelli
As given in the error screenshot, you should do the code value mapping for OCCUPATION and PAY SCALE AREA.
If you are using PTP replication framework, try below option: 
Personnel Management -> Integration Setting for SuccessFactors Employee Central Payroll-> Assignment of Code Values -> Maintain Code Value Mapping.
Before doing the code value mapping, define its properties using: 
Personnel Management -> Integration Setting for SuccessFactors Employee Central Payroll-> Assignment of Code Values -> Maintain Code Value Mapping Properties.

Hello Chaabene jellali
You are comparing apples and oranges...
Sales order price is a price at which you sell goods; this is the value of your future invoice. Whereas goods issue value is your cost of sell. 
Of course the sales order value should be larger than the value goods issue value, so you can make some profit on the sales. However, technically, there is nothing wrong if that is not the case - you are just loosing money on the sales transaction. 
Refer to Neeraj Jain on how GI is valued. Also check your SD pricing procedure and make sure your pricing conditions are correct. 
Best regards
Dominik Tylczynski
If you want to restrict this, go to pricing procedure where you maintain routine 5 under the tab "AltCTy". By doing so, system will trigger a message that the price is below cost and the users can take a call accordingly
Hi,
 In SE80 Function Group is showing, when i double click that it showing Function Group does not Exist. In Function Group does not contain any Includes. When i try to delete that Function Group it showing Function Group does not Exist. 

When i Maximize the Function Group it showing Object list 000000000038 does not exist. I tried in TRDIR,TLIBT,PROGDIR Table, But my Function Group does not exist in that tables. I want to delete that Function Group.

Thanks,
Karthick
Hi,
 Resolved by myself. Just Package->Other Functions->Rebuild Object List.

Thanks,
Karthick
Hi,

Go to SE37, In the Menu bar Goto--> Function Groups --> Delete Group.

Arivazhagan S
Did you delete the transport request in which this function group was attached?
Can you recreate the function group and then try to delete it again?
Regards, 
Tunwiir
Do one thing in Se80. Right click on function ground -> Choose other functions-> Rebuild list  see if it works.

Or an alternative can create a function group of same name and then delete
Hi everyone,
We are working on DataActions on SAC with Advanced Formula.
I would like to make an Integer become a string.
In our situation, we use a loop on a "Months" dimension inputed with zero. ["01","02","03"...]
So we would like to convert 1 to "01". 
This is an example but the conversion is not working : "0" + @VarMonth === "01"
INTEGER @VarMonth = 1 


FOREACH [d/Months]  

   
  DELETE([d/Months] = "0" + @VarMonth )
  @VarMonth = @VarMonth + 1 


ENDFOR
Have you any idea please ?
Thank you.
Hi Guillaume,
I think it is not possible to convert Integer to String rather you can convert Dimension to Measure.
Hi All,
is there a solution to this problem? I got a similar requirement where I got the month number stored as measure but need it in a LINK function as dimension/string value.
Thanks and best regardsAxel
Dear SAPians,
I have created a program using Module Pool and Getting one Error in Code Inspector Showing That 'Numeric or date fields are scrollable', When I double click on the error it's come to the Element List of the Screen. 
I don't get the Error. I'm scared because when I release the TR from the DEV System It gives me a warning.
Please help me regarding this issue.
Thanks & Regards,
Pranay Maity.


I see that the field ZWRDT-CNDT is set as Scrollable (and as you can see yourself in the details). But the error is about date and numeric fields. You have no good reason to have date and numeric fields scrollable, right?
Could you check if you have date and numeric fields scrollable?
I have a Fiori app made with UI5 components.

Hello experts,
I am getting status code HTTP 400 error while sending the CSV as body via the HTTP call to the receiver . The error does not appear if i remove the XMLTO CSV converter and just pass the XML in the body. I am passing the headers Content-Type- text/csv & x-ms-blob-type-BlockBlob in the HTTP receiver request headers. Any help will be highly appreciated.
Thanks in advance
Hi, 
the receiver is trying to tell you that it doesn't like your message body :) HTTP 400 is Bad Request. Please check with your target application/platform if it accept this message body and/or Content-Type first. 
BR, Piotr 
Hello Sabyasachi Mohapatra, I concur with Piotr Radzki's observations.
In addition, based on your situation, it appears that a white space character may have been inserted in the inbound payload (i.e., \u0001). I suggest removing this whitespace expression before using the XMLtoCSV converter.
Meanwhile, would you share the message monitoring error logs?

Hello CC Team,
do we have update on the sizing guidelines for the SAP Convergent Charging 5.0.6?
The link on the configuration doc from the version 5 is forwarding to the sizing guidelines from the version 4.0:

cg.pdf (sap.com)
SAP Convergent Charging 4.0 Sizing Guidelines
Many thanks,
Isaque
Hi Isaque,
This PDF document is no longer maintained, so you won't find any newer versions.Still, starting from CC 5.0, you can find generic instructions in the Installation guide, in the section entitled "Installing a multi-host landscape":https://help.sap.com/docs/Convergent_Charging/d1d04c0d65964a9b91589ae7afc1bd45/4ecf320714534ddb844b6dae7ff3815f.html?version=5.0.4&locale=en-US&q=high%20availability
Then, if you require a precise sizing for a production system, can you please open a support ticket?There, you'll be asked details about the expected volume and proportions of the data (e.g., number of contracts/counters/allowances/tables per account, number of rows per tables, etc.).To help you plan all this in advance, please also refer to SAP note 2478958 ("Impact of the master data on the SAP CC performances"). It gives precise figures to help you maintain a viable volume of data for each type of objects, and this is very likely to influence your design choices.
Best regards.

Hi Experts,do you know if there is any possibility to change respectively customize the layout of the WBS-Element Overview screen in the Project Builder (CJ20N)?Is it possible to add an extra Tab to the existing Basic Data, Organization, Responsibilities, Control, Overview?Is it possible to set the columns in the Tab?The only possibility to "customize" the screen I know at the moment is shown in the image below.
Background: I want specific columns so I can create a excel template from which I can copy paste my WBS-Elements with all duty fields. I know it is possible with the overview tab, however it is vulnerable to error.

Hi,
I am using sap.m.ComboBox in our application. And to fetch the countries name in ituse oData Model. It is fetching the data (Country Name) in the control but not all countries items.(sap.m.ComboBox shows only 100 countries).
And I try to see the data which is attached to the sap.m.CoboBox control in console
by using this code sap.ui.getCore().byId("countrolName").getModel().oData
it is also showing the 100 countries. (But in database shows 200 countires)
Please suggest something to show all the items(data) in sap.m.ComboBox.
Thanks & RegardsSomdutt Sharma
Hi Somdutt,
The default size limit of the model in combobox is 100.
You need to change the sizeLimit of the model explicitly before setting the model to the control.
Hey Somdutt,
 
I just wrote an Blog article about this subject so I wanted to propose one more solution which should be a little more elegant.If you want you can set sizeLimit per Binding. Just add parameter length to your Binding and your fine:
 
 
Works also in Java-Script:
 
 
Maybe this is something which doesn't have that much side effects than setting sizeLimit for a Model globally.
 
Also if you're interested see my whole article here

Can someone please assist me in a way to check for duplicate inbound deliveries please??
Hello Channel Du Plessis,
The inbound deliveries created with reference to purchase order/STO etc. for the quantities you want to purchase/transfer. After receiving complete quantity with tolerance system doesn't allow to make another inbound delivery as happen OTC process for the outbound delivery.
Please describe business case in which duplicate inbound are created to analyze further. Is your system allows to create multiple/duplicate deliveries once the quantity is completed? However, please check table EKBE if you get results as you are looking for.

Hi all,
We're trying to implement a process but not sure where to start.
Our current process example: 
We receive 100KG of product A but due to schedules, we split that amount at GR into sperate batches at whatever amounts. Once a batch has been tested, it's then released for use from our Quality team. 
The issue is from a physical point of view, products and batches could get mixed up due to other processes.
The idea:
Can the whole 100KG of product A be booked in as one batch (i.e batch BI00001) then as the Quality Team tested say 25KG x 4 for example, be released with a sub batch (i.e batch BI00001-A, batch BI00001-B etc.).
If this is achievable, please can we have some clarification on how?
Thanks in advance for all answers! :)

Hi Experts
We have a requirement in SuccessFactors-->Separation/Exit portal, to display a "Instruction" message as a pre-requisite to maintain their right information before submitting user's resignation. 
Is it possible to create and display instruction in separation portal? if so kindly share your inputs.
Thanks
Arun
Hi Karen Perez 
In the SuccessFactors separation/termination, we like to display a static message for the separation initiators.
We are displaying user's contact and address information and we like to display a static message as "if there is any change/update in their contact and address information, kindly get it updated in personal information".
Does separation page can able to display static message? 
Thanks
Arun
Hi Arun:
Displaying Instructions on any of the pages seems unavailable so far in EC. but still, you can look forward to the below workarounds. 
1. You can create a business rule to trigger a message, on initiation of Termination or after the selection of the Separation date. 
Thanks 
Sachin
Hi Sachin
Thank you for the suggestion, I already configured the rule to display message only for the current user and login user are same. 
Displaying instruction is very much possible in MDF, so was checking is there a work around to configure static message in standard feature. 
Thanks

Hi,

I'm new and still exploring in SAP Hana. I just want to know why I can't import a Catalog Object in the schema of the SAP Hana. If someone can help me do and resolve this error. 

Looks like you are using a user at the DB level that does not have the correct roles / privileges to perform the action you are trying to perform in that particular schema. 
Someone with sufficient DB access can modify your user, or give you a different user with sufficient DB rights for the schema in question (there is usually a DB admin team that can help with that). 
My question is,
Why we can't use list_display in hierarcical report ?

If I understand your query correctly, you mean to integrate a Translation tool in SMC so that you can translate an e.g. English email template to another language directly in the tool.

Hello,
can someone advise how to handle a difference in bank statement processing due to bank charges?I create a bank statement details page e.g. for 1 received payment for 1 invoice.Invoice amount is 1100 but incoming amout is only 1090 due to bank charges. The delta amount is higher than my accepted over and underpayment setting.
How do I deal with this situation?In manual incoming payment B1 would automatically post it to bank charges. However bank charges are not available in bank statement processing. There is only the fee amount columns but they seem only to be considered on top of the payment but not in reconciliation of invoice and payment?
Thanks for any input
Hi Team , 
Depreciation key LINE which is for straight line method, calculates depreciation day wise.
My customer is having an requirement, they want to use straight line method only but deprecation should calculate month wise . 
Can we do the changes for Dep key LINE or do we have another dep key which can be used for month wise ?
Thanks & Regards
Suhas
Hi Suhas,
In general changing and creating new keys in S/4HANA CE is not possible as written in HelpPortal, see topic here.
You can check the available key's settings in App 'Depreciation key:display details', from your summary I believe LINS will suit your requirement. But you should review all the available keys and decide which suits to your business the most.

Your error logs says.

Here, you have to initialize the system with ant initialize (this will delete ALL information, it is like starting from scratch). In case you have a license, use license.bat to install it.https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_COMMERCE/a74589c3a81a4a95bf51d87258c0ab15/8c49aad986691014afeea8e93299233a.html

Hi Experts,We have 4 message clients in SAP EVENT MESH but those are not visible in BTP under instances. Any idea, what could be the reason? 

Also, is it possible to create message clients without creating instances ? if yes, how we will get service keys ? 
Are you assigned as a member in the cloud foundry space? You need to be a member for the instances to be visible to you. 
Hi Mani Reddy,
the Event Mesh instances that you see in the Admin UI might be distributed across multiple spaces in the same CF Subaccount. Make sure you have access to all the space to see the service instances on BTP level.
Another option might be, that some of the message clients in your admin UI, are no instances of Event Mesh default-plan, but they might be instances of "SAP S/4HANA Cloud Extensibility" with plan "messaging" -> this will also create a messaging client.

Hello,
We have some questions about controlling area subject. Please find our questions below.
Thank you.

When we change IMG menu to standard GUI view with following path seen in Figure-1, we go to “Maintain Controlling Area” as it is seen in Figure 2 and 3. In Figure 4, we can choose new entries and create new controlling area. But when we want to assign company code to controlling area we can’t find the path like in GUI SPRO seen in Figure 5. We have found the note seen in Figure 6.

Question: Are we checking the wrong place? If not and the note in Figure 6 is valid, why is the new entry button active in Figure 4? What is this used for?
 

Figure 1
 

Figure 2


 
Figure 3
 

 Figure 4

Figure 5 – GUI SPRO Screenshot

Figure 6
 
2. If customer has 2 companies, how do we assign both companies to the same controlling area? Is it automatically ssigned when we create the second company code as it is seen in Figure 7?


Figure 7
 
3. If customer has 2 companies and both of them use different chart of account and/or different fiscal year variant what will we do about controlling area? How the system will work if there is only one controlling area? What is the solution?
Hi Deniz，
Good Day，

B，R
Gary
So your actual question is about “ If customer has 2 companies and both of them use different chart of account and/or different fiscal year variant what will we do about controlling area?  How the system will work if there is only one controlling area? What is the solution?” and "If customer has 2 companies, how do we assign both companies to the same controlling area?",
if so, please refer to this link for your question about different COA and FYV: Controlling Area | SAP Help Portal, which gave out a clear instruction on how to deal with different COA and FYV.
As for how to assign both companies to the Controlling Area, don't worry, company codes will be created under 1 controlling Area automatically.
Hi Deniz,
S/4hana cloud absolutely support more than one company with different fiscal year variant. When we talk about Fiscal year variant, it's a G/L accounting concept, customer use it for external accounting, especially for external accounting reports. In OP, we call it FI. please refer to this this Fiscal Year and Fiscal Year Variant | SAP Help Portal.
As for Controlling Area, it is a concepts of management accounting for internal management usage. Further, with universal journal, management accounting relevant reports can be generated from universal journal with different Fiscal Year Variant already. 
If you have further concern, please give out an example, we can discuss it in detail. Thanks

Hello folks,
I was using Eclipse 2022-09 and ADT Version 3.28. Debugger was working fine for a long time and I was able to debug the RFCs (moving from one SAP system to another). 
However, yesterday I upgraded to Eclipse 2022-12 and ADT Version 3.32 (The JRE version also upgraded to 17 in the process). Since then, while the debugger is working fine, but while debugging RFC and moving into another system, the debugger fails and shows 'source not found'. 

I also tried doing 'Edit Source Lookup Path' and adding the other system as an ABAP project in the Lookup Path, but it still doesn't work. 
It should not be a problem with the Backend SAP system itself, because it was working fine earlier. Please help resolve the issue. 
I did a fresh install of Eclipse for Java Developers 2022-12, with just ADT Latest Plugin and nothing else. The problem still persists. 
Below is the Error log details, if it helps : 
Hello Ravi,

Hi,
I have a question regarding to the webservices in the SOAMANAGER. We are planning to implement some sort of report,  which should automatically update the different parts of the webservices (the url, the ip adress etc.) located in the soamanager. Right now, we are updating our webservices manually and this takes some time. We searched for long time on different forums and we did not find anything that would help us with our request. Maybe some of you have a similar project going on and found a good basis to develop a report which completes the tasks described above.
Kind regards,

Looks like the columns used to create the level based hierarchy had some blank values. You should fill those blanks  with some values.

Hello,
I´m working on an integration flow where i execute an HTTP Request and retrieve some info, the i transform that information to a new structure that is sent to the SAP Backend using an OData service.

I´m trying to send this payload to the OData service, the payload was configured on the content modifier 2.

I have tested this payload on the Gateway client and Postman and seems to work fine, i got status 201 created and the response body correctly.

However, when trying to do the same on SAP CPI i´m getting the next error, when executing the OData request:
Error Details com.sap.gateway.core.ip.component.odata.exception.OsciException: Request Payload Parsing Failed for one of the reason: (1) Either the OData metadata content available in the server is outdated OR (2) The request payload seems to be incorrect. Error Details : Entity Set entry not found in the edmx.



The OData adapter is configured to process a POST.

Checking the IWFND/TRACES the request executed a GET, but not the POST with the payload shown above.

What´s the right way to execute POST to an OData service?
Hi Sergio,
The OData adapter converts the xml into Atom format and sends to backend service. Where as you are trying to send atom xml directly to odata adapter which is causing the problem. 
You generate/build the xml based on xsd generated from adapter level. That should work.
Hi Sergio,
The reason why you see GET and not POST in IWFND/TRACES is because internally for POST call ODATA adapter perform the first GET call to fetch the x-csrf-token and then do the actual POST call with the fetched data.
So as suggested above try to push data in simple xml format, if the problem still persists try to delete the existing edmx file and generate a new one using ODATA modeller of the channel and then re-push the data.
Thanks,
Manoj
Hi Sergio,
As suggested by Anil and Manoj, try deleting the existing edmx from the resources and generate new one from the OData adapter to post data in simple XML. As an alternative you can try creating a simple mapping using generated edmx file in the target structure to post data. I hope Odata service has creatable- true enabled in the backend.

Pavan
HI Sergio,
Can you try with below payload. I may be wrong on ConsultaTrm field. If it doesn't work generate xsd in receiver odata adapter by enabling check box "Generate XML Schema Definition"

Just search. The answer is in the ABAP documentation of FILTER ... WHERE c1 op v1 [AND c2 op v2 [...]].

Hello experts,
The FM SCMS_AO_TABLE_GET is being used in a report to check if the attachments in the Purchase requisition are corrupt or not, Was curious if any other FM could be used instead of this one to find if attachments are corrupt? 
Based on your latest comment ("The same FM is behaving differently for development system and production system ie. for the same document ID, it gives corrupted in Prod but non-corrupted in Development. Even though the inputs being passed are same"), you should debug why it behaves differently in both systems. The reason is not due to the ABAP code but to the configuration in your 2 systems.

hi All,
I have a requirement to send json data to an Odata service in SAP ECC system using OData adapter in SAP CPI. As Odata receiver adapter accepts only XML input, I have converted the payload from json to XML and then sending to OData. During this conversion, an XML root node is added to make the XML valid as there are multiple records. 
Is there any way to remove this 'root' node addition before sending it to OData adapter? 
json payload :{"shipperRefDocuments":[ { "docId":"000000600", "shipment_id":"", "docType_code":"" }, { "docId":"", "shipment_id":"", "docType_code":"" } ],"eta":"","actualTechnicalTimestamp":"","logicalSystem":"","Shipment":"","transportationMode_code":""} 
 Integration Flow:

Any inputs would be much appreciated!
Hi, 
yes in this case JSON to XML converter will enforce usage of root element. You can retrieve payload without root element after the conversion with simple XSLT.

After system upgrade it is not possible to create an attachment with ’Service for Objects’ menu in the display sales transactions (VA03, VA23, VL03N, VF03, etc.). Generic Object Services creation is not working in display mode anymore.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
Creating an attachment is supposed to be a change activity, which should not be allowed in display mode. The SAP development team has intentionally switched off the attachment button in display mode with the justification that it is incorrect.
These changes were published with SAP Note 2986839.
The note is part of the standard coding on higher releases now, so after SAP upgrade you can experience the changes.
This is the standard SAP behaviour according to the updated code. The previous design was an error, so it had to be changed.
To add attachment, you will need to open the sales document in change mode (e.g. VA02).The user requires the necessary authorizations to access the sales document for changing to add GOS attachments.
If you want to get the previous behavior back, then you can revert the code changes of SAP Note 2986839 as a modification on the affected Form. For a modification keep in mind note 170183.
Hi,
It seems like for some apps on BTP, we need Cloud Foundry Space but no memory quota is used. So we created a space and it now sais that we have 50GB of memory.

We did not buy memory. So probably we can not use it to deploy apps. Will there be a message when trying to use it that it is not possible and in general can we overconsume quotas? I am a bit affraid that somebody uses it and we have to pay.
How do you solve this? Assign a quota plan woth 0 GB?
This is the default quota in case none is assigned. 
What kind of account is this? CPEA? Free tier?
In case of CPEA you have assigned cloud foundry runtime entitlements to you subaccount (could be done automatically but not sure). Nevertheless, as long as you don’t use it, you won’t have to pay for it. As soon as you consume it will measure your monthly consumption and deducted from your credits.
For free tier you get some runtime for free but I don’t think it’s that much. 
Hi Mark,
I'm working to get a more authoritative reference for you, but BTP Subscription accounts are structured as a commitment for a specific set of named resources and services. Your organization is invoiced for those resources based on the commitment, not actual use. There's three account types in BTP: Subscription, Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement (CPEA) and Pay-as-you-Go (PayG). Of the three, the PayG model is the consumption-based pricing model. (see https://www.sapstore.com/medias/Pay-As-You-Go-Free-Tier-Model-for-SAP-BTP-FAQ.pdf )All that said, I'm unsure where the "50GB" number in the Cockpit originates in your case. In a PayG account, that value would have been allocated as an Entitlement for the subaccount you are operating in. Entitlements are allocated at the subaccount level, not per-Space. I don't have access to a Subscription account to see what might be different there, but I'm checking with the BTP product team to get you a more authoritative answer.
Are you, by chance, the person who created the subaccount? If not, you might check with them and ask if they added any specific entitlements to the subaccount.
I hope this helps explain at least part of it.
Regards,
Riley
Thanks, Mark. I'm still looking for a clearer explanation, but a BTP Subscription based account should always have a fixed cost -- it follows that your list of services in the Subscription sets the limit of consumption of each resource. I hope to hear back soon.
Hi Mark,
Would you message me via e-mail: firstname.lastname@sap.com -- I have some folks teed-up to investigate this and I need a few extra details.
Thanks,
Riley

Hi everybody,
I would like to use a special sort sequence for my putaway strategy.
Here is my example: 
I have defined three bins with my activity area CLSP: 
Bin 01-01-01 with Bin -Type A - Sort Sequence CLSP 3
Bin 01-01-02 with Bin - Type B - Sort Sequence CLSP 2
Bin 01-01-03 with Bin - Type C - Sort Sequence CLSP 1
I aim to putaway in bin 01-01-03 first. 
When I start my putaway process with HU-Type 01, I am getting always Bin - Number 01-01-01 first, because the search sequence for HU-Type / Bin - Type found Bin-Type A first.
I thought the sort number for CLSP has the main priority?
Does anyone have more experience with this issue? 
Thanks. 
Regards
Daniel 
Hi,
"I thought the sort number for CLSP has the main priority?"
Not really...
If you use things for the determination inside a storage type, like storage section or bin type, these are determined first. Inside lets say the first determined bin types, the sorting with CLSP is then used to search for bins. Starting with the first one which is there, after that CLSP controls the sequence.
So if you have an HU type which is using bin type A first, this is being used first.
BUT: do you use a HU type check or anything with bin types at all? Because there is a bug (in my opinion). If you assign bin types, the search sequence the system builds up always looks into the first bin type (whatever is "first". If you use A, B, C, this is the sequence. If you use E1, E2, that is also the sequence. It is just sorting this alphabetically / numerically). And this happens even if not bin type search / HU type check is active. Again, in my opinion it is a bug. On the other hand you can say that if you do assign bin type, you probably also do some determination using them.

Hi Jürgen,
I am using one storage type with HU-Type-Check. All bins I mentioned are assigned to one storage type. My problem: The systems goes to table /SCWM/T303S and take the first sequence entry for the possible combination of HU-Type/Bin-Type and the sorting is not being considered. Our goal is to have the bin sorting done first then subsequent check for the HU-Type permitted for the bin-type. 
Then the systems finds a pool of bins with the possible HU-/Bin-Types combination. Do I have the sorting in the pool of bins? 
 How can we archive our goal?
Thanks. 
Regards
Daniel
Hi Jürgen, 
I deactivate my HU-Type-Check and I get the same result. Maybe it is a different logic, If I am using bulk storage? My storage type is one. 
Regards
Daniel
Thanks Jürgen. I will open an OSS-Note and ask SAP for a solution.

Now I would just like to know if the poll failure errors are stored somewhere in the system that I could call so that some form of notification can be setup. I think it is known that poll failures for sender SFTP are not sent to exception subprocess as the whole iFlow goes into error status. To my knowledge the MessageProcessingLogs API is only filled up of errors that are failed during iFlow runtime so I assume poll failure are not store there. Correct me if I am wrong.
Any input is highly appreciated.

Regards,
Joel
Everything that you see in CPI monitor can be retrieved with MPL OData CPI API. Do you failed messages in CPI Monitor? Is it visible on Artifact monitor level in deployment? Does the error occur only during deployment? 
BR, Piotr 
hi Piotr,
MPL API never seem to store SFTP connectivity issues at least based on the dummy scenario I did and since API's overview referred only to messages processed in the tenant. 
I have my sender SFTP iflow polling every minute with no valid address so it fails repeatedly. When querying the API in Postman I did not get any details that refer to my SFTP iflow. I think I just confirmed my previous understanding about how the MPL API works.
Hi gurus,

Can you give me a sample code in which we have to post an FI document with CO-PA data using BAPI_ACC_DOCUMENT_POST. Currently I'm having trouble posting a document with profit segment. 

Thank you very much
Andre
Hi,

Here is a sample program which posts FI document along with CO-PA characteristics.


I hope this helps,

Hi,
The README.HTML provided for each SBP contains all the steps and precautions you need to take care. Besides this, we strongly recommend to read the corresponding SAP notes which also contains essential information, like:
2799920 - Patches for 19c: Database
2799930 - Patches for 19c: Grid Infrastructure
Besides these, it worth to read below SAP note, as it lists the known problems too:

Hi! 
Has anyone has any experience with setting up the business rule to restrict requested hours in Time Off? For example, employee requests a Time Type X where the duration is equal to 6 hours 46 minutes. However, we only allow to request for 6 hours, 6 hours 30 min, 7 hours, etc. Basically every half an hour. I was wondering if there is any possibility to round the value up? Or to set up a business rule like "if minutes not equal to 00 or 30 then raise an error"?
I would appreciate any advice in this! 
Hello Olga,
yes, both options exist. Here is an example on rounding: 
https://blogs.sap.com/2018/11/07/lets-do-rounding-without-any-lookup-tablemdf-useful-for-ec-time-off/
And if you check the implementation guide there are rounding examples as well.
You can also use business rule functions - but those create then just an error if the employee did not record what you want him to record. So, both options exist - one is a rounding, the other one is raising an error and forcing the employee to enter the correct value.
And in the documentation you find other rounding rexamples, here it is for accruals, but you can use it in validation rules as well I guess:
Implementatioon guide
Best regards
Volker
Hi Volker
Thank you very much for this link. However, I'm not sure if that's possible for other scenario than Accrual. But I used another rule that is working - raise an error if number of hours is not equal to 1,2,3,4...etc. (Initally it was supposded to be half an hours as well but at then we only need full hours). Maybe it will be useful for someone:

Tutorials: https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-soap-web-services.html --------------------------  Hi experts,
aside from the tutorial above, is there other way ( still using eclipse ) to quickly check if a wsdl ( created in sap through soamanager ) is working as intended into target system?
I do tried it few years ago, however I can't exactly remember how to do it.
I also do remember vividly some of the steps ( but not as complex as the tutorial linked above, which require to code few lines of syntax) such as:
1. importing ( either the url / the file / the file content ) into eclipse project
2. setting the username log on and password in eclipse ( since i set the WSDL to something like medium level authorization )
3. change data , debug
although the main problem is, I lost the initial setup program, so I'm not sure which additional package I need to install in Eclipse before going through step 1 above.
Any idea of what is the exact package to be installed?
*note: currently I'm using the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers - 2022-12
Regards,
Siswanto
Hi Siswanto,
for more details regarding SOAP service consumption in the BTP ABAP environment, see SOAP | SAP Help Portal.
You are right there are three steps:
1) upload the WSDL file to the ABAP development tools (and create also some other ABAP coding and development artefacts, as guided by the development flow)
2) maintain the credentials of the remote service in our Admin Fiori tools ( aka create a "Communication Arrangement"). You can look e.g. at this tutorial step 9-12 for details Create an HTTP Service in SAP BTP ABAP Environment | Tutorials for SAP Developers
3) execute your code and test if the remote service can be called as expected.
For more details how to setup Eclipse, please see this tutorial Install ABAP Development Tools (ADT) and abapGit Plugin | Tutorials for SAP Developers or our documentation Getting Started as a Developer in the ABAP Environment | SAP Help Portal

Hey Guys,
I am using SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform 4.2 Support Pack 5Version: 14.2.5.2618 
I am trying to cut numbers after a specific word:

 I can see that the first part of evert sentance is the same: 27 charts from the beggining of the sentance until the number I want (the lenth of the number is different from row to row)
How can you create a variable that will cut only the amount shown from the sentence?
THANKS!
Hi Michal,
if start and end is always the same yo can use this
regards
Lothar
Hi Michal,
the point is that the ':' marks the start and 'Dollar' the end.
Substring needs start and length (difference between end - start ).
Have you tried the query with your values?
regards Lothar
Hi Michal,
It is an interesting problem, and I came up with this solution:
This assumes that the number is always to the left of the key word.
Regards,
Johan
Hi Johan,
I tried your query. It is verry interessting!
But where is to set the keyword? Why did you revered it? The line itself contains more than one numeric value.

SAP byd中销售计划和实际达成的管理，系统只提供了销售计划和同期间创建的订单金额及已开票额的比较，对于2022年创建的订单在23年才出库的部分无法统计出来。所以实际达成应该和同期间财务收入过账额对比才更有意义，BYD如何实现呢？
I would think that a binding to a destination service suffices to be able to resolve a subaccount level destination. There seems to be some bug or issue in my implementation failing it to work.cds.requires:
"CFAPI": {
        "kind": "rest",
        "credentials": {
          "destination": "CFAPI"
        },
        "destinationOptions": {
          "selectionStrategy": "alwaysProvider"
        }
      }
cds server.js:
const proxy = require('@sap/cds-odata-v2-adapter-proxy')
const cds = require('@sap/cds')

cds.once('bootstrap', (app) => {
  app.use(proxy())
  app.get('/favicon.ico', (req, res) => res.status(204))
})

cds.on('served', async () => {
  const { 'cds.xt.SaasProvisioningService': provisioning } = cds.services
  await provisioning.prepend(() => {
    provisioning.impl(require('./saas'))
  })
})

module.exports = cds.server 

Minimal reproducible saas.js (the provisioning implementation):
const cds = require('@sap/cds')
const appEnv = JSON.parse(process.env.VCAP_APPLICATION)

const cfApi = await cds.connect.to('CFAPI')
const domainResponse = await cfApi.get(
   `/v3/domains?names=${/\.(.*)/gm.exec(appEnv.application_uris[0])[1]}`
)
console.log(domainResponse)

 The connect.to was working at a certain point, but I am not succeeding in resolving it since it started failing.  
As you can see in the sample below, if I use the code within "TEST BEGIN" and "TEST END", the destination can get resolved and the HTTP request works. Do note, to make this work I had to remove the 'destinationOptions'.

Hi Pieter,
you are correct that a binding to the destination service should be sufficient. However, we inherited some bad practice from Java SDK that we get the tenant id from a binding to the XSUAA. We have a backlog item to remove this. Could you add a binding to a XSUAA service to the application to check if the error disappears? 
If so I will link this question to our backlog item and bring this up in the next planning that we do not postpone working on the issue.

I'm looking for a method or tool, similar to the Master Data Cleanup Wizard, for obliterating all Sales Orders and all Invoices. I am not interested in creating reversals or credit memos, in fact, I want to wipe those out, too.
I am asking if there's a pre-formulated SQL query that someone already has which can achieve this, without corrupting my installation.
This is a sandbox environment with a new CompanyDB that we are almost ready to put into production, but, I need a repeatable way to wipe out all the data from multiple rounds of testing
Hi Brian,
First, please take a deep breath, and count to a number as high as needed.
The system is more complex than it may seem. Deleting (or updating) data from system tables will have unexpected side effects that will become apparent sooner or later. The question is not if, the question is when. Just off the top of my head:
If your purpose is to start a completely new company database, you should just do so, and use the Data Transfer Workbench to copy relevant data, and/or use the tools Son Tran Van suggested in his answer to transfer settings.
If your purpose is merely to reduce the size of your company database, you should first look at the database settings, to see if the recovery model is set to 'Simple'. Otherwise you can use the Data Archive Wizard to do a controlled delete of old transactional data (older than 2 years).
Regards,
Johan
Hi,
You are not allowed to delete/update any data in the system by SQL scripts.

Hello Everyone,
Any leads on how to create Hook point in SAP DMC. as we know we can create Hook point in SAP ME in operation to call custom activity. I am new in DMC and I am not aware How we can create Hooks in SAP DMC.
Appreciate your help.
Thanks & Regards,
Sumit
I guess the hooks in ME were replaced by Plugin Extensions concept in DMC.
Hi Sumit,
You have to build a production process in SAP DMC to execute required logic. To trigger this you need to call this production process from button on the POD. 
Regards,
Vishal 
Agree with Vishal in that it is "replaced" with process designer. However, the only way I have seen to initiate these is through a POD button, as Vishal mentions. The question I have is what to do with what was previously a site level hook in ME. Example is when floor stock is received, inventory ID is created and you need to print a label so that it can be scanned. I see no place where you can initiate the printing production process not based on a POD button click. Same for label on order release - for that one I guess we need an operation at the beginning of the routing where we print the label/traveler from the POD.
Sorry to add question on to this thread, but thought it would be good to include in this one. 
Thanks Michael. We had looked at the triggers, but for PCo events. Thanks for the additional pointer to look at business rules. 
Just to add one more thing in case others need it. For the point regarding automatic triggers to initiate a production process based on business rules. There was no apparent one for inventory receipt, however I did notice that this seems to be available with 2208. So, will be able to test shortly.
You have to built a production process and trigger the production process from Automatic triggeres.
Hi All,
I have design a production process auto start and complete sfc and configure in Automatic Trigger of business process rule at first Operation it will start and complete the SFC and executing this production process from POD button but it is not stopping the start and complete at other operation.
Can anyone suggest ??

Thanks ,

Hi, we have had the same issue with SAP BO and Chromium, and Edge and Chrome was patched last week, but i still encounter an error, when i try to:
1. Access SAP settings menu
2. Change, create or delete auto generated reports
Depending on the browser, either a sad face, or a cloud is shown while the update wheel is rotating endlessly.
I have tried with Firefox to no avail, the error in Firefox is something like "Safe connectio failed, authentication error.
Has anybody a workaround?
Kind regards Daniel
the new BI 4.2 SP09 - Patch 1300 was released today and is available for download. it contains the solution to the problem.

Hi All ,

Can you please let me know which API/ASTM tables are used in Hydro Carbon Product Management and how to use them.

 

Thanks and Regards

Magesh,

Usage of ASTM tables depends upon the conversion group defined in configuration and ASTM file (Either standard with SAP or purhcased from ASTM), Ex :- 56A will be using TAB5a in ASTM file loaded in application server.
Few more examples are
Conv Table
Group in Astm
 234A tab23a 
 234A tab24a 
 234B tab23b 
 234B tab24b 
 234C tab24c 
 234D tab23d 
 234D tab24d 
 534A tab53a 
 534A tab54a 
 534B tab53b 
 534B tab54b 
 534C tab54c 
 534D tab53d 
 534D tab54d 
 56A tab5a 

Hope this explains , Please let me know in case u need more details

Dear Experts,

I have situation that systems resposes the error as below message. FYI I have done MMPV and my input is correct, I have checked in finance open and close period is correct as well. I need your assistance to guide me as per diagnosis below. 



Posting only possible in periods 2009/02 and 2009/01 in company code 0546
Message no. M7053

Diagnosis
The posting date entered is not within one of the permitted posting periods (current period/previous period).

This can be due to one of two reasons:

The correct current period has not been set in the system.
For the system, the first of the entered periods is the current period. At the beginning of a new period, your systems administrator must change the current period in the material master record, using the function "Shift periods". This has not yet been done.
You have entered a wrong date in the field "Posting date".
Procedure
Check the posting date and correct it if necessary. If your input is correct, inform your systems administrator that the "period shifting" (period-end closing) process has not yet been completed

Best regards,

Mahnansa
First check the Current period in OMSY trx...for your Comp code..
Then go to MMPV and enter Comp code, Period & Year
and execute...

Ex: if the current period in OMSY for your Comp code is 01,2008
then you need to enter period 02, 2008 in MMPV trx...
so, that period 01,2008 will be closed & Period 02,2008 will be opened automatically...
You need to close periods one by one like this..
until the period you want use...

Remember you can not Roll back the closed period
Be careful in closing the MM period in PRD client
Hi

Please check OMSY transaction for company code 0546 - periods in open and then open the period in MMPV transaction.

Thanks
Hi

Check it in the material master accounting view of any material and check the current period. if will show the period for cross checking purpose.
If any miss match close period in MMPV.

Regards,

Raman
Hi,

Check in OB52 for your company code weather the posting period is open or not.

else check the fiscal year variant maintained for your company code, wheather the first month is April or January.

If it is april then the posting period should be 11 for yuor fiscal year.

Regards,

Bharat.
hi,

Go to OB52, and enter the last three entries as 02,2009, 13, 2009, 16, 2009 and do this for all account types...

Please check this with the FI consultant as well...

Hope it helps..

Dear Experts,
Actually, already created tax codes in the system is up to V9. Govt. revised the GST rates and we have to create another input sales tax code but system not allowing to create V10 because i know we can create 2 digits tax codes only.
Need experts' opinion to cater this scenario. Is it advisable to create only 2 digits numeric code or create new code with change alpha character? Please advise..
Dear Khadim,
You cannot more than 2 characters in the tax code. Please check the length of the field highlighted in the snapshot:

However, you can continue creating a new code for e.g. "VA", "VB", "VC" etc.
Hi
The tax code can have two characters only. You could use two alphabets for the new tax codes.

Hi community,
is there a way to resize a given PDF document into another paper format? Alternatively, does someone know a way to convert a given PDF into an image format like tif or jpeg?
Background:we print some PDF documents (pp order related) and print some drawings of the part on the 2nd page. In past, these drawings has been stored in KPRO as tif document and the image was printed with an image container in ADS.Now they have been changed and are stored as PDF now. I was able to merge the newly created pdf (pp order document) with the existing drawing (PDF in KPRO) into one PDF document. But now I observed that the drawing uses a different paper format (DIN A2) whereas we print it as DIN-A4, which is 4 times smaller.
This causes two issues:1. as the merged PDF now uses different paper formats, it is one spool file but gets processed as different files by the printer. So the drawing is no longer on the 2nd page of the same sheet of paper (back side, duplex print). 2. as the paper format doesn't match provided paper format of printer (A4 only), only a part of the drawing gets printed (upper left corner)
Question
Does someone know a way to resize an existing PDF document in ABAP? The previously used image was automatically scaled down by ADS to fit into the image frame. 
Or does someone know a way to convert a given PDF file to an image format like tif or jpeg in ABAP? This way, ADS will scale the image as it did before.
I am facing a strange situation in a "List report" application. The application is based on standard OData with annotations. 
Suddenly, I find that the "Go" Button in the filters does not trigger a service call and no data is loaded in the table.

To test, I created another project and the list report works fine there. 
I am keen to understand the possible cause for this issue.

Hi Pardeep,

This can be controlled via customization transaction OMDT, where you can assign the document type to an MRP group in a plant. The MRP group is then assigned to the material master.

Hello Experts,
I have created a Process Automation which uses an Action to perform certain tasks in the backend. When process calls the Action all backend tasks are completed successfully, which suggests that Action has worked well. 
But when I check the instance of process it says that "Invoke action failed" and the instance goes into erroneous state. The backend we are using is CAP based. Attaching screenshot for reference. 

The error message doesn't convey details of issue.

Hello Girish,
We need additional information here.
As a first step, can you try sending the same data using the "Testing Actions" functionality within Actions Project ? or using a tool like postman to make sure right input is passed as per the expectations for the API.

2. Can you try the same API in postman and check if the API calls work on postman?
Hello  Girish Kumar Gupta 
Thank you for your reply.
I again wanted you to review X-CSRF mention in our documentation. At the. same time, I see your test on actions editor is successful. 
Can you also share your destination screen shot?

Hi Colleagues,
I am interested in using an external library (javascript-time-ago) in a Fragment for my Fiori Elements application. 
I have created a libs folder where I have npm installed the library. 

My TaskStatus.fragment.xml has an associated controller/handler in which I would like to use the library.

(As a side note, am I setting up my controller correctly here? I would be interested in using some of the native lifecycle methods that a controller offers). 
As shown, I have included the library path within the dependency array and yet receive an error in my dev tools console.


From the tutorial here I tried to adapt, it suggested providing the library’s source code file as opposed to including the entire library as I’ve done here, but I’m not sure what that path would look like. 
Any advice?
Thank you so much in advance!
Hello Sylvia,
When i imported a custom library before ina ui5 app, this is what i did.
1- Downloaded the source code in a libs folder in my project
2- Added an import in the Component.js file with the path like so "PROJECT_PATH/libs/FILE_NAME_WITHOUT_JS"
3- Added the same import again in my controller
4- Then you can just simply use it in your controller from there.
Unfortunately your uploaded images are not showing, so that i could help more.
Good luck.

But I have a problem in populating the username(changed by) and date(changed on ) for the event 01.The event is getting triggered but I am not getting how to populate the values in these fields.I had checked the SAP Help saying interntal tables TOTAL and EXTRACT needs to be used and finally sy-subrc should be set to zero.But,this TOTAL and EXTRACT are type LINE and not fieldwise.


form change.
DATA: F_INDEX LIKE SY-TABIX, "Index to note the lines found
      ls_wa type zani_table.
ls_wa = <vim_total_struc>.

LOOP AT TOTAL.
IF <ACTION> = 'U'.
ls_wa-aenam  = 'VIMAL'.  "for testing
ls_wa-laeda  = sy-datum.
READ TABLE EXTRACT WITH KEY <vim_xtotal_key>.
IF SY-SUBRC EQ 0.
F_INDEX = SY-TABIX.
ELSE.
CLEAR F_INDEX.
ENDIF.
MODIFY TOTAL.
CHECK F_INDEX GT 0.
EXTRACT = TOTAL.
MODIFY EXTRACT INDEX F_INDEX.
ENDIF.
ENDLOOP.
SY-SUBRC = 0.

各位专家老师好：
 有两个问题请教一下：
 一，S4HC 版本新公司上物料账有类似于OP版本CKMSTART的操作吗，或者应该注意那些操作要做呢？
 二，S4HC已上线公司前期物料账没使用，但物料账配置（包括移动类型重置等）都已经设置好，这种情况重新上物料账需要那些操作要做呢？
如有相关参考资料请发一下链接，感谢！
您好，
1. 物料账仅在已激活范围项目 33Q (实际成本) 时可用。参考测试脚本执行即可
2. 注意要进行实际成本核算的物料要满足：
应用“管理物料评估”或“显示物料”中的“物料价格确定”标识已设置为 “3（单级/多级）”。
应用“管理物料评估”或“显示物料”中的“价格控制”标识已设置为 “S（标准价格）”。
请在测试机上做充分测试

We're getting an error in a custom program after we call function 'BAPI_PO_CHANGE'. The return table has the error message 'No data record available in POACCOUNT; unable to copy from EXTENSIONIN'. I'm not sure how to fix this issue?
I've debugged into BAPI_PO_CHANGE and found that the error message is getting generated in post_processing by my_handler->get_list_for_bapi( ).
I'm not sure how to fix this though. POACCOUNT is not empty (it has two rows of data) so I'm not understanding why its saying no data records available. We're only getting this error on a few purchase orders so it isn't happening all the time.
Hello https://people.sap.com/abap_1920932,
It seems PO have deletion/ locked and completion indicator. If any of one indicator marked in PO then you can't change anything. Please check.

Dear Experts,
In an analytical application, I am looking for a way to reset some filters to the selection "All". For now I'm working with Input Controls (if you know a work around using other objects like filter line, I take it! already tried)
What I've done for now is an ugly work around: during onInitialization of the Canvas, I save members of the Input Controls I want to reset later, in global variables (member info, arrays):
init_members_Dimension1 = IC_Dimension1.getInputControlDataSource().getActiveSelectedMembers(99999);
 When I want to reset these fitlers, I feed these input controls the values in the global variables. 
IC_Dimension1.getInputControlDataSource().setSelectedMembers(init_members_Dimension1);
I see two problems of this method:
1. After resetting, the Input controls do not show neat "(All)", but a huge list of members
2. This is pretty ugly
Do you have any idea how to solve this?
Thanks a lot!
Stéphane

We are looking for VKM2 alternative in S/4 Hana Credit Management (FSCM)   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
In S/4 Hana systems, there is no transaction equivalent to VKM2.
S/4 Hana Credit Management system is not a feature-by-feature successor to the Classic Credit Management system.  Therefore, not all transactions in ECC systems will be available in S/4 Hana systems.
Hello,For SAP Credit Management (FSCM) the suggested way to manage credit blocked sales documents is to use DCDs. The DCDs associated with sales documents that have been released can be listed in SCASE / UKM_CASE / UKM_MY_DCDS transactions. In the DCDs you can find many details relevant for the credit check, credit value, responsible users, etc.Alternatively you could create a custom report to select the released orders and deliveries from tables VBAK and LIKP. On S/4HANA the credit status fields, credit master data fields and credit block release related fields are all in the sales header tables.For example you could use KKBER (credit control area), KNKLI (credit account), CMPS_CM (SAP Credit Management status), CMGST (Overall credit status, this should be equal to 'D' = released), CMFRE (date of release) and AMTBL (released credit value).Best regards,Edina
Additionally VKM4 is still available on S/4HANA. Transaction VKM4 lists all credit management relevant documents. You could create a variant for VKM4 to display only credit released sales orders and deliveries.

Hello all,
I implemented enhancement to show additional data for Letter of credit (vx11n, vx12n, vx13n, vx14n). I used enhancement RVEXAKK1 in my CMOD project. 
Function exits: EXIT_SAPMV86E_001 EXIT_SAPMV86E_002
Screen exits: SAPMV86E 0101 ZUSATZ SAPLXAKK 0100 SAPMV86E 0601 ZUSATZ SAPLXAKK 0100
I can see additional data is coming in vx11n/vx12n/vx13n, BUT the additional data is not appearing in VX14n transaction. 
Can you please help me, suggest what I am missing? Maybe different enhancement needed for VX14n? Hope for any help, Kristaps

We need to buy new Signavio Enterprise Licenses, but we don't know how to find the right tenant ID? We only find very long workspace ID's? Any recommendations how to solve that problem?
regards,
Carsten
Hi Carsten,
to purchase new licenses you have to contact your SAP Signavio Sales Manager or write an Email to sales@signavio.com
In my experience the Workspace ID should be enough. 
I can find my tenant ID in Signavio Process Intelligence under a Process, Settings and then API...there you can find also the tenant ID
Hope my answer helped.
Cheers 
Rada

Dear Carsten, 
please find in our documentation under Find the Workspace ID as description of how to find your workspace ID within the various SAP Signavio products. 
If you have further questions on your sales contact person you can also contact the Signavio Sales team under https://www.signavio.com/contact/ . Hope that helps and best, Cäcilia
Thanks so far! Does it mean i can only see the tenant ID in the PI module?
Hi Carsten, you can find your tenant ID in either the PI module, Hub or the Process Manager.

Dear SAC Expert,
Is it possible to create a calculated measure in the model to calculate the total number of headcount based on the active employee which has data populated in the model? Kindly advise.
Thank you.
Best Regards,
Yanice
Also I am not sure of what all dimensions you have in your model. You can try setting the exception aggregation Headcount  as Sum and in Exception aggregation dimension you can put all dimensions except time. That way you may not need second aggregation.
Nikhil 
Hi Nikhil,
Take below as an example. I would like to create a calculated measure (Eg. Number of Employee) which able to calculate the total number of employees from the same profit center & cost center. Is it doable to create such calculated measure in the model? The idea is once I pull the calculated measure "Number of Employee" into report, it should be able to show "2". Kindly advise.

Thank you.
Best Regards,
Yanice
Yanice Weng Yee Loh
Not sure if got the image right. You second column looks like an employee dimension. If you just create a Aggregation measure of type count dimension on this column it should give you a headcount. Else you can go for calculated measure like below over your employee dimension. You might have to create another aggregation on top of this to have an exception aggregation over time so that headcounts do not get added up across time but get aggregated over other dimensions like cost center, profit center etc.
Example is based on customer count
Aggregation Measure over above measure to get right aggregation

Output: Q1 count  is not getting aggregated but count over customer hierrachy is getting aggregated.

Hope this helps !!
Nikhil
Hi Nikhil,
Thanks a lot for the input. I think for our situation it's better to create a Aggregation measure of type count dimension in the model. We are actually building the report using SAP Analytics Cloud Microsoft Office Add-In, hence not able to create the calculated measure as suggested by you. Can you please advise if we able to create the aggregation measure in the model like below? I tried to create a calculated measure like below but it doesn't work.

Thank you.

In the current configuration, we have managed to make all 6 activities un editable and it will propose planned activity qtys according to the partial confirmation of the order.
Is there a way for us to only block some of the activities and leave the rest of the activities editable to the user.
for example activity 1 - Gas, and activity 2 - electricity, I want to let the user enter these activities according to the actual meter readings. 
Note that not all my work centers have these activities and they are not always activity 1 and activity 2, in some workcenter, gas can be activity 3.
If non available material is present in sales order without rejection status , then material availability (1-03-2023)date during ATP check in ERP while saving is different from after rescheduling the sales order without any changes to 06-03-2023. Why?
Reason for my understanding  CASE 1: While saving SO without rejection status:
If any out of stock material is present in sales order during rescheduling( Document button) system performs backward scheduling, TM proposes logistic (scheduling) dates to ERP and ATP controller fails to confirm the proposed dates due to delay in material availability or (non-availability of material). So now system performs forward scheduling with pickup date provided by ATP as input and get revised dates from TM.
Here MAD during ATP check in ERP is 01-03-2023.CASE2: Rescheduling after saving:System proposes scheduling dated with the same behavior(backward + forward) as in case1 but it calculates with a new material availability date based on stock availability/ material condition at that point of time.(at the time of rescheduling). The variation of material availability date from case1 to case2 is completely based on ATP check in ERP system and not based on TM Scheduling.
Here Material availability during ATP check in ERP is 06-03-2023 but in case 1 is 01-03-2023. My question is why this ATP check MAD is different during forward scheduling in both cases?
Next question is during forward scheduling Requested pickup start date is present in RCCF log inder Input FU stages also different for forward scheduling in both cases.
What is the difference between Material availability dates during ATP check to this Requested pickup start date in RCCF log ? 
How PUDLV ( pick up delivery window conditions) condition comes into picture ln this case? How it affects the requested pickup start date in RCCF log and MAD during ATP check?
We are having trouble bringing up the Outbound Sync (Under Integration UI Tool of backoffice) on 1811 Commerce (Local Build).
We were under the impression that it has to be build on 1811 Commerce Cloud; however, in this webinar (https://enable.cx.sap.com/media/0_c5d5tt8x) at 19:43 we found that a local build version of 1811 Commerce also enable Outbound Sync (see screencap below).
Thus we wonder how this setup can be done? 

Hi, to enable Outbound Sync, you need to include the 'outboundsyncbackoffice' extension in your local extensions.xml. Let us know if you have any questions.

Hello Everyone,
Two sales orders, with different delivery dates, were combined into one delivery document.
Ship-to, shipping point, shipping condition, route, incoterms are all the same.
Please refer to more details below (using 5 work day calendar).
Appreciate your advice how sales orders with different delivery dates, be combined into one delivery document.

Delivery document copy control as follows.

Your feedback is much appreciated.
Best regards,

Hello Haryati binti Jaafar,
First create one delivery for one sale order in VL01N with selection date 01.03.2023 and save the delivery. Again go to VL02N and click on menu Outbound Delivery---->Delivery Sale Order (Refer screenshot) and on next screen enter your second sale order to add in existing delivery.
Please check and confirm.

Hello Neeraj,
Thank you for your feedback.
Hello Everyone,
The expectation is, for two deliveries to be created, as the orders are with different delivery dates.
But only one delivery is created, where it combined both sales orders, with tcode VL10I.
My question: Are delivery dates not checked, when SAP combines the two sales orders into one delivery?
Appreciate the feedback.

Hi,I faced the same issue. OCI extension in OOTB was removed since version 1905.Unfortunately, at the moment there is no replacement and/or migration guide for it. you may need to consider implement similar feature via customization.
Hi,
I created a p-user and an account in sap universal ID. Works fine. Then I tried cf -login. I get a few times the {"error":"invalid_grant","error_description":"User authentication failed: UNAUTHORIZED"} and then the user is locked. {"error":"invalid_grant","error_description":"User authentication failed: PASSWORD_LOCKED"}.
I receive an email that tells me that the user is logged and I can repeat the whole process after 1h when the user is unlocked.
Seems that the password is wrong, allthough it works fine in the SAP Universal ID. Any Ideas how I can get the correct password to login to Canary - the p-user (email) has all necessary permissions in Canary.
Thanks Frank
Hi Frank,
as you are an SAP Employee (with either D- or I-User) but you also mention that you have a P-User I guess they are both connected to the same E-Mail address in SAP Universal ID. But for the cf login actually the "password relevant for legacy SAP applications" is used. I solved such issues by having all "legacy" passwords for the users sharing the same E-Mail in sync. You can do that via https://account.sap.com/manage/accounts in the details of a specific account via "Reset Account Password":

Not sure if that would work also with your SAP D-/I-User password.
Another option when you do an interactive login would be to use:

Dear Experts,
Kindly note that we are currently trying to to config Sap Customer Checkout for several SAP Business One HANA data bases using a single Integration framework (Cloud Control Centre concept) with in the application server . In this situation Can anyone advise how to use the Customer Checkout monitor function to monitor those data bases activities separately and Is there any other way around to fill this requirement accordingly . Thanks in advance .
Best Regards,
Tharindu Wijesinghe.
Hello Tharindu Wijesinghe,
you can use multiple B1i runtime users to separate different customers in B1. These runtimes users are assigned to the specific B1 DB with the system ID, which is set in B1i -> User administration. In CCO you just use the customers runtime user, then they can only connect to their assigned B1 DB for receipt posting & synchronisation.
See also the Solution Cloud in this note: https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2632210
This explains it quite well. 
Best Regards
Kai
Dear Gunther ,
Thanks a lot for your continues support on this query and yes finally succeeded the non cloud test run. Now can view the separate data bases result using different runtime users . Next about to try this with in the cloud control center environment . Thanks again for your assistance as always .
Best Regards,
Tharindu Wijesinghe . 
Hello  Tharindu Wijesinghe 
I am not sure I understand the question here. The integration currently works like this:
Accordingly, there is absolutely no touch point between CCOM and B1IF, so your question as to the implications of using CCC on the B1IF side has no impact at all on the way you implement CCOM.
If you want to know how to set up CCOM for multiple customers, please check the chapter regarding multi-tenancy in the CCOM guide. That way you use a single CCOM installation for multiple customers, each with different databases (or rather, schemas).
More details here: Using SAP Customer Checkout manager in Multi-Tenant Mode
Hope this helps.
Best regards,

Hello Joerg ,
Let me explain about my query further ,
It's like this we are having a cloud space call cloud control center for SAP Business One HANA . So in there we have configured several different customer's data bases (Normal Hana installation has 2 servers one Application and other one data base server but here adding another server called cloud control center it may replace with SLD and having privilege to manager user access separation as per the understanding) . So when need access to those different company data bases IT team providing separate access related only to particular company data bases for our clients . Even though there are several customers on board Cloud control center manage access to the data base separately using the SAP Business one installation in the application server . 
There for it is not several data bases for one customer and different data bases for different customers . We have installed two different sap customer checkout and two different sap customer checkout manager as well for two customers initially to test the scenario using different ports . So my concern is how to separate customer checkout monitor function for those two different customers because both customers are using the same checkoutB1i .

Hope this is understandable and could you kindly guide us on this .
Thanks and Best Regards,
Tharindu .
Hello Kai ,
Thanks for the advise on our above query . We are in the process of checking the same and could you please tell further which license need to be attached to this run time user to pass entries to sap business one.
Because as below we have provided license types to that user but below error coming in the checkout monitor preventing entry to be posted to the sap business one . 


Thanks in advance.

Tharindu Wijesinghe.
Dear  Tharindu Wijesinghe,
Please refer to the help documentation:
For connecting to SAP Business One Cloud, the integration framework for SAP Business One must contain the document com.sap.b1i.vplatform.directory/B1OD/config.xml. In the case of problems, please check whether this file exists under the path specified.
Can you confirm the config.xml exists in the path specified above?
Best regards,
Gunther
Dear Gunther ,
Thanks for supporting on this query ,
The documentation link been provided cannot find in the help portal .
The mention file is not exist with in the said path here is the screen shot below for your reference ,

And please note that before going to continue this process with in Cloud control center we are checking this solution with in on-premise pc to get make sure we can view two different customers data base's sales data separately with in one customer checkout monitor . 
Could you kindly advise any thing we need to try and out on our environment further to get what we required . 
Thanks and Best Regards,
Tharindu .
Dear Tharindu Wijesinghe,
The config.xml file in path /B1iXcellerator/exec/webdav/com.sap.b1i.vplatform.directory/B1OD/ indicates whether it's a cloud system. Since your system is on-premise the config.xml is not there. This is as expected.
But for testing / simulating the cloud scenario you can just add the config.xml file in this directory. It doesn't need any content, it just needs to be there with this exact name.
Step-by-step description:
I just tested it myself - it works.
Best regards,
Gunther
Dear Gunther ,
Above advises are well noted and appreciate your support on this . Kindly note that I followed previously below steps to extend the said path to create the config.xml as you mentioned there again and did the above given steps as well but still it shows all transaction with out any difference no matter the user (Runtime or the B1i) . So we guess our WEBDEV connection was not established as required . There fore could you kindly advise how to do it properly and then we can try the same again accordingly . 
Thanks and Best Regards,
Tharindu .
Dear Gunther ,
Yes that's correct …! 
Kindly find below screen shots as requested ,
B1i Runtime users ---

B1i user login in checkout monitor (POS system CCO comes from SYSID - 0010000101 and TEST comes from SYSID - 0010000102 )

B1i_Runtime_1 login in checkout monitor --


B1i_Runtime_2 login in checkout monitor --


Guess from the below steps 3rd point not been done in our test environment so kindly consider that as well and please advise further how we can do it properly .

Hello friends, my lead has given me 1 scenario. It's a realtime scenario.i need to tell a solution. Plz help me with this if you know. Scenario is like for ex RATL is a company which build highways and part of highway is gonna build by abc,xyz & RATL. But only RATL will procure material from vendor & then it will transfer to ABC & XYZ. But the problem is how we can transfer material from RATL to ABC? How will check stock consumed & remaining at RATL & ABC both level? 
Hello https://people.sap.com/srinivasre,
You haven't described what is ABC and XYZ. I am assuming if these are your plants then you can transfer stock by standard STO process and if these are outside vendors then you can transfer the stock by standard sub contracting process. In both process you can check stock in MB52.
Let me know if any questions on it.

Hi Partha Saradhi K J,
The only way to find out what is really causing the error is to reproduce the error and compare normal http request with the ones when it is failing. 
As a best practice while troubleshooting JavaScript based front-end applications such as the ones you code on SAPUI5 is to take a look at the requests on the 'network' tab. Usually you will look for errors like 401 on the list of http requests and try to make sense of what the app is trying to do versus what is not happening. 
For instance: find the request that resulted in error 401 and look at request query, header variables, cookies, etc. Try to reproduce the same payload the app is producing on the log outside the browser - I prefer using Postman, but you could certainly use other tools like curl to emulate the same payload. 
Maybe you are not getting an error on a batch request, but that request is failing due to invalid credentials due to an expired security token. 
Hope this helps.
Best regards,Ivan

Hi, 
I am using ADT in combination with SAP GUI 8.0 (32 bit) and it's working fine.
Do you use 64bit-version of SAP GUI?
I would propose to create an incident for SAP so that they can check the issue in detail.
Use the menu entry in Eclipse via "Help - Report Incident...". They will ask you in a first step for collective support information from your ADT-installation. This can be generated via menu entry in Eclispe via "Help - Collect Support Information".
I hope this helps you to solve the issue with the support of SAP.
Kind regardsJens
Hi All,
Could you please advise the steps for downloading all the roles and role owners in SAP using the tables and how to filter.
Waiting,
Harini
Hello Harini konidela,
Please check tables GRACROLE and GRACROLEAPPRVR.
Confirm if it's works for you.

Neeraj Jain
I need to assign a default field to custom license field via GRC request. Is it possible through configuration only?
I am in the process of creating a registration screen in CDC. This registration should work without entering a password, because the created users should be guest accounts (but should be created as full accounts and NOT as lite accounts). Social Login can not be used.
Currently I get the error message "Missing required parameter" with the error code 403007 when creating the account. I assume that the screen with Behavior = Registration requires a password entry. How do I make it so that this password entry is not required, so that the user is created as Full Account without password? These users should log in later by code without password.
Hi Agit Basibüyük,
The full account process will by default include the password registration and you can't even disable it in configuration. I recommend to use lite account only for your purpose and use progressive profiling.
Hope this was helpful. Thank you.

Hello Agit,
I had the same issue before, but when i was registering customers through the REST endpoint (register/setAccountInfo). What we did was generate a random UID as the password, this makes CDC happy and the customer doesn't get affected.
So i believe that you can do the same thing, using the java script in the screensets. Then use CSS to simple hide the password box OR remove it all in all from your screen.
Hi,
Is there a standard S/4HANA report that shows breaks down of material standard costs by material cost, machine, labor, overheads etc. 
Thank you.
Ashraf
Hi Ashraf,
It's standard function for material cost estimate.
You can check the cost componets view in the standard cost estimate.
Best Regards,Owen
Thanks for your reply Owen, but I need a list of all items with cost break down, not single part at a time.
Thanks

Hello Experts, 
I have a question pertaining to improving a report I created. Thanks in advance for your time!
What I would like is to have the sum of my PO line items automatically display underneath the PO they are referencing without rolling the PO/PO lines into a hierarchy. The report is intended to be "no-touch" and a scheduled publication distributed weekly via emailed PDF. As such, I do not want to have to unroll it every week, as that would defeat the purpose of where I currently am (which is summing the lines individually, and also not ideal). 
A sample of my current version is below. The white boxes are covering sensitive information about the suppliers and pricing. 

What is the easiest way to have my sums populate automatically? I thought maybe I could use LOOKUP, which appears to work in execution, but is aesthetically unpleasing due to the repeating values. 

On second thought.... Is there a way to limit the repetitive structure (ex: PO 4500022629 shows 8872.48 only once in the Per PO calculation column)? A set-up like that would also suffice, although I'd prefer a horizontal orientation for the calculated sum. That being said, beggars can't be choosers!
Thanks again for reading and much appreciation for any assistance! 
Welp, here is how you answer your own question. 
So, the power of right-click never ceases to amaze me. For any other newbies that stumble upon this, add the itemized field back in as a displayed dimension in your report, and then right click on the column/row header. Do NOT click on an individual value, as you will receive different options. 

After that, you can change the orientation (top/bottom) in the builder. 

the last column is pressable. The event should be executed upon the metadata of the row. So when i click "print", i need to print only the data of one selected row.
oTable.getSelectedIndex(); is not working and oEvent.getSource() has no data.

Hi Abhishek,
Usage of COMMIT WORK / ROLLBACK WORK statements will cause the runtime error as RAP framework only manages it and also the update task or background task can be called in the late-save phase only. 
Ideally it would be better to validate in check before save and then call the update task FM in the save method of the RAP handler class in case of unmanaged RAP BO and also in case of Managed implementation with unmanaged save.
Please go through the below blogs for more details.
https://blogs.sap.com/2022/11/30/using-bapis-in-rap/
https://blogs.sap.com/2022/12/05/the-sap-luw-in-abap-cloud/#_ftn4
Thanks,
Pavan
RAP framework doesn't allow external COMMIT WORK. So you are getting the runtime error.
You are also writing the LOG using the FM which also use the COMMIT WORK.
For this kind of requirement where you need to use standard API. Create a wrapper RFC FM with the runtime data and call on background task so that another LUW will be started. ( This should be done in the save method ) in the implementation.
You can do whatever you want in that function module.
You can go for enabling the notification service which can be linked to the application log you are updating.
This will be a asynchronous solution. So once transaction is completed, the notification should be populated.
Notification service Link.
Thanks
Sagar Prusty
Hi Abishek,  
you should try to use the new released API's that are available to handle the application log.
Classes and Interfaces of the Application Log API | SAP Help Portal
These are also released to be used in ABAP for Cloud Development in SAP BTP, ABAP Environment and SAP S/4HANA, ABAP Environment. 
I have used this in my class that shows how to schedule an application job from within RAP. There the application job is configured to use a certain application log object.

Hi,When selecting key LINA "Depreciation key LINA is not defined in chart of depreciation IFRS"What is the reason. 
Thanks------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
The depreciation key is not delivered with Accounts Principle IFRS, the error is correctly thrown in your situation. This is described in the below KBA.
3068338    AC 520 - Depreciation key  is not defined in chart of depreciation  creating an asset
Please note it is not possible for Support to create new keys for Accounts Principles, this is detailed in the SAP Help Guide. If you require a new depreciation key, you will need to submit a feature request, please see the attached notes which detail how to start the request, please note the Support Channels have no role in this process, a feature request is the only possibility to reach the responsible teams. 
Hi,

I'm trying to get Hire date of an employee with two records with date type '01' in different dates. But when I try to call FM with selection end date inside period of the first record it's returning the last date.
Anyone can help me how does it works exactly?

Which customizing is necessary?

Thanks
you can use this function module; 
RP_GET_HIRE_DATE
exporting
CHECK_INFOTYPES = '0041' 
.

How do I obtain powerpoint documens for SAP Activate for Private cloud to present to a cusomter?
Hi Bill, 
All Activate content for Private Cloud can be found in the Roadmap Viewer here: SAP Activate Methodology for RISE with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition.
Hope this helps,
Nicole 
Go to SAP Activate Roadmap viewer, select the relevant roadmap for your project. Select the accelerators Tab. Here you will distinguish some but not all power point presentations bi looking the extension. i.e. Cloud Mindset Assessment_External.pptx
Unfortunately there are other presentations in powerpoint you will need to discover opening the accelerator itself.
hi all,
 am not able to get the hire date of the employee using the below mentioned FM. can any one ensure that what am doing is correct. am passing pernr and action infotype. 

CALL FUNCTION 'RP_GET_HIRE_DATE'
 EXPORTING
 PERSNR = i_out-pernr
 CHECK_INFOTYPES = '0000'

 DATUMSART = '01'
 STATUS2 = '3'
 P0016_OPTIONEN = ' '
IMPORTING

 HIREDATE = i_out-hidat
 .


Thanks
Senthil bala
Hi ,

This is the example taken from this forum.

*Get the joining date of the employees
CALL FUNCTION 'RP_GET_HIRE_DATE'
EXPORTING
persnr = it_overseas-empno
check_infotypes = '0000'
IMPORTING
hiredate = it_overseas-doj.

If you search the forum by giving the name of the function module in Forum search , you will get one more HR related qn. other than yours.
In that, they are using this fn. module .

Regards,
J.Jayanthi
Why cannot be used the function module HRENTRYDATE? (Sorry, for generic name, don't remember the exact name).
I am trying to download the CR for Visual Studio Runtime as well as a copy of Crystal Reports 2020, which we licensed through the SAP Store. Every time I click a download link (either by registering for a trial, or the Crystal download site), I get the below error. 
Because it was a single license purchased through the SAP store, I don't have an S account and can't request support from anywhere. 
You are not authorized to download this filePlease make sure that your company has purchased this software product. If you have a valid license, but still cannot download this file, please report an incident under component XX-SER-SAPSMP-SWC.
hi   Vivek Sharma 
 why don't you chat with CIC here
no my best solution but better than nothing :)
cheers!A
Thanks for the suggestion. Tried that earlier - was a hopeless conversation. Basically redirected me to posting on here, or to open a support ticket. Only downside is we purchased this as a single license from the SAP Store, so we don't have an S-account (and can't open tickets). 
By the looks of it, seems like an issue with the SAP download links. Because even creating a new SAP account and requesting a trial download results in the same error message. Hopefully they pick up on that soon and come up with a fix. Because otherwise, I'm not sure how to open a ticket or get the message out. 
I am looking at adding / implementing get right flags in our SAP system. I would like a pop up box to display where the representative has to check off the boxes for our contract review process. What is the process / own data code for adding this?
Boa tarde, 
Trabalho em uma empresa onde fazemos o corte de bobinas de aço que geram perdas por sobra de material e ponta de bobina. Tais perdas são esperadas e atualmente não possúimos forma de apontamento para tais.
As opções que tenho são:
1º Baixa por sucata - feita no centro de custo prejudica a área a qual está processando o material.
2º Baixa por inventário - Tambem baixada posteriormente no centro de custo prejudicando a área.
Minha duvida é: Como as perdas são esperadas, há alguma forma de realizar o apontamento de tais diretamente em um lote de produção? Ex: diluir a sobra de 1.000kg de aço em um lote de 10.000 veículos produzidos.
Caso seja possível, qual seria a forma de apontamento e transação adequada para tal baixa?
Can any body tell me how to solve this?

IT use to work before upgrading to Windows 11
I'm kind of desperate
Thanks you in advance
It appears you are using the .NET SDK which you can get from here:
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/Crystal+Reports%2C+Developer+for+Visual+Studio+Downloads
The latest version supports Windows 11, older version do not.
If you wrote the application you or the Developer will need to upgrade the application to SP 33 to be supported on Windows 11.
If you didn't write the app then you need to contact the makers and ask them to upgrade to SP 33 to be supported on Windows 11.
Are you asking to install a version not supported on Windows 11?
What SP are you using before Windows 11 upgrade?
I guess the alternative is to go back to Windows 10 or ask Microsoft to change Windows 11 so it appears to be Windows 10 along with rolling back all of the Windows 11 features....
And note Windows 11 does not include Paint by default, it's required to be installed:
Hello,
We have 2020 S4 Hana/EWM, with QM, the GR creates 04 and 17 inspection lot, but if we cancel GR, only 04 inspection lot is cancelled and not the 17.( as of now we are cancelling it manually)
Is there a way, which can cancel the inspection lot 17 in EWM when GR is reversed.
Hi everybody,
we have successfully completed the ACACACT process. but we cannot see the accounting documents on the FBL3N screen. Do we need to do the "ACACTRANSFER" operation as well ?
i hope that has been revealing
thank you,
murat ozturkYes, you will need to perform the ACACTRANSFER operation in order to view the accounting documents on the FBL3N screen. This operation will transfer the accounting documents from the ACACACT process to the FBL3N screen.

Dear community,
I need to manage the customer factoring process in S/4HANA Public Cloud.
Description of the process :
Customers might be defined as "factored" (could be a status in the customer master data + the factoring company code). For each customer defined as "factored", daily or on demand, the system must transfer its invoices to a factoring company. That means that the invoices are paid by the factor company (minus an interest %). The risk is then transfered to the factoring company. 
Following transactions must be posted for the transfer :
Customer credit for the invoice amount. Interest GL account and Factoring account (both on debit). The factoring account works like a bank account.
The description above is an example
I did not find any scope item covering this feature, is there any workaround or bespoke stuf (in BTP ?) or any customer experience ?
Many thanks for support
PAscal
Hi Pascal,
I am not aware of a scope item that would cover this
However, it sounds like a perfect scenario that could be covered by InApp and Side-by-Side extensibility.
For the InApp, you could define a custom field for the Customer and enable it for some of the various APIs in the Custom Fields app

This would allow you to classify the customer as Factored or Not.
For the Side-by-Side, this basically means an externally developed application that interacts with S/4HANA Cloud via the Public APIs (S/4HANA Cloud API Hub). You could have this app developed in BTP and designed to run hourly/daily, etc.
I would expect the app would, via ODATA API calls
You will need to do some design to iron out the details so that the billing docs are properly dispositioned and proper journals are updated, but seems most of the pieces are there.
I hope this helps
Thank you

Hey, 
I want to create a report in SuccessFactors Report Center like the following one but I am not sure if it is possible. 
Does anyone know how can I create a report like that in SF? 

Hi ,
I tried to use table replicator with source as mssql and target as adl but I got the error saying create table access is not present . So how should I proceed now . Also suggest me if there are any other operators which will bring delta changes from MSSQL .
Thanks
Devang
Devang Sharma
Table replicator is designed to replicate data between two tables with the same structure. In order to use it to replicate data from an MSSQL table to an ADL table, you will need to ensure that the two tables have the same structure.

Additionally, if the source MSSQL table is not already present in the target ADL table, then you will need to provide CREATE TABLE access to the target table in order to create the table in ADL.

If you need to replicate data from MSSQL to ADL, you may want to consider using Azure Data Factory's copy activity. This allows you to copy data from an MSSQL source to an ADL sink. You can also set up a pipeline to monitor for changes in the source table and then trigger the copy activity to replicate the delta changes to the target table.
It sounds like the "create table" permission might not be given to the user defined in the target connection. Review the permissions required for the user in the operator help docs:
The following source-specific SQL Privileges are required. Ensure that the connection user has the following privileges:

Please be aware that the tag 'SAP Replication Server' refers to another SAP product.

Dear SAP,
We would like to know how to change the Company logo on Theme Designer, kindly support us.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
Hello,
Kindly follow the guides below:
For Urgent change "Import into Production" can be executed Via Status change i.e., from "Authorized to Production" to "Import into Production", In the backend TR Import gets triggered and TR gets imported in production and then the status gets changes these based on consistency actions such as Import_Prod.However for a Normal change it is executed via Task List. We want to enable Import similar to urgent change i.e. just by changing the status from "Released from Import" to "Imported to Production".We enabled Preliminary Import, That serves the purpose but we need to go through so many actions with this functionality.
How can we enable individual Normal changes Import Via Just status change?------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
Instead of using preliminary import statuses, you can assign the preliminary import actions to other statuses. 
PRM_NEXT_IMP > for import into Quality system 
PRM_PRD_IMP > for import into PROD 
The following documentation can help you to better understand the preliminary import actions and perform your changes https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_Solution_Manager/8b923a2175be4939816f0981b73856c7/6dd161ef346f45b98c040e40d9810416.html?locale=en-US
Hi experts. I am new to this program and having trouble with formula. I want to count each unique ID by year and if the year equals the current year then multiply that by 2.
I created a count variable and was trying do do something like this but I cannot get it to work. Any help is appreciated.
=if(year([Date])=Year(CurrentDate() Then [COUNT]*12) Else [COUNT]
End result should be:
2019 = 5
2020 = 5
2021 = 1
2022 = 2
2023 = 2

define the following variables:
v_Year:   =Year([Date])
v_COUNT:   =Count([Uniqueid]) ForEach([v_Year])
V_Final_Count:   =If ([v_Year] = Year(CurrentDate())) Then [v_COUNT]*2 Else [v_COUNT]

try with below variable
=if(year([Date])=Year(CurrentDate() in ([Color])) Then [COUNT]*12 Else [COUNT]

I have a requirement assigned to trigger outbound idoc after delivery PGI is completed. Once the delivery PGI is done, the outbound idoc triggers as expected. The problem now is when I go to vl02n again for same delivery and hit save without changing anything, the outbound idoc triggers again.
This is only happening in the ECC system and the same functionality is working fine in S4
How can i restrict the outbound idoc if there is no change after PGI.

Hi
When I do Role Level Simulation and choose Detail format I often get orange lines with word "Valid" in the Short Description field. It does not make any difference if the box "Risk from Simulation only" is checked or not. 
May I know what such orange lines mean in simulation?
I must say that I am interested in the risks from simulation only and not the risks already existing in the role. 
Thanks
Reza Ahoui




Hi Reza, you have probably executed your simulation using the Technical View as the standard output. You may try to run it using Business View and you will see the Descriptions will properly show up in the result.
Hi Josiane
Thanks for your repsonse
It is already Business View which this orange stuff comes with Description as Valid. However, this makes no difference with Technical view, still same!
Thanks
Hi Reza,
if you are still looking for an answer, there is a document called "GRC Reporting Job Aid 13.docx" from MITJust google it and right-click on the result to save the link (directly clicking on the result didn't work for me)This document refers to the User Level Simulation, but I assume the documentation to be also applicable to toe Role Level Simulation.Just to make you aware, I got a warning that the file might not be safe. 
This document however states, that the orange line items indicate the lines that result from your simulation criteria.As I understand it, SAP uses the highlighting to indicate line items which result solely from the roles you added for the simulation.If you run the simulation for any other role, but add the same roles for simulation, I'd expect the orange lines to be exactly the same. The non-highlighted lines might differ, though.As said, that's just my understanding, but I hope it helps.
Thanks Carl, much appreciated.

How to scope dimensions based on attribute of another dimension in data actions ? 
I have Product Dimension which has Material and Cost center as attributes. I need to scope Material and Cost center dimensions with Product dimension attributes. 
Tried with below code but it is not working when Material is referenced with Product dimension.
Same code is working fine when material value is hardcoded. 
MEMBERSET [d/SP_P_PRODUCT] = %Product%
MEMBERSET [d/SP_Material]=[d/SP_P_PRODUCT].[p/MATERIAL]
DATA([d/Measures] = "ZBOM_BAS_QTY") = RESULTLOOKUP([d/Measures] = "BOMQTY", [d/Account_SP] = "BOM_QTY", [d/SP_PROD_DIM] = "BOMQTY")
I get the error "Condition was not met " when executed the code in debug mode.
Please help on this?
Lakshmi M
If the % Product% parameter is of type leaf and with a hierarchy defined (see below) The Scoping syntax looks fine. See an example below. Please check if you have the right data intersection. The issue can be there is nothing getting returned based on your RESULTLOOKUP(). Also the issue can be the other dimensions getting passed from scope to DATA() and the ones coming from RESULTLOOKUP() for same dimensions. You can create a variable member for Measure and put a code block like below and then diagnose the lookup section of your formula trace. That will give you some help.
Something like below. 

Worked out a similar example for you.
Sales Org parameter.

I have an Entity attribute defined in Sales Org.

I will try to copy the data for these 2 sales org from Actual to Budget
Please Note: MEMBERSET [d/SAP_CEP_ENTITY]=[d/SAP_CEP_SALESORG].[p/ENTITY] This is only helpful if you also have data against the sales org with Entity combinations which are not part of the attributes of sales org. Refer to Trace section below for details.
Output: As Expected

Insights from Formula Trace:

Sales Org parameter correctly picks up 2 selected values and the same is used as scope

Entity is scoped to 6 members and not only 2 . These are all possible values from attribute Entity from Sales org dimension and not only ENT0001 and ENT0002 (Entity attributes of passed sales org values)
Hope this helps !!
Nikhil
Nikhil AnandAnand, Thank you for the detailed explanation.
Let me put it in this way. 
Product dimension has attribute called Product and the value is same as Product ID.
For ex:
Prod ID Product
P001 P001
Material dimension has attribute called Product and value is same as Product ID.
Material ID Product
M001 P001
M002 P001
M003 P001
How to scope Material dimension in case of above scenario? 
Hi Experts, 
I'm new to Asset Manager and have been going through SAP Asset Manager configuration guide document. But could not understand much about the configuration. 
Can please anyone suggest me how and from where to start learning configuration of AM and how its different from IMG configuration.

Thank you, 
Hi, 
Beyond the config guide, you can review the SAP Blogs on SAP Service and Asset Manager ( formally SAP Asset Manager). 
Additionally the SAP Learning course and material would be of value: IAM150 
In general, the config and user guides are good starting points. i would recommend to focus first on the common config proceedures and filters:

also key to understand is the Distribution rules/ Assignment types as this is the foundation for the application sync logic.

Do we have value quantifed for integration between S/4 and other solutions could be like EWM, IBP, SCSF, ARIBA, etc. ? 
This is number one question from our customers but I can't find any content that clearly shows the value of integration. 
Hello Carroll,
you may check out the ASUG & SAP survey about the state of integration among SAP customers which describes the benefits of integration: ASUG Survey - The State of Integration Among SAP Customers
Best regards,
Katrin 
Hi Katrin,
Thanks for the response; however, I don't see any quantified value in this ASUG document. I would like to see, saved 20% on implementation time, maintenance overtime for integration between EWM and S/4 is 30% lower, integration across systems enables process 1,2,3 to flow automatically saving one headcount per 1,000 sales orders. 
Does that make sense?

Hello everyone,I have a task to create custom report that will list the documents from VBRK table. In selection screen I have several parameters. Now I need to add one more parameter that should filter the search by a data that is on the Account assignment car of the sales order for that document. However, that data is in COBL-AUFNR field. Since COBL is not a table, I cant get the data from it. Do you have any suggestions on how can I get the COBL-AUFNR data for any of the documents. The main question: In other words how to find out what actual table (THAT I CAN LINK/JOIN TO VBRK/VBRP TABLES) contains that data.I may not be clear so here's an example: 
I have a sales order with Order ID: 3809

In every line item in card Account assignment there is a field labeled "Order": PS3938 (when I go F1 I see that's the COBL-AUFNR field) 

There is a document with ID number 90007876 that I can connect to Sales document 3809 since there is a column that contains that data.

I now need to put a parameter in selection screen where someone will enter "PS3938" and get 90007876 document (along with all the other documents that in their sales order have PS3938 in any of the lines of the sales order) listed in the report. That's why I need to find what actual table contains that data, and I have to be able to connect that table with VBRK or VBRP tables. Hopefully I was clear enough and there is a good soul that will help me find the solution. Best regards to all!
Hello Bojan Ivanovic,
The AUFNR field already placed in VBAP table and you can get order# itself from VBAP table and build your logic.

Hello all, 
Is it possible to customize the Learning History tile field to include item revision?
Currently it only shows Completion date, Title and Status and you need to hover on the Title and click View Details to check the revision number. 
Thanks! 
Hi Gwen,
there are no configuration options for the learning history tile available. As you correctly state the only way to view the item revision is by navigating to "View Details" page and verify the revision number and date.
A possible workaround could be to use the learning history report, the report includes by standard the item ID including revision number and date.

Service Plans and Quota assignment for SAP BTP IAS. Need help with Service plans and assigned quota. SAP Documentation does not provide concrete information.
I have referred to Online Help for BTP and IAS. The information given for Service Plans, Quota assignments etc. is not complete. 
Please find attached 2 screenshots for which I am looking for more information.
1. Service Plans like Standard, Lite, Custom, Default etc. What is the difference between them and how do they differ in cost? Then in Subaccount, the Service Plans are Application, Default etc. 
2. Quota assignment like 1 shareable unit. Is that 1 unit shared between multiple Subaccounts?
For example, I see 1 Cloud Identity Services which has 1 shareable unit. Does it mean I can use IAS with one subaccount?
Then there is Quota assignment which is Limited. Could not find information for this too. Just one liner or 2 somewhere.

job-variant.pngjob-variant2.pngfiscal-period.pngDear Experts,
We have production order settlement job that runs every day which picks up any production order that has been tecoed the previous day. The issue occurs when the job settles the orders the day after the fiscal month end date the account posting date is reflected in the next months final day for example if the month end date is 19th feb and order is tecoed on 19th feb when the job runs on 20th feb the account posting date is coming on next months period end i.e 27th of March.
This is causing issues when doing reconciliation since posting date and order completion are on different months.
And note that this is happening for some months.
so please let me know if the system behaviour is standard or if there is something that needs to be changed in the job variant. 
settlement.png 
Hi Pradeep,
Just thinking out loud, why cannot you setup a posting date as a variable for today's date in the variant for the job?
It is a standard behavior for the settlement program to use the last date of the period as default posting date, unless you specify otherwise.

Hi Gurus,
I don't see SAP ASE Edge edition listed in the price list anymore, only ASP is available. Did SAP remove edge edition? Is there any official announcement? 
This web page:
https://www.sybase-influential.com/sap-ase-edge/
says,
"Sold exclusively through SAP partners like Influential, SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise, Edge Edition provides the same benefits as the ASE Enterprise version with just a few select limitations and restrictions"
The best technical discussion of ASE Edge (that I found) is at:
https://www.doblerconsulting.com/sap-showcase/sap-ase-edge-edition/
Basically, you're still limited to 8 cores, but connections aren't limited to 255 (which is great!). Somehow, this makes the Edge license more cloud friendly. 
As far as I can tell, there are no prices posted online for Edge. You have to call a SAP partner to get a price, which in my organization means it has to go through management & purchasing to make the price inquiry, which means it won't happen.

We heard from a sales rep that SAP will support old Edge Edition licenses, but they're no longer selling new ones.

Hi Professionals,

I like to clarify if the following is correct:

1. Sales Area Must Be assigned to Sales document type.

regards
John
Hi,

No need to assign the sales document types to sales areas if you want to keep all the document types are eligible for all sales areas.

If you start to assign the sales document types to sales areas; then you have to assign all the respective sales document types to the concerned sales areas.

Regards,
K Bharathi
For these sort of question, better try creating a sale order by not assigning the sales area to that sale order type.  You will get the answer.  Please try to avoid posting such question for which you yourself can easily find the answer.

thanks
G. Lakshmipathi
Hello John,

Sales Area is the set-up that combines sales organisation, distributional channel and division

 By setting up Sales Area: You can define materials belonging to which divisions can be sold thorough specific Distribution Channels such as Whole-sale or Retail.

You can control specific transactions based on allowed document types.

So the assignment is necessary to sales organisation, which will control the sales documnet type.

Br,
Tushar
Hi

By assigning the Sales Documents to Sales area you can control the various do types which can be used for that sales area.

And it is a must in order to create any sales docs.

regards
Prashanth
YES. that statement is CORRECT.

Rgds

Sumanth.G
hi

my BOSS lakshmi pathi sir is right

adding some points to John

yes your are right 

you will assign in SPRO to restrict other sales areas not to work with the sales document type.

you will assign the same n pricing procedure determination as well for getting the correct pricing procedure in the sales document

hope this clears your sise

balajia
Hi John,


1. Sales Area Must Be assigned to Sales document type

-as far as the logic for this goes ,
its main relevanmce is to limit the sales document type to the sales area is that the end user does not create a sales order ,
for another sales area in your sales document let for ex-

there is a sales area for whole sales and one for retail.
now you have configurerd the ywho sales doc type for whole sales- sales area and yret for retail sales area.

now if the user creates the ywho sales order in retail sales area there will be process related problems for despatch guys so in order to limit this error and hassle, there are the ales area specific sales document types and can be configured as earlier told by gurus

revert if helpful
Mohit Singh
Hi
The sales document type should be assigned to the sales area to activate the document type to that particular Sales area in SAP and these are basic-level questions.

what are settings need to be configured in the sales document type?
We are using FIORI Import and Export bank accounts. We export from a good system in XML template and import in a target system. While uploading in the target system, the ID Category of the connectivity path defaults to 00 (Central system: GL account). We need this to be 01 (Central system: House bank Account). We are not able to find a config path to default this. Can anybody help?
Thank you.
Hello everyone,
during an integration test we noticed that Strategy Group 10 (make-to-stock production) seems to be related to requirements type "KSL". However, these requirements are not taken into consideration in an MRP run. Only when I manually set the requirements type in the sales order or in the delivery schedule from KSL to 041, the transfer of requirements works as usual. I cannot find any Customizing for this and I have no insight into the corresponding tables. How can this be solved?
Thank you! 
Dear Katja, 

you question is more related to manufacturing. 

Strategy Group 10 is for planning with Planned independent requirements. It does not take sales order requirements into consideration. So it is purely Make-to-stock production. 

Please set strategy group to 40 in Material Master, this takes PIRs and Sales Orders into consideration. Please be advised, that a change of strategy group is not applied to existing sales order. 

Best regards,
Daniel 
I am having serious issues installing Crystal Reports Runtime Engine for .NET Framework (64-bit) on Windows 11 ARM Virtual Machine running on my MacBook Pro M1 Pro. The installation of the 32-bits versions went very smoothly without any issues, but when installing the 64-bit version, I run into the following error; 
1. Error 1304. Error writing to file: log4net.dll
After clicking Retry I get the following error;
2. Error 2350. FDI Server Error
After clicking Retry again I get the following error;
3. Error 1334. The file log4net.dll.686C6F6F.2892.4BC4.ADF0.8134ABC43516 cannot be installed because the file cannot be found in the cabinet file 'zzz.cab'.

Hiya, 
I've been scouring the API documentation trying to see if this is achievable with no success so far, so hoping someone has a solution/ the documentation. 
I am trying to implement within SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone a number of transactional UI cards that allow an employee to submit data changes such as a change in working hours directly into SF. 
However, imagine there are some business rules on that sort of submission related to specific dates that we don't allow people to submit a change in working hours. 
Sure, the upsert request fails with an error but the requirement is to stop people from even submitting by getting the business rules on the front-end and limiting the date picker / warning them before submission.
Is there any way to grab these rules from SF? Or am I stuck with dual maintenance.
Many thanks, 
Nathan Hand
Buen día expertos!

Deseándoles a todos un feliz año nuevo, les comento la siguiente inquietud agradeciendo de antemano el apoyo.

Esta pasando con la persona encargada de imprimir los cheques para el pago, que ya no le esta apareciendo la ventana de confirmación que te dice que folio sigue y te confirma de impreso el cheque en cuestión.
Es decir, solamente imprime el cheque y ya, tenemos que volver a abrir el cheque para el pago, para ver el folio asignó (afortunadamente hasta ahora el consecutivo corre sin problemas).

Espero haberme explicado bien, y agradezco cualquier idea para solucionarlo.

Saludos!!!!
Si estas leyendo esto y tienes el mismo problema, ya encontré la solución.

En el modulo de Gestión de Bancos > Pagos efectuados > Cheques para el pago

En la ventana de Cheques para el pago, a un lado del botón de cancelar hay un check que dice "Imprimir en papel en blanco", ese debe de estar deshabilitado para que aparezca la ventana de confirmación de cheque.

Hello all,

I read some blogs and questions I could found on this subject, but I with no success on fixing my issue.
I could create successful automation cases using SAP GUI, UI5, Web, Excel, etc. Now I am facing difficulties with SAP WEB GUI screen, I’ve tried to solve my issue in several ways without success. I would like to share my problem to see if somebody had a similar issue and how it was resolved. Any ideas are very welcome.
I’ve added all needed dependencies to my project. Then I am doing the following steps: 1) Create a new application. 



1) 2) Found my desired screen, it shows as IFrame. Selected that and click on Next.

3) I want to do a manual capture and declare elements. I also tried to record that, but the record was not able to capture anything. I also want to mention that only Web technology is available.

4) The screen was captured successfully. I clicked on Go to Application.

5) It comes with Framework = WEB. With WEB it does not work.

a. I changed to SAPWebGui

1) 

 b. It does not let me to declare elements, it shows in red like below.

Just an observation: I also tried using Framework = SAPUI5. In this case I was able to declare the fields, however when testing it, nothing happens in my screen. It is like the system does not recognizes the fields.
Thanks.

Hello guys, I have a client who a business cases with regards to factoring (selling the customer debt). Does anybody know is there an Add-On or functionality (may be Scope Items) in the Cloud for this business case? BR

when i create vendor in sap s4 hana mm through BP transction, after creating BP no, then transfer to FLVNOO then vendor no. not show , while no. range is internal
Hello Prashant,
Do you have any other information like error message or something?
If the number range is set to "Internal" and the vendor number is not being assigned, it could be due to a few different reasons:
Incorrect number range assignment: Check if the number range for vendor creation is correctly assigned in the customizing settings
Incomplete vendor data: Make sure that all required fields in the vendor master data are filled in. Some fields, such as the vendor account group, are required for the number range to be assigned.
Number range maintenance: Ensure that the number range is maintained and active. You can check the status of the number range in the customizing settings
It would be very beneficial if you tell us how you create BP step by step. 
Pls kindly use below tutorial: How to create a BP – Business partner & How to Create a Business Partner in SAP S/4HANA.

I don't know how to call the first screen again, since I didn't actually created it.
Thank you very much in advance.
Hi,

The following statement should help you to return to the selection screen of the transaction which was used to start the transaction.

LEAVE TO CURRENT TRANSACTION.

Hello everyone,
Whenever I send an email from the BODS using SMTP function, some default messages will be printed before printing the actual body of the email. Default message is as shown below.
Mail from: </job name> sent at: < date time >  Message:=======
< email body >



Please suggest if there is any way to remove these default messages.
Thanks in advance.
Greetings Vijay Shankar,
Based on the above description, i assume you are using smtp_to() function to send the emails. This function will use the smtp_mailer.exe email client which unfortunately does not offer much customization. 
You however do have the choice of using other mailing clients if you wish to have more customization options.
Best Regards,
Joseph
Hi Vijay,
You can use powershell script by calling it in Data Services instead of using SMTP function. Powershell script won't print the default message in email body.
Thanks,
Vijay
Hi everybody,
currently, the middleware 'fiori-tools-proxy' of @sap/ux-ui5-tooling cannot be used behind an enterprise proxy if the backend is located in the enterprise network and the npm proxy config (HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY) is set.
The error is located in the "isHostExcludedFromProxy" function. Here it is checked whether the coporate proxy is necessary for the URL set in UI5.yaml. 

In line 107906 a JavaScript URL instance is created from the passed string url (e.g. "https://www.sap.com:443") After that the property "host" is selected from the created instance. However, the host from the URL object is set with port. 
So the endsWith() check in line 107908 is always performed against HOST:PORT. Usually the NO_PROXY environment variable is not set with port, but only the domain is specified. As a result, the function returns 'false' and the proxy is wrongly set for the internal URL.
Workaround, so that it works anyway:
1. Delete environment variable (HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY). NPM with default registry will not work anymore.
2. Add NO_PROXY entry with PORT (*.sap.com:443)

I have two Crystal Reports (.rpt) files on a network drive. I would like to upload these files to my Google Drive and use Google Drive for Desktop to access/open these files. When I open the G: drive (created by Google Drive for Desktop) and try to open one of the Crystal Reports files, I get the following message titled "Crystal Decisions":
"The Microsoft Layer for Unicode (unicows.dll) can not be found. This program will now exit."
If I copy the Crystal Reports files to the network drive, I can open them without issue. Anyone have any advice for storing Crystal Reports files on Google Drive and opening them using Google Drive for Desktop?
Isaac Blasiman
The Microsoft Layer for Unicode (unicows.dll) is a system file that is necessary for certain programs to run correctly on Windows operating systems. Unfortunately, if this file is missing or corrupted, the program will not run and will display the error message you mentioned. In order to fix this issue, you need to reinstall the unicows.dll file on your computer. You can download the file from Microsoft's website and install it on your computer. After that, the program should run correctly again.

Hi, 
We have requirement to update partner city in contract ( VA42 ) using BAPI_CUSTOMERCONTRACT_CHANGE. It is working as expected but remaining address fields except city are updating with blank including email address. 
Can you please suggest a solution? how we can update only city without touching the remaining fields.
Sample code: 
 APPEND VALUE #( DOCUMENT = LS_DATA-VBELN ITM_NUMBER = LS_DATA-POSNR UPDATEFLAG = LC_U PARTN_ROLE = LS_DATA-PARVW P_NUMB_OLD = LS_DATA-KUNNR P_NUMB_NEW = LS_DATA-KUNNR ADDR_LINK = LS_DATA-ADRNR ADDRESS = LS_DATA-ADRNR ) TO LT_PARTNERCHANGES.

 APPEND VALUE #( ADDR_NO = LS_DATA-ADDRNUMBER CITY = LS_DATA-CITY1 ) TO LT_PARTNERADDRESSES.

 LS_CONTRACT_HEADER_INX-UPDATEFLAG = LC_U. " Call BAPI for Contract change. CALL FUNCTION 'BAPI_CUSTOMERCONTRACT_CHANGE' EXPORTING SALESDOCUMENT = LS_DATA-VBELN CONTRACT_HEADER_IN = LS_CONTRACT_HEADER_IN CONTRACT_HEADER_INX = LS_CONTRACT_HEADER_INX* LOGIC_SWITCH = LV_LOGIC_SWITCH SIMULATION = P_TEST TABLES RETURN = LT_RETURN PARTNERCHANGES = LT_PARTNERCHANGES PARTNERADDRESSES = LT_PARTNERADDRESSES.
Thanks in advance,

Seems you must first fill PARTNERADDRESSES with current values of address (check ADDR_CONVERT_TO_BAPIADDR1 or BAPISDORDER_GETDETAILEDLIST?)

Hello experts,
I'm facing an issue with ListPicker control of SAP MDK 6.3.5 when it runs on Android.
The problem is that the ListPicker doesn't provide any bound OData data. Use Case: Items from OData EntitySet are bound as target to ListPicker and the ListPicker provides a list of them. When selected i would like to get all the data (some more properties) behind that entity to prefill other ListPicker controls on the same page.
The MDK ListPicker reference states that this should be possible via TargetPath ending on #SelectedTarget (or on #SelectedRow for at least the index of the selected item in list) but this doesn't work for me. Also binding property is undefined for the ListPicker control.
Here you can see part of the page with corresponding ListPicker:

In the OnValueChange handler i then cant use something like:
pageProxy.evaluateTargetPath("#Page:-Current/#Control:VehicleListPicker/#SelectedTarget");
I debugged this thoroughly but no chance of getting the vehicle item's data in that case.
I mean this should work like that right? Or do you see any issue here?
I can work around this issue with OData ActionResult but it would be way more convenient to use it as stated in API reference.
Please help. :-)
Best Regards,
René
I have not used those target paths you mention before myself.  I will have to look into them.
Today the best option is probably to do an odata read to grab the full data of the selected item. We do also have a backlog item to better expose that as part of the return value but I don't have a timeline on when that will be added.
I would suggest checking (and logging if not there) the influence site for this request as well to help prioritize it.
I'm trying to import a csv file into SAC Trial version, but it send the following error:
The job failed due to an unexpected internal server error. Please contact your system administrator. 
Correlation ID: 28718626-0882-4030-b104-193123762826
Someone can help me or give me SAP contact in order to solve this problem in Trial version? 
I've already spend 15 days with this problem and I don't want to finish the trial without any answser about this

I agree that creating a model/data set with file is not working on SAC Trial system and is throwing an internal server error. You can raise it with SAP. I created a blank model by creating the dimensions first and import the data as a workaround.

Hi, 
Can you please do the file validation,
1. like date column should have proper date format in all the row, no string etc should be present in the data.
2. Check measure also have proper data in the column.

Dear community,
I'm trying to build a CAP application using the Space "Full Stack with Productivity Tools" (the previous Low Code space),
it seems that after some deployments (It should be the third deployment) I always receive this error.
If I try to deploy using the terminal or using the classic Full Stack Space, I don't have any errors.
I don't know where to check some details about the error but no limits should be exceeded in our free tier.
Do you have any suggestions?
Thanks


Hi  Alessandro Spadoni ,
In free tier you are limited to two deployments only using the productivity tools.
Thanks,

Hi experts,
I´m using SAP BTP destination REST API Integration on SAP Build Apps, usually, I create a data entity with the "Create" operation, then, I configure the query on this section:

Previously, I only used the relative path to consult data, like this: "/PerPerson('" + query.record.d.personIdExternal + "')", and I called the values like this:
I assigned the values to a data variable and i can show them normally on the UI canvas, how ever, now I need to make a query with two filters, like this: 
"?$filter=externalCode eq '" +query.record.externalCode+ "'&$select=startDate,externalCode,name,description,status"
The test shows me the correct data:

Pitifully, I can´t show that values on my UI Canvas and I don´t know why, i had to make a manual schema because the test didn´t autodetect that from response, the schema is this:

So, I need help to use the data from the filter query, 
Thanks.

In our nodejs CAP application we use the minimalistic logging facade.
It does what it's supposed to do. But when it comes to Kibana and Request Correlation it doesn't.
As you can see in the following screenshot IMHO it should set the correlation_id with the one it wrote to the log message and that's used in the request (upper table).
Did anyone succeed with this? Is it an error? Do I misunderstand the documentation?


I am extracting Sales Document Item data by using 2LIS_11_VAITM from R/3 to BW. After extracting, I found that values of several fields are different between the source documents and the result of extractor in some records. I recognize that 2LIS_11_VAITM are directly extracted from mainly VBAK and VBAP through Delta queue.
For example: 
・Some values of KZWI1 - KZWI5 (Subtotal1-5) are 0 in VBAP whereas the extractor result is more than 0.
・AEDAT(Last Changed On) is 2015/06/28 in VBAP while 00000000 in the extractor.
Debugging 2LIS_11_VAITM with rsa3, I couldn't find any extractor logics for KZWI1 - KZWI5 or AEDAT in MCEC_BW_LO_API. I have no idea what causes the difference in values.
Is this because there are some kind of logics to manipulate values when VBAP data is put into Delta queue or Delta Update for the Sales Document Item didn't work? 
Thanks.

In SAP ECC I have planned independent requirements and requirements field. the PIR is for forecast and the requirements are for preplanned customer (schedule) orders. When one of those schedule orders is converted to an outbound delivery, does that only come off the requirements or is that consumed from the PIR also. There is no planning strategy set up in MRP 3 if that helps.

Hello All: 
I recently added a start and end book page in my demo simulation. The settings are w = 1200 and h = 800. During a local playback the width and height are fine. After publishing and playing the simulation, the width and height of my title and image have decreased in size. The title has moved from the right end of the slide and is positioned to at least 75% of the page. The image that was on the bottom of the slide has moved up about 25% from the bottom. The simulation pages are w = 1386 and h = 784. I created two new book page templates to match the simulation's slides width and height and republished. The same error occurs. Can anyone please assist? Thank you.
Hi Benjamin,
When playing back content on Manager, it's important to ensure that the content is published but also the templates used to create the content and the Resources.  Please ensure that everything is published and try again.
If the issue remains after everything is published, are you using a different monitor to playback the content locally to the one used to playback the published content?  You can have Enable Now automatically adjust the size of the content, i.e. make it larger or smaller, depending on the monitor used for playback.  To use this feature, set the Zoom for Desktop Playback and Zoom for Mobile Playback settings to Zoom to Fit for all relevant Simulation types and republish the Playback Settings object in Resources.

RegardsShane
Hi Shane:
Thank you for your detailed response. I am publishing the course as a SCORM through the Producer. The issue I face is only occurring on the start and end book pages in the demo simulation.

When I select the Trainer's previous icon, then I get what you see below. I appreciate your feedback. Thank you.

But their attributes are shown like this in the target element:

I tried changing their name in mymodulecore-locales_en.properties:
type.Videogame.publisher.name=Publishertype.Videogame.developer.name=Developer
type.Videogame2PlatformRel.videogame.name=Videogamestype.Videogame2PlatformRel.gamingplatform.name=Available Platforms
But that doesn't do the trick. How can I change it?
Thanks in advance!
What you did was correct, did you already do update system with localized types enabled? If no please do update system with localized types enabled, and then restart the server.

Hello Team,
I wanted to check if anyone is able to setup/customize the Contract Approvals in the manner below. Currently in Ariba, when a Contract Workspace (CW) is created for lets say $5M Approved Budget amount, it goes to 4 approvers based on the approval limit. When this CW goes for an amendment for another $1M, the total Approved Budget amount now will become $6M. As per the standard Ariba functionality, all 4 approvers who approved the initial version will again need to approve the CW. Can some one please tell us if any of you have seen/worked on the below scenarios and how it was achieved.
1. Our business wants to trigger the approval flow only the increased approved budget amount i,e in the above example, the first amount is only increasing the CW amount by $1M, so it should only go for approvers who can approve CWs up to $1M.
2. Also, during multiple amounts, we use the same field, Contract Approved Budget amount, in terms of reporting, how can we capture what was the approved budget amount in the previous versions of the Contract Approved Budget amount? If am not wrong, the current reporting facts cannot help us with looking at different Versions/amendments of the CW and give the details of Approved Budget Amount for that particular amendment or version of the CW. On each and every version/amount, the approved budget amount in reporting shows only the current value.
Thanks,Velu

Dear all,
We used to control the visability of tiles by separating the tiles from the target mapping like it is described in a blog of Carola Steinmaier:
SAP Fiori Launchpad – Control Visibility of Tiles by Separation of Tiles and Target Mapping | SAP Blogs
Now we moved to FES 2020 where we can use spaces and pages for even better structuring our FLP. So far this works fine.
As we have 100+ apps and around 30 differen business functions to migrate from SAP portal to FLP we would like to use the same procedure with separating tile from target mapping. This also works fine for the tile itself and for sections of pages but it does not work for the page itself nor the space. I.e. even if there is not a single tile on the page or space, the pages and spaces will still be displayed... whereas groups which do not have a tile are completely hidden.
Is this a bug or are there ways to hide empty pages and spaces? Are there perhaps other concepts to achieve this?
Thanks in advance and regardsGabi
Hi,Is there a solution now to hide empty pages and sections for end users?

Dear All, 
I am checking the discount functionality in SAP Customer Checkout. We are working with SAP Customer Checkout Manager as a backend system.
I can see that, when we create a customer in SAP Customer Checkout Manager, it is possible to assign a discount percentage to this customer, that is later synchronized with SAP CCO and automatically applied in the receipts for that customer.
When the customer is created directly in the POS (NOT in SAP Customer Checkout manager), I dont see the field where I can indicate the discount percentage for that customer. Is this only possible in CCO Manager?
Thank you so much.
Kind regards.
Hi,

In the PA30 Screen, Infotype - 0006, when the user is updating/creating a Subtype, concurrently another Subtype under the same Infotype must get updated.

I used the FM HR_INFOTYPE_OPERATION in a separate report and Submit this report in the Exit. the database ( Pa0006 ) updates properly.
The problem is that after Getting the message "Record Created", when I go into the Overview Screen or directly click the "Display" icon, the subtype which was to be updated through the exit doesn't show the new value under the subtype at that time. However when I go for "Change" icon or when I come out of PA30 and see again, the values reflect properly. 
I have tried NOCOMMIT under HR_INFOTYPE_OPERATION or even tried to use COMMIT WORK and WAIT separately.. None of this seems to be working..
Any clue??
Hi Varun,

This is because all the data is already there in internal tables of PA30. So it is not reading DB again to show the values. When you start the new session of PA30 or start the session in change mode(DB change will going to happen) then you get your updated value.

Regards,

Hi ,
I am using CAP for build an application on HANA Cloud. I have used CSV file to do some testing. However, while deploying to production, i want to ignore those files?
Is it possible by some configuration (for example in Package.json)?
Regards,
nitin
The better solution might be to move the CSV files containing test data to the folder test/data. cds watch is loading CSV files contained in the test folder by default while cds watch --production does not. Same holds true for production build and deployments, e.g. cds build --production, cds deploy --to hana --production. 
Make sure that CSV files intended for testing aren't deployed to production by mistake as this would impact subsequent HANA deployments.
See also [providing initial data](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/databases#providing-initial-data).
Hi Nitin,
I don't know if our solution is the best one (wait for other answers before accepting this one :) ), but we solve it by adding the following lines in the mta.yaml:

I have a set of ASP web pages that have worked for years. I have had them installed and working on one of my customer's server machines, also for years. Two events occurred within weeks of each other: My development machine got destroyed by a glass of cola, and my customer installed a new server. I thought this would be a good opportunity to upgrade my setup to Visual Studio 2022 and install the latest version of Crystal Reports, SP33. Let me state that these programs work fine on my development machine, and state again that the programs have been working fine on both ends for years.
The programs all work with the same basic style: I go out and collect some data into an ADO dataset, then attach the dataset to a Crystal Reports document using a report previously developed against an XML scheme file created from the schema of my dataset during development.
The error occurs on the line:
 crReportDocument.Database.Tables(i).SetDataSource(dataset)
using a crReportDocument and a dataset created just prior. I get the error: "Error in file {report name}.rpt. Failed to load database information"
As everything works fine on my development machine, I feel it is most likely an environment issue. I have been working on the server, and have spent hours combing the internet and have tried every proposed solution I could find: Unloading and reloading the SP33 64 bit runtime msi program on the server (making sure to run as admin), installing the SP33 32 bit runtime as well, going into Control Panel and repairing both of them, uninstalling everything and installing VS2022 Community and the SP33 Crystal Reports Developer package, making sure the crdb_adoplus DLL is present, inserting the 'Legacy' entry into my .config file, but they all make it to the same point and fail when trying to set the ADO dataset as the report's runtime source of data.
Looking for anything else to try next.
Found the problem this morning. For some reason I had a copy of the file Crystaldecisions.Web.dll in my bin folder. I have no idea how, when, or why it was in there. It was the current version, but maybe things failed because the application couldn't find any of the accompanying files and gave up.
Thanks to all who offered help.
Hey there. Not sure if I fully understood the issue, but take a look at this one: https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2420739 might help. 
Could you add some info on the DB you are trying to connect to? Could you check DB client bit versions potential incompatibilities between client server etc? 
In the Crystal for VS wiki there are a couple of references to what you need to do to get ADO.NET datasets to work with newer SPs of the SDK - one in the SP21 release notes and one in the SP26 release notes.
You might also want to check this blog: https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/30/upgrading-a-visual-studio-2008-2019-.net-project-with-the-latest-cr-.net-sdk-packages/

LegacyMode is no longer required in VS 2022 and CR runtime, remove that from the config file and it should work again.
And I don't suggest going back to previous versions of the runtime, 1st issue is they used Flash for parameters which should have been removed from your PC so those will no longer work. There have also been Security updates which you should be using as well.
2nd is we don't patch this product, so use the latest, if the issue still persists we can escalate it for a bug fix.

Hello,
we have key users who have used query variants under NW750. Now we have upgraded to SAP BW/4HANA 2021. In RSRT the button “query variants” has been deleted. Is there any chance to locate these variants because they are user dependent?
Alongside we try to give the key users the authorities for the BW cockpit, but only for data display (infoobjects, hierarchies and queries).
But the SAP role SAP_BW4_REPORTING_USER has insufficient authorities (no tile appears in the cockpit), but there are no authority errors. The other SAP roles (BW/4HANA-administrator, authority administrator, modeler, operator, developer) don’t seem to fit for the keyusers. Are there any ideas? 
Otherwise we have to check all authority objects of the other SAP_BW4_* roles step by step.
 
Thanks in advance 

One of our customers has already integrated AN with S4 H thru CIG for SCC. Data Center Europe. The same AN has to be connected to the ECC system as well.
For the same customer , B&I is now activated and when CIG is enabled it is pointing to US Data center , with a new P User. B&I should be connected to ECC. The CIG which is enabled is not the one which is in use for AN-S4 integration.

 Questions... 

How can we use the same CIG for both AN ( SCC ) and B&I ? Ideally only CIG should be used to my knowledge for all Ariba Solutions.
Can we use 2 different CIGs for AN and B&I?
Why has it created 2 different CIGs here , is it because of 2 data centers?

Hi, if your customer already has integrations for AN with EU datacenter, you should open a case/SR to request the configuration of Buying in EU realm so you can have the 2 solutions in a single CIG/Integration Suite Managed Edition.
https://connectsupport.ariba.com/sites#item-view&/KB0406207
Important note https://connectsupport.ariba.com/sites#item-view&/KB0405508 there are no migrations from EU to US if you try to change AN integrations in this case, the recommendation should be to leave all realms in EU (since customer already have integrations here) in this case.

How are you? If I understood you correctly, you want to see the Materials needed in a Maintenance Order as Components, their Requirement Quantities and their Available Quantities, correct?
In this case, inside the Maintenance Order, for the Area/Tab of "Operation Data", you can go to Area/Tab "Materials" inside, where you can see the Required Quantity of a Material ("Quantity" Field and, through "Settings" Button (Gear Image), you can select also the Field "Confirmed Quantity" to check, respectively, if the Quantity is available.

Wir sind interessiert am Produkt Crystel Report und Crystel Report Designer.
Ich habe Fragen zum Produkt.

Muss für die Nutzung von Crystal Report und Crystel Report Designer Open JDK installiert sein?
Wenn ja, sind die Open JDK Lizenzen im Produkt Crystal Report und Crystel Report Designer enthalten?

 Gibt es eine Möglichkeit Crystal Report und Crystel Report Designer ohne Open JDK Lizenzen zu nutzen?
No, you do not need to have Open JDK installed to use the full version of Crystal Reports.  However, if you're going to create an application using SAP Crystal Reports, version for Eclipse, you will need to have some form of JDK.  That licensing is not included with the SDK.
You could potentially get around the need for a JDK by using the .NET SDK - SAP Crystal Reports, version for Visual Studio - to develop your application.
-Dell
The Crystal Report Designer comes with a shipped in JDK as far as I could find out. According to your response the software package of SAP uses an Oracle JDK. Since Oracle changed their license model I would like to know how SAP licensed their shipped in JDK.
CR actually comes with a SAP JDK because of Oracles Change. So it's included and no extra licensing is required.

Hello,

If your client is implementing Solution Manager, you will have the standard questionnaire available.
Otherwise, if your implementation partner is having a different methodology, you will have to follow the same.

You can download the some available sample questionnaires from the net.

http://sapdocs.info/2008/12/19/questionnaires-for-business-blueprint/

In the similar way, you may have to develop a questionnaire.

Hope this is useful.

This requests are done by machine A (Hana) to machine B (SL).


I don't find anything about that type of request in Service Layer documentation. 
I need to know what is that request and if it is normal to have that massive requests from Hana Database to the SL Server.

Hi Ismail,
Is your "Percent" scale measure a formula in the model?  Probably it does not matter if it's formula or not, in my example it's formula.
I've made a very interesting observation. If the "Percent" scale measure is displayed only in the table then it does not show "%" sign! But once any of the other measures added then "%" is displayed.  This is not case for charts, it's only happening for tables.
Only Percent measure:

Percent measure with others:

Hi Ismail,Did you try this ?

Hi experts,
We are looking for best solution in SAP S/4 for health insurance company with large volume of documents (50 million items per year).
We are considering FIAR, FICA/FSCD.
FICA/FSCD aggregates items into the total records , which are transferred as summary to the general ledger. But business requirement is to have separate FI line items in G/L (BSEG, ACDOCA ), without aggregation.
From that reason we would like to use FIAR.
Is it a good idea to use FIAR on S/4 hana (with data aging for FI_DOCUMENTS) , for this volume of data, mainly from performace point of view ?
Regards
Jaromir
Hi Jaromir,
for this high volume of documents, you should use FS-CD. 
 
Hopefully the business requirement to have separate FI lines is only valid for some exceptional cases. 
In general, there is a direct drill down from FI G/L document to all summarized FS-CD subledger documents possible. If you still need line item per line item from FS-CD in FI you could control it on 
· document header DFKKKO-XEIBH:  If you select this indicator, the system will create a separate document in the SAP General Ledger for this FS-CD document. The number of the document posted in FS-CD is stored as the reference document number in the G/L document.
· Bp item DFKKOP- XEIPH: If you set this indicator, then another separate line item is created in the general ledger transfer document for this line item. This item is not summarized with other line items (as is usual when creating the totals records), even if there is identical account assignment.
· GL item DFKKOPK- XEIPH:  If you set this indicator, then another separate line item is created in the general ledger transfer document for this line item. This item is not summarized with other line items (as is usual when creating the totals records), even if there is identical account assignment.

how do I get trial product key?
Hi,
Login to Software Free Trials | SAP and select the product you want to try. 
You need to provide your email ID and other information as requested and you will receive the trial key (I think it will be valid for 30 days and can be extended further) will be shared to your through an email from SAP.
Thanks,
Raghavendra
No it can't be extended, be sure to test as much as you can before it expires.
Ah, something they changed, likely because so may people ran out of time... 
Thanks for the update.
Hello Experts,
I do have a Fiori list report developed using SAP Fiori elements. I need to dynamically change the column headings.
I have a filter called "Period" which can be selected as "Monthly" or "Weekly". When the user has selected the "Monthly" option, the columns should have headings for next four months, like:
03/2023 04/2023 05/2023 06/2023 
When the user has selected the "Weekly" option, the columns should have headings for next four periods, like:
Calender 09 Calender 10 Calender 11 Calender 12 
How can I achieve the same, possibly with custom JS code in the front-end? Especially for the one which developed with Fiori elements.

Hi, we have a scenario where, during a replenishment, a full HU is moved from high rack to a work center and a second WT is created on hold to move the partial stock from the work center to the picking area. We are looking a way to (after the confirmation of the second WT) get a third WT created automatically to return the HU from the work center to the high rack area. How this scenario can be achieved?
Thanks!
Hi Lucas,
are you aware of the functionality "Return Transfer" in /SCWM/PACK (Tab "Change HU")?
With that you can move the HU you have picked from back to the warehouse (manually as the picker decides when to move the HU).
In the settings of the work place (SPRO) you can define which storage type to return to and which warehouse process type to use for the movement.
Not sure whether that is the automation you are looking for, but at least the user does not have to perform an adhoc movement.
Best regards

Hi Experts,
we have a batch of CSV files in local system and would need to auto load the csv data to DWC system table.
can we do this via custom sql query and load into DWC ? or please let me know the ideal approach on how to automate the process of importing csv to datawarehouse cloud.
At DWC Roadmap a FTP based connection is planned for Q3 2021, and this option will allow to import CSV data with Data Flows.
At the moment it is not possible to do this automatically. There is no "CSV" connection type that allows remote access or use it in Data Flow. 
I have not tested it, but I think that an option, although complex, would be to use in DWC a JDBC connection, and to configure a JDBC driver to access CSV (there are paid ones and some open source). This would allow viewing the files as remote tables.

Other options are possible, but they involve using third party systems (HANA, Azure, etc) and access through these systems.
Dear All, 
I am checking the possiblility of assigning a percentage or fixed amount discount to an article in SAP Customer Checkout Manager vía API, so it can then be synchronized with the different POS that our customer has all over the country.
We are working with several price lists, since the same article can have different price depending on the city. 
For what I can see, in the Discount tab of the Article aplication there is no reference to the price list for discount. Is it possible to assign different discounts depending on the price list for the same article? Or the same discount will apply to all the price lists that are assigned to the article in the prices tab?
Thank you so much for your help.
Kind regards.
Hey folks
In CCO we'd like to discount a whole receipt or a material, but getting always message in CCO that material is not discountable. in CCOm article are set to be discountable. No option found in bydesign.
Any recommedation, help would be appreciated.
Thanks
Christian 
Hello Christian Frei,
I noticed articles are not marked as Discountable in CCO when they come from a ByD discount price list (which is maintained under CCO Configuration => Integration => SAP Business ByDesign Settings => General => Discount price list ID). Is it the same in your case?

Hello Gunther
Seems, yes. We had a Price List in the discount line. Will test further. This now seems connected to my other question I had re rebatte.

What is functionality of the report
Hi Sowmya.
I suppose you are talking about PRGN_COMPRESS_TIMES.
It deletes expired assignments and then tries to merge multiple assignments of the same role to a user (if their validity periods overlaps).

Thank you Marcelo. But some roles will be assigned manually and some through GRC.
In that scenario, how this will work?

Hi,
I need to setup 2 house banks under 1 Company code out of 2 company codes available in same country.
Both house bank accept different Payment medium formats.
I configure the new Payment medium format PMF1 to a Country say C1 in T.Code: FQP1
Say, This country have 2 Company codes CC1 and CC2. 
In FQP4, for one of the Company codes say CC1, The Payment medium format is assigned but not for other Company code: CC2.
When run FPY1, i get the PMF1 in template ran for CC2 which is not expected. We still want CC2 to be executed with existing Payment medium format say PMF0? 
Please advise.
Hi Ashish,
payment methods in TC FQP1 have a 1:1 relationship to payment medium format from TC FQP3.
So you have to set-up one payment method for company code CC1 with format PMF1 and a second payment method for company code CC2 with format PMF0.

Tobias

Kindly help in this critica issue:
We have a MSA repication that is managed by 2 rep servers, we def8ned replication definition at RS1, and define subscription at RS2, there is a route between them every thing was fine, we needed to resync the replucation , so when we run drop subscription at RS2, it took long time for some reason, so we deĺete the subscription let's say sub1 manually from rs_subscriptions table at both RSSD1 and RSSD2
NOW WHEN WE TRY TO DEFINE A NEW SUBSCRIPTION, WE GOT THE FOLLOWING ERROR : 
 ERROR #28186 dSUB( ) - eneric\sub\sub_gen.c(2205)

Hello  Joanna Qiu.
How are you? I have checked different Apps for Planned Orders, CDS Views for Planned Orders (Released and Non Released), SAP S/4HANA Cloud Help Portal for Planned Order Managemetn (Planned Order Management | SAP Help Portal) and SAP API Business Hub for Planned Order (Overview | Planned Order | SAP API Business Hub) and none of them have information regarding the Creator of a Planned Order. So, unfortunately, there is no Area in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition, where you can find information about Creator of a Planned Order.

Hello Experts, 
We are in Utility Industry, currently using Cloud Integration (Iflows) out of BTP/CF for integrating back end ECC (on Prem) to SuccessFactors and C4C/SAP Service Cloud for customer service. Most of the iflows are standard but we have some custom as well. 
We are trying to analyze the use cases for API management in our use cases. Since publishing of API to third party and monetization of API is not relevant for us, what value can API management add instead of directly using iflows from cloud integration?
What additional benefit can we get by implementing API management and publishing all the standard and custom iflow? 
Regards, Sanjoy
Hi Sanjoy,
think about creation of a central library for all your APIs of your SAP Cloud landscape, having documentations and open API specs available on 1 central place, like it's with api.sap.com. 
Having that in place, you're giving other, not SAP developers, the ability to search and re-use your listed and published APIs for other internal 3rd party applications. 
Think about publishing an API to get CostCenter Details on APIM and someone in charge for an Azure Microservice who is doing bookings for rooms is search for a opportunity to get the owner-details of a CostCenter. This would be a central approach to have all "available" API's of your Cloud landscape in place. Also think about the consumption of different APIs based on their scopes and the ability to identify who is consuming and in which amount (don't think about money, think about data-capacity).
Hope this helps.
Kindly advice me when we have two replication servers how or when transactions fare removed from the primary replication server ?
In our case even transactions applied in the destination database, the queues not purg its content
It almost will be full 
Regards
Conditions that can lead to stable device space not being truncated/released:
Another, albeit rare, occasion would be orphaned rows in rs_segments (ie, rows in rs_segments with non-zero q_number values that do not have a matching row in either rs_databases or rs_sites); fixing this issue would require direct modifications of the RSSD tables and is not recommended unless instructed by tech support.
Here's a good writeup for how long log records (where typically each log record corresponds to a row that was modified) are kept in the primary database's transaction log:
Repserver Admin Guide 1 -> SAP Replication Server Technical Overview -> Transaction Handling with Replication Server -> Transaction Processing by the Replication Agent -> Coordinate Adaptive Server Log Truncation
help.sap.com/docs/SAP_REPLICATION_SERVER/9dc6170db0d24bb9bc901a44187b0636/fd461172bd1c1014a9eecd86e9290823.html
The key point is, the secondary truncation point marks the log record that contains the begin transaction command for the oldest open transaction not yet fully applied by Replication Server. 
Transaction log rows in front of the the secondary truncation point (later in time) can't be deleted. Once the oldest transaction commits to all the replicates, the secondary truncation point on the primary can be moved forward (to a more recent time), permitting all the trans log rows older than the secondary truncation point to be truncated.
I think the old transaction log entries don't actually get deleted until a periodic checkpoint operation runs in the primary ASE server. So there can be some lag between when the secondary truncation point moves and the transaction log rows actually get deleted. You can use "dump transaction <dbname> with truncate_only" to rush things (only truncates/deletes trans log rows no longer needed)
Hi experts,
We are working with ASR in S4H 2021 FPS2. We have direct distribution to EWM turned off because of the process of the customer. Now, when we create a delivery and save it, a freight unit is created. 
Then when we distribute the delivery to EWM via VL06D a second, almost identical, freight unit is wrongfully created in TM. This causes pollution in the system. We tried looking at the freight unit building rule, ASR integration but cannot find the reason behind the second created freight unit. 

This is happening after we upgraded form 2021 initial stack to the FPS2. Does anybody have an answer for this? 
Thank you.

Hi
I hope someone can help me with a problem query.
I need a query that will pick up the sales order value before tax it also needs to show the SO number, Customer name and Code, the user would get a condition to enter the sales order number which is something like 25644 for example to bring up the information. This part is fine and the query is straight forward however, the query also needs to use a UDF called 'Inter Proj Num' which I've placed on the Sales Order screen.
 This will have another Sales Order number in this field and links to a sub project that may of been created when a customer wanted an upgrade / addition to the original sales order. 
So the query I need is for it to show the sales order info once a number has been placed by the user. If there is a number in the Inter Proj Num field as well it needs to look up that information as well and add that Sales Order amount to the total. As the two numbers will be for the same customer the customer details won't need to be duplicated.
For example:

Input sales order number e.g. 25455
Return sales order value where SO number equals 25455
Return sales order value where Inter Proj. Number is 25455
Above 2 items can be a total. They need to be exclusive of tax. Need

 I hope someone can help me fathom a way of getting this information together, it is much appreciated.
Hi,
Not sure it can be a total of the values for separate documents listed, but to get a query to show what you've asked, try this;
Though I think you might need to change '[U_Inter Proj Num]' for the UDF title, not the description...

check records in OCRD table, it could be that someone manually added one record with 9999999 code. Also, try running the code manually in Query Generator and checking the result. This should hint if there is a problem with the query, with value as stated above, or with trigger for your FMS.

Hello all,
The client wants to use NLAG material type (non stock, non value) for some of their purchases. I’ve created the Z* copy of the standard NLAG material type to be used.
If I am correct, by default, NLAG doesn’t have Accounting 1 view opened, right?
The request from client is in regards to the automatic account determination. When creating a PO with material that has material type NLAG, the account assignment is selected (K for example), but the G/L isn’t populated - it rather needs to be filled manually. If I understand correctly, this can’t be done because the NLAG doesn’t have accounting 1 and thus no valuation class, so it can’t automatically fill in the G/L. Client would want the automatic filling.
My question would be is it even possible to have automatic account determination in PO for NLAG (can we open accounting 1 view) or this is not possible?
Thanks 
Dear Aleksa Misic,
Indeed as NLAG isn't managed on value bases, you should not create accounting view for material with this mat. type.
Anyway you can maintain automatic account determination for materials without val. class.:
1) Check account modification for acc. assign. category "K"
SPRO->Materials Management->Purchasing->Account Assignment->Maintain Account Assignment Categoriess

2) Set G/L for materials w/o val. class in OBYC
Transaction OBYC -> transaction GBB -> General modification (acc. modification) from previous step (in this case "VBR") -> Valuation class "blank" (as for NLAG there is no val. class)

With this setting for all materials without val. class with acc. assign. category "K" will be automatically filed in specified G/L acc. during PO creation.
Let me know if clear and you can accept answer if helpful. 
Hello Experts,
We have an interface which is triggered by timer event and pulls data from an API and volume is huge. This API returns 10k records in one call and give you next key(10001) to use in next call, so we have put a looping process call. During tests, we found that tenant runs into problem while processing over 400k records. Messages are stuck in processing status and run-time node restarts itself. So we put the condition in looping process to either run 40 times or when NextTableName = -1( no more data). Problem with this is that you have to wait for next runs to load the data in receiver system(sftp).
What we would like is that once this interfaces runs and finishes; then it runs again depending on nextKey value. It keeps doing that till there are no more records. Is it possible and what is the best way to achieve that?
Any suggestions are appreciated.
Thanks,
Hemant
You did not say if you have any mapping requirements for transforming the API responses. If not, rather than collecting the records in one run, you might want to append them to SFTP file and while there are more records, call the same iflow using a SOAP adapter in asynchronous mode (caller does not wait for the provider to end processing), with HTTP headers for passing parameters. You kick off the process using a timer, which triggers the iFlow and then keeps calling itself in separate instances until all the records are read. Now you have an SFTP file to grab and transform and send to receiver. However, you might want to do that using SFTP look up in the last run of the iFlow when you find there are no more records to fetch. You need to make sure the SFTP file is not too big for CPI to handle though.
Which tcodes can I run on SAP to show all setup attributes attached to each Company code please?

Hello experts,we are just implementing the fiori My Travel and Expenses (Version 2) application.Does anybody know, how to disable the draft saving feature? I tried the following in manifest.json without success."sap.ui.generic.app": { "_version": "1.3.0", "settings": { "showDraftToggle": true, }}Thanks and regards
I'm not sure this is possible because if you want to add an attachment for example you already have to "presave" the expense note. Because it's not possible to link the attachment when the note is not yet saved (or they should have changed that)

You might check consulting note 3036184 - Button "Save as Draft" is missing

Note 3036184 - Button "Save as Draft" is missing looks good, but it is another problem. In this example- enter reason "Test"- click directly on Button "Save and Send"- only the message "Draft saved" appears. To "Save and Send" this travel expense you must click on the Button "Save and Send" again. This may confuse users.

The question is what kind of support do you need exactly.
The link you referred https://community.sap.com/support is about Community support (e.g. you cannot log on to community, found a bug on the community, etc). 
I also guess the link Dominik referred is CIC (e.g. you need a ticket speed up request, etc).

Hello,
is there any advice / documentation around deploying Customer Checkout Manager in a High Availability "cluster" / multiple Tomcat servers? I assume if this is done one can only have one "leading" CCOm executing scheduled jobs for example, also db-upgrades might be difficult to do without a downtime.
Is there a list / tips to consider when trying to do this?
Hello  Stefan Baust ,
This is an interesting topic indeed. I haven't seen any official documentation about it, yet.
However, here are a few ideas:
 I don't *think* you can safely run two tomcat instances connected to the same tenant. That would be something that would have to be carefully taken care of by the CCO team to avoid any concurrency issues. Maybe  Bikash Bansal can give his opinion on that topic...
Hope this helps.
Best regards,
Joerg.

And also here: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CUSTOMER_CHECKOUT?locale=en-US (main product page). 
I could not find much around high availability / clustering... 
As for a DB upgrade without downtime, this can be done with HANA DB if you have a Disaster Recovery setup in place (Primary HANA DB replicating to a secondary HANA DB). You can upgrade the secondary first while your primary is up and running (replication will be interrupted to do this), then set up the replication again, replicate from Primary to Secondary (you can do this from lower db version to higher but not vice versa), then switch over to Secondary as your new upgraded Primary DB, break replication, upgrade former Primary, reset replication, switch back over to original primary. 
System downtime is very minimal (few minutes to switch over when needed) with a short period where you don't really have a secondary system available if needed. 
Edit: This blog does not talk about high availability, but rather about installing more CCMs on one machine, but it may give you some hints to what you need and the author may be able to help you with info on High Availability setups.

I want to concatenate 2 variables V1 and V2 with space between them?
example:
V1 = 'ABCD'
V2 = '1423'
Expected result = 'ABCD 1423'
I tried concat() and replace() with lpad() to replace with space also but nothing is working in my case? And concat_with_space() is not supported in my system.
call concat twice then if CONCAT_WITH_SPACE is not supported.
Dear all,
While changing the valuation category of material 23270008 from blank to 'C' ( Split Valuation allowed ) at LN03, system is raising validation error because of Stock already exists in Plant and there are PO in which material is already opened . ( refer screenshot error step 1 , step 2 and step 3 ) 
 Actually , I need to define this material for another valuation type ( NEW ) along with with NEW1 valuation type in the same system . When trying via MM01 tcode , system is not allowing by saying " Valuation category doesn't allow split valuation" . ( see screenshot actual reason ) 
I want to resolve this issue without removing the existing stock and deleting/locking PO as suggested by SAP . Is there possible to change this error message from 'Error' to 'Warning' temporarily. I have tried the configuring the Message type via OBMSG and OBA5 tcode to change from error to warning . But it is not working ? Please suggest the solution
Material created with valuation category along with valuation type- no need to change valuation category whcih is not possible but if needed you can create new material code and do not use material 23270008  by keeping  stock zero and close all related open transactions. Better to delete and archive material 23270008 
Hello Varun Kumar Dogra
First, LN03 defines number ranges for WM quants. It has nothing to do with split valuation.
Second, as per note 155874 - Change valuation category in material master valuation category cannot be changed if stock, purchase orders, production orders, sales order or WM quants exist. There is no way around that.
You have to get rid of the stocks and the documents or create a new material master.

Hi, 
we're struggling with test script for scope item 5HO. 
In 5.1.2 Staging Release Order Parts for Production, a delivery is created. But there is no entry in the app Process Posting Change Item. Is there any app where we can edit this delivery? Also the pick parts run on error, though we followed the test script step by step. (Well, as far as possible, we also created a production order in order to release it and adjusted the components etc.) The only part that is working is ad-hoc movements. 
Has anyone done this test script successfully? Are there any additional steps we need to do that are not included in the script?
 Regards, Vanessa
Hi Vanessa,
Please check if the destination storage location is the same as source storage location in Create Control Cycle app, otherwise the delivery created during staging might be an outbound delivery and not a posting change.
Have you checked if there is any stuck queue related to this delivery created? You should be able to find it in Message Dashboard app (Namespace /LEEW must be assigned to your user in Assign Recipients to User app) or in Warehouse Monitor app?
Also, which error is thrown for the pick parts? Could you share a screenshot?

Hi ,
Is it possible to delete the "Business Partner" from master data. i am deleting it , because of duplication . Can anyone explain what is the procedure to delete. IF NOT , please explain why?
Hello,

Please note that it is not possible to physically remove a master record from the system. You can only make it unusable.

As business partner is the leading master data object, there is no concept of customer or supplier master data deletion. You can mark the corresponding business partner by navigating to General  Status and selecting Archiving Flag. 

However, you can mark certain customer and supplier specific master data at facet level. For customer, the following facets provides Deletion flag:

1) General
2) Company Code
3) Sales and Distribution

This indicates that all data in the master record will be deleted for the specified facet area. Before the deletion is made, the system checks for dependent data that would prevent the deletion.

Additionally, you can block a master data record by using the flag Central Deletion Block available at Customer: General Data and Supplier: General Data.

Dear Gurus,
I hope you are doing well.As the client's request, I need to enter the vendor's material number to the Master data of the material, however, I could not find any relevant field to enter such information. PS. the client has fixed materials that are supplied by fixed vendors, so they request to enter Vendor's own number to Material Master Data as well.It would be very appreciated if you help me in this matter.Thanks in advance!
Couple of things to keep in mind:
1) You've got to know the difference between vendor and manufacturer. They can be the same, but they don't have to. 
Vendor: Volkswagen Dealer in Lincoln, NE 
Manufacturer: Volkswagen 
2) Do not put the vendor's part number on the material master. That is not the correct place for that information to be. The purchasing info record stores all the information that gets created as a combination of vendor and material master record. 
3) The manufacturer's information can exist in SAP in the  material master record or you can even create a HERS record for  it. There's a field called Manufacturer Part Number in the Purchasing tab of the material master record that you can use it's MARA-MFRPN
Also note that the Vendor Part Number (aka. "Supplier Material Number") is also available in an Outline Agreement which will be adopted onto the Purchase Order line (even if a Purchasing Info Record exists for the same material/supplier combination with a Vendor Part Number in it). In other words, the Outline Agreement takes priority over the Purchasing Information Record.

Dear Community,
This is a know limitation in the RF system, we don't have a configuration to resolve it like the one to decide only the validation to, for example source bin, batch, and quantity; that is the example you provided.
However, there is a workaround to be able to change the layout of the RF screens, that you guys can adjust the screen in the way you prefer. For Cloud customers, SAP Screen Personas might solve this issue by using a script. An example can be found in the How-To guide, please check the attachment: 'ScreenPersonas_RF_EWM_S4H_Cloud'.

Hi all,
Has anyone linked an import model with a live model by date in a story in SAP Analytics Cloud?
I have very much data that I want to analyse, so my idea is to have an import model with overview data with dates and some measures. Then in a story be able to filter on date and fetch more detailed information from a live model. It is the same BW query used, but the date fields are not possible to link. I get "Columns cannot be matched" although I tried with both ID and Description.
 I think the problem is that the format of the same date field from import and live isn't the same.
If you have solved this, or have any idea how to do, please reply.

Dear SAP gurus, 
we have a framework agreement where the kickbacks shall be calculated in the following manner: 
 1% from 0 to 100'000, and 2% from 100´000 to 300'000, and 3% from 300'000 to 400'000.
 If we have a volume of 350'000 with a business partner, SAP needs to do the following calculation: 1%*100'000 + 2%*200'000+3%*50'000.
How can we design this in WCOCO? Is there any standard Scale Type that could cover this scenario? 
Many thanks in advance,

Hello David, 
graduated scales are not supported in Settlement Management.

You can add conditions to the contract in WCOCO in the condition table. Condition can have condition rate as %.

We often maintain (excel) files during Month End Closing (MEC) and we add them as separate tasks in AFC
Unfortunately links in AFC to internal directories will not work due to browser security issues.
As a workaround we write the internal link into AFC field "Customer Field 2". In the Process Closing Task App we include this field in the layout. Then we could copy this link to a new tab in the browser during MEC.
In order to copy the link we have to extend the witdh of the field so that total link could be seen and then only copy works. We have very long links so to save a maximum width in the layout is not fine as then the table layout is to bigand you need to scroll left and right..
But with a shorter width (see screenshot) I am not able to copy the full link.
Do you know a possibility to copy the full link without extending the width of the column ?

Not sure if this will work for you... and it would require help from the organisation IT, but in case you can do it, here is what I would do: 
- Set up an environment variable at the local work station level 

- Name can be what makes sense to you, but keep it short. Value will be the path to your central directory where you store the files you want to access (e.g. D:%HOMEPATH%\OneDrive FST\...). %HOMEPATH% takes you to \user\<username>. You only need to use %HOMEPATH% if the central location changes depending on the user accessing it. if it remains the same for all users, you can replace it with a static value, i.e. Variable Value would be: D:\users\johnsmith\OneDrive FST\... 
- You will have to work with IT to pass down this environment variable to all users that need to use it. 
- Then you can have a much shorter link, i.e. a lot easier to copy. 
I would only use this as a last resort in case you don't get a more elegant response, but I hope it helps :) 
That's an interesting solution we can come back if there is no other solution. Personally I prefer a solution without having to go in contact with our IT.Another solution e.g. having an easy opportunity to mark and copy a complete field in AFC would offer usgreater flexibility
Hello Gerald, 
why you do not use the "enhanced Weblink Functionality" to add there Folder Links? So you just need to change the Task Type once. We have not tested it sofar but it will be one of our next implementation change in AFC for the Task List, as we have the same need.

Hi, I'm wondering if there's anyway I can perform a 3rd Party Sales Order but upon the Goods Receipt from the Purchase Order, can the stock be received directly into SAP Unrestricted Stock?
Is it always for 3rd Party SO the Vendor will directly send the stock over to the customer? or there's a possibility where the Vendor sends over the stock to the warehouse and the warehouse delivers stock to the Customer?

Hello John, 
3rd party Sales Order cannot directly be posted in Unrestricted Stock. 
However there is a process - Individual PO Process", Here, we have to post Good Receipt before sending the Goods Out towards Customer. 
SAP Standard Item Category in this regards is TAB. 
Thanks,

Hello John Wayne,
If item category is TAS in sale order then stock directly dispatched to customer from vendor and if item category is TAB in this case goods will be received in warehouse and then dispatched to customer.

Hey,
I'm using a report that calls a function module in order to read an Excel-file.
I do this in the SAP GUI and / or in Eclipse IDE

on a PC (HP Zbook running Windows 11 Enterprise Version 21H2 - SAP GUI 7.70 - Eclipse 2022-03 (4.23.0) - ADT (s. screenshots below)) and
on a Mac (MacBook Pro 13" M2 2022 running macOS Ventura 13.1 - SAP GUI 7.80 - Eclipse 2022-12 (4.26.0) - ADT (s. screenshots below))

using the same Excel-file.
The function module behave similarly on the PC and Mac until this statement:
SET PROPERTY OF ls_excel 'Visible' = 0.
where ls_excel is defined as following:
DATA ls_excel type ole2_object.
After this statement the SY-SUBRC is 0 on the PC and 3 on the Mac.
Do you have any idea why this different behavior happens?
Just before the SET PROPERTY… line there is this statement
	CREATE OBJECT ls_excel 'Excel.Application'.
Could it be that this line must be different on a Mac?

However, the job settings only allow selecting version 16.15.0 or 18.1.0, which is not sufficient for my build. How can I resolve this?

Hi dear all.
I am searching a way to influence the strucure of an inspection lot during its creation (my process is an incoming inspection starting by MIGO transaction). I want the system selects operations from inspection plan with a specific rule (example : my inspection plan can have 10 operations, but sometimes I need only 3 relevant for my context).
But before starting to specify that for my Abap team, I am searching a relevant user exit or badi. The most relevant I found is QPAP0002 with especially the exit EXIT_SAPLQPAP_002. But this one seems to import only header level structure (I see only MAPL and PLKO, and not PLPO, and even less PLMK).
Am I on the right way ? Other way more relevant ? Your point of view please ?
Thank you.
Hi Oliver,
should be possible with BadI INSPECTIONLOT_UPDATE.
Within the BadI read your structure via select....
Thank you David and Holger.
David, I am not ready to propose Ref operation set at my customer. It will make the entire solution too complex and I don't feel that relevant for my case.
Holger, yes why not. I just hope the method CREATE_AT_SAVE from your BADI can work soon enough. I will chek with an abap man.

Hi,
I am using Odata V4 which lets the user select multiple records from the list report.
Is there a way I can disable this option ( check box to radio button ) tolet the user select only one record at a time.
I checked in manifest.jason but it does not have 'Pages' option as suggested in the following post.
Multiple line item selection using CDS Annotations | SAP Community
thanks in advance.
Hello Ramesh, 
you can use the Guided Development 
Open the Guided Development by right click on the project and choose Guided Development and find "Configure multiple selection in table" and then insert the code.
Or manually in the the SAP Fiori extension (Application Modeler, see picture)
In the Application Modeler choose the the project -> Pages -> right click on ListReport_XXXXXXX (your table page) -> click Show Source Code and copy the following code 

I hope that helps

Hi,
at my latitude, some consultants is telling customers, creating considerable dismay and concern, that MII will be discontinued on 31.12.2027 and that there will be no new releases beyond 15.5, the only SAP strategy is DMC. Is this also your opinion? It's so strange.
Thank you.
Bye.
Hi Ganimede,
In my opinion if SAP discontinues the improvements in SAP MII they will go back to zero in the manufacturing area. That is, as they were before the acquisition of Lighthammer.
Factory personnel still consider the SAP MII to be a good way to get data from SAP and also send it. That's what we still see in our customers. This is due to the speed with which we develop projects with MII and also to the reduced number of people involved in the SAP MII project. Things get easier.
We have already tried to offer SAP DMC to our customers and show some SAP solutions within BTP and our impression is that the factory solutions available within BTP are not so well seen by shop floor people who have decision making power.
In addition, there is a lot of resistance in factories when we talk about the cloud. Maybe that will change one day, but costs are still high and not everything can travel through the cloud.
Instead of discontinuing they could evolve the tool, I as a developer and customer would be very happy if...
SAP removes SAP MII from SAP NW and gives flexibility to create container in Dockers and have our applications according to the architecture of each project. That way we wouldn't be stuck with a server as big as SAP NW.
In this way we could create our local/cloud projects and have visualization projects (Intelligence) or integration (API) according to the SAP customer's needs. All this on-premises or in the cloud. SAP already has a standard in SAP MII and would follow suit, but the architecture is scalable whether on-premises or in the cloud.
We could have the solutions marketed in the SAP Store as they currently exist in other solutions.
Among other improvements, I believe that every SAP MII developer could contribute to improving the tool a lot. The potential is there and so are the customers. I just think that SAP with DMC is evolving into something that is not as widely accepted because of the challenges the industry still faces. The speech is beautiful, but the reality is different.
That's my opinion. I believe in SAP MII and that it will continue for a long time at SAP.
Regards,
Danilo Santos
So, seems that DMC is the new SAP strategy for Shop Floor, in Cloud, but with options to embrace the shop floor directly without disrupting it. 
And there are a lot of papers, comments, and announcements about DMC, but Mii has a short message. Considering that Mii and DMC require a significant investment, I understand that a clear position from SAP is necessary. 
Currently, we don't have any SAP MII releases planned beyond end of 2027, however, we are exploring the possibility to extend our maintenance window to end of 2030. SAP DMC is our go forward shop floor solution. We are in the process of establishing a program that will help bridge our SAP MII customers to SAP DMC in the coming years. Our next step will be to send out more communication on our plans in the months ahead.

DMC roadmap, what we can expect from DMC: https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=73555000100800001492⦥=CURRENT-LAST#Q4%202022
Hi Ganimede
That is correct but they do mention in the note "SAP MII releases is subject to changes and can be extended"

Hi,
in my event handler class, I need to get all reporting activities for a specific reporting task.
I get the reporting task with cl_srf_facade=>get_reporting_task method. Is there any way to get all rep. activities for this specific task? In CL_SRF_FACADE, there are only "get_reporting_activity" and "get_reporting_activity_by_id" methods, that aren't applicable for me in this case.
Is there any other way?

Hi All,
I was wondering if anyone has a better guide or example on how to implement the From generic pass. 
Reading the SAP guide https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_IDENTITY_MANAGEMENT/4773a9ae1296411a9d5c24873a8d418c/62e63e49bd2a4f32a5c8a119c54a7815.html?locale=en-US
The section on the Next Data Entry, Am I suppose to return all the entries into the script? For example I want to call a RestAPI to return all the user and its details using a From Genric pass into a table in IDM. 
But Am I suppose to just call one entry? How does the script know who the next entry is?
Your "Next Data Entry" script is supposed to return one DSE entry (as returned from a call to uNewEntry, for example) per invocation. When you have no more entries to return, return null instead.
The control flow is:
You'll need to maintain state between calls to "Next Data Entry" to know which entry to return next. How exactly you do this is application/use case-specific. The SAP BusinessObjects connector, for instance, reads all BOBJ users into memory on the very first invocation, then iterates over this set using a Java iterator and returns null when the iterator doesn't have any more remaining items. You could also read page by page if your REST API supports it, of course.The pass "Read BOBJ users" from the screenshot below shows which scripts are used; you may want to look at their sources to dig deeper into the details.

In case we are moving ECC to S4HANA 2021 or S4HANA 2022 how could we know Which transaction are available in target system or not. Like transaction Ck11 Transaction not available in S4HANA but in TSTC table in S4HAN it is maintain then how could we confirm that CK11 is not supported in S4HANA.

Hi,
We have a requirement, where we have to access data from the different(ERP) system with ABAP CDS View.
How can we achieve this?
Regards,
Khushdeep Singh
If you need to access remote data from within the CDS view, you can achieve this with help of virtual elements. With the help of IF_SADL_EXIT_CALC_ELEMENT_READ, you can run any custom code within your CDS view to calculate some fields. Your custom code can also access a remote system over RFC or something. For this to work, you need to publish the CDS view as an OData service, though.
Hello Khushdeep Singh Do you have a solution for this requirement? 
Hi,
you can expose the data from the CDS view as oData and consume it in a remote abap system.

Hi,
I am trying to do the task related to multi-language functionality but it is not working.
I have an entity in MySchema.cds defined as view:
entity MyView AS 
 SELECT key t1.column1, t1.column1, t2.column2
 FROM table1 AS t1
 LEFT JOIN table2 AS t2 ON t1.column1 = t2.column1;
In MyService.cds:
 entity MyView as projection on MyView;
Table table2 has a localized column2, and table table2_texts is filled in.
If I expose just table2 it works - In MyService.cds:  
 entity MyView as projection on table2;
But it doesn't work if the view is exposed as mentioned above.
Please for some idea or suggestion how to solve this issue.
Best regards,

Hi SAC Experts,
Some of our data actions fail sporadically, while on other moments, they run successful (with same scope & parameters).Sometimes they fail at the final 'Publish' step, sometimes they already fail at the 'Preparing to execute' step.
2 typical error messages we see in Data Action Monitor are:The data action "DATA_ACTION_NAME" couldn't run successfully on version "VERSION_NAME" because you don't have the resources available. Try restricting the scope or try again later.
or also:
The results of the data action "DATA_ACTION_NAME" could not be published on version "VERSION_NAME" . You don't have the resources available to publish this version. Please try again later.
1. Is there any way we can see easily which resources were used that essentially blocks our data actions from running successfully? We don't immediately see other actions, reports, etc. in the performance log & statistics stories.
2. We could accept during heavy/peak moments that data actions might run slower... but wouldn't want them to fail. Are data actions not designed to check during 'Preparing to execute' state if they have enough resources, and if not, just re-try a bit later?
How can we ensure better reliability? (except for the obvious refactoring of heavy data-action steps to best of ability)

If we are scheduling backups via hana cockpit for a HANA DB, the schedule gets stored somewhere in HANA DB. Does anyone know which table or monitoring view this schedule information gets stored in. I checked m_backup* views but cannot find it anywhere. Any help is appreciated.
SAP doesn't provide much information about this, this is what I could find: Monitoring Views for the Backup Catalog
The catalog is stored on the file system, not on the DB.
Hi, 

I´m trying to Enter a Transfer Posting, using the MIGO transaction, from an IM warehouse to a WM warehouse managing Handling Units (HU).

When I try to save, the System displays an error:

"Data for creating a delivery is incomplete (Vendor)


Message no. M7279

Diagnosis

The system found that the data required to create a delivery via
Shipping is not complete.

System Response

The system cannot create a delivery.
Procedure

Check that the data for Vendor is maintained in your system:

o loading group

o debtor number

o sales organization

o distribution channel

o division

o shipping condition

o shipping point"

Does anyone know wich one could be the problem?

WHERE, ALL THE ABOVE POINTS ARE CHECKED (loading grp to shipg point) BUT UNABLE TO POST THE MIGO .

PLS ADVISE

any of these can be the problem.

Do you have a customer master? is the customer master number entered in vendor master control data view?

Has the material master sales views for the sales organisation and ditribution channnel that is assigned to the plant that you want post the MIGO to? (has to be the sales org that can be seen in T001W table)

Is the loading group entered in material master?
is the shipping condition entered in customer master?

Is the shipping point determination succesfull? the access is made with plant, loading group and shipping condition.
I had the same problem and checked all data several times, everything was fine, and I still got the error. 
Then I checked table T001W and it WAS NOT UPDATED by the system! I added the plant to the vendor master through the menu, but T001W remained empty. I had to change the table T001W and now it is working. So if you have this error check T001W first.
Dear member,
As I understand, you are trying a return process for the vendor, via delivery. You may check the delivery plant for the customer master data of the vendor.
Hi All,
When I performed foreign currency revaluation by FAGL_FCV. I can find the selected AP invoice from the log successfully. (It can select the opened item successfully)



But I can't find the document number from the postings tap.




Not sure why it will skip the line and continue the number range from next line. It is so weird.
I can find it from other documents. They are same batch. So I think it is not related to document number range and posting period.

Error message as below from system log. 




Therefore, there is no accounting impact actually. But when I try to re-run the revaluation for a single vendor only. System will show that revaluation has been done for this period. Any suggestion for the issue? Is it a system bug?
Dear Derek Wong, 
You can refer to this thread:
https://answers.sap.com/questions/9387048/foreign-valuation-document-missing.html
And to SAP note 2887522 :
https://me.sap.com/notes/0002887522
You can accept answer if helpful.
Greetings,
Regarding the issue with generating the revaluation document due to foreign currency, there are two potential solutions that you can try.
Firstly, you can navigate to System -> Services -> Batch Input -> Sessions to review the created Session for your run. By processing this session, any potential errors will be identified, and if no issues are found, the FI document will be generated without any further action required.
In the event that the first option is not successful, you can attempt to Reset the Valuation and Re-perform the process. While doing so, be sure to closely monitor any Error Messages that may appear, as this will help you to better understand why the document has not been posted. From what I can see in your screenshot, there appear to be some errors present that could be causing the problem.
 
I hope that these solutions prove helpful to you.
Best regards,
Kateryna

You could use the warranty management functionality in SAP to handle this scenario.1. Create a warranty object in the system. This object will link the material to the vendor and it will contain all the information related to the warranty coverage.2. Create a warranty claim by entering the document number, material, vendor and the details of the defect.3. SAP will then check the warranty coverage and create a notification based on the parameters set in the warranty object.4. The vendor will then be notified of the warranty claim and will provide instructions on how to repair or replace the material.5. The material will then be sent back to the vendor for repair and/or replacement.6. Once the vendor has completed the repair/replacement, they will send the material back to the sender.7. The sender will then update the system with the new material and the warranty claim will be marked as closed in the system.

Hi,
Check for the Down Payment Accounts defined or not in the BP Master Data as well.

Hi,
The settings in GL Account Determination are default for new BP created. In your case, you have to define Down Payment Clearing Account and Interim Account in Business Partner Master Data.

Hope this helps,

Hi Team,There is a scenario for few records the data is not getting updated in Data Manager. However, the data shows successfully imported and moving the file to Archive folder.
The data comes from PI to MDM, In PI the data shows correct and messages also successful. However, for the few records, few fields are not getting updated and the rest are updating properly in MDM. Also we have checked Import manager and we see there are no exceptions .
Could you please suggest on this.

Hello Experts,
I am trying to add an attachment to an existing document info record(in S4hana cloud) using the API_CV_ATTACHMENT_SRV via CPI. Source system is SAP ECC from which I receive an iDoc with the url in one of the fields. When I enter that url in any browser or in Postman, I get a pdf file, but in CPI, I get the data in an attached format pdf-data-in-cpi.png. I am making post call to S4Hana and passing the pdf data in content parameter but getting attached error.png. Do I need to use base64decoder and then send the output of it to S4? Can anyone help me in understanding the issue.
Thanks in advance!

Hi Mohit,
You can refer the blog https://blogs.sap.com/2023/01/05/passing-base64-encoded-raw-content-as-attachment-pdf-to-s-4-business-object-via-attachment-api-using-cpi-as-middleware/ which explains a similar scenario where Base64 encoder was used to encode pdf data before uploading the file to S/4HANA Cloud.

Hi,
User is getting error for Lebanon tax category and Lebanon taxes I have attached the screenshot of error. The error is No calculation procedure has been assigned to country/region Lebanon. Can anyone suggest using Lebanon tax categories and taxes without config or we need to configure everything ourselves as per requirement. Thanks in advance for your reply.
Dear Pooja,Please check if the LB country solution is activated in your system.
You have to option to get the LB tax codes:1) You can activate LB country solution.
or
2) If the company code's country already activated TDT, than you can add new tax code/tax rate/tax account via related SSCUIs by yourself.
In this case you can find help in the SAP Help Portal pageTime-Dependent Taxes (TDT)https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/0fa84c9d9c634132b7c4abb9ffdd8f06/8fd78f3974b84e478dc99ae1ae1afc16.html?q=tdt

Hello,

to get a better structure in the created and already used Data Elements I would like to rename them.
Is it possible to change the name somewhere.

Many thanks

Markus
Prashant's is the safest solution. 

Here is an unsafe one. This can do the processing in Mass, through a program.

 In se37 , explore the functions RPY_dataelement*. 


Caveat Emptor- that is 'use at your own risk'.
Hi,

I think you can not Change the Name of Data element that are already created.
But if you want ot Modify that,the better you Copy that data
element and give the desire name of copied vaersion and Change whatever you want and activate it




Regards,
Sujit
This message was moderated.
Hi markus,

It is possible to change the Name of Data element that are already created, but its not advisable to do so because its existing usage in multiple tables/screens/structures Renaming may give rise to a lot of problem and you will not be knowing in how many tables/screens/structures its being used and where , so the best solition is what Sujit has give i agree with him .

Hope you got the answer .

Hello, for future viewers, you're better off to: 
Right click -> copy -> change name. 
This will copy the current data element in the same package, as a non-activate data element, which is good if you want to further modify it. But AFAIK there is no renaming / refactoring in SAP for data elements or domains. 
Good afternoon!
I have a question about IDoc, which will help us in further integration with SAP and non-SAP systems.
Maybe you can help me:
Is it possible to somehow automate the process of data transfer by systems using IDoc so that we don't have to start the data exchange process manually? 
and which integration method is better for the cloud version?
Hi Artem,
I would recommend you to follow the blog https://blogs.sap.com/2020/07/15/sap-s4h-idoc-to-sap-cpi-inbound-idoc-interface/ and see if it answers your queries.

Hi experts!Newbie here. I got information that, if the payment method is different between the child and parent, SAP will not pick up a bank account from the parent, is this a valid condition? or is there an issue with the child accounts? I have a situation where the payment goes tru the child bank account. The user said it should be on the parent bank account. How can I solve this problem? Thank you!Regards,Christian
Christian,
In a collective set up, payment method at the Child is irrelevant, as the payment method at the parent account drives the whole scenario as per standard SAP.
The only scenario where this may happen are for those receivables which are not tagged to Collectives, the reason may be they are posted before the parent child relationship was set up.
Thanks,
Amlan
Dear gurus,
I've an issue/question with loading time-dependent master data from HCM-Infotype to ZEMPLOYEE via generic datasource based directly on Infotype table.
HCM Infotype-Data
PERNR; VALID_TO; VALID_FROM; SUBTYPE; VALUE88888888; 99991231; 20140502; 9001; ABC88888888; 99991231; 20230101; 9002; 123
Requirement:

When Subtype 9001, I need VALUE (= ABC) in Attribute X in InfoObject ZEMPLOYEE
When Subtype 9002, I need VALUE (= 123) in Attribute Y in InfoObject ZEMPLOYEE

Problem/Issue
As InfoObject only has PERNR and VALID_TO as keys, VALID_FROM information is lost when loading to InfoObject. Therefore time intervals overlap (both records with VALID_TO: 99991231) and are not created/inserted correctly with DTP-setting "handling duplicate data records".
Expected result
MasterData Table of ZEMPLOYEE should look like this after load:
/BIC/ZEMPLOYEE; DATETO; DATEFROM; /BIC/ZATTRBT_X; /BIC/ZATTRBT_Y 
88888888; 01.05.2014; 01.01.1000; ; 
88888888; 31.12.2022; 02.05.2014; ABC; 
88888888; 31.12.9999; 01.01.2023; ABC; 123
Any ideas or best practise for this scenario?
Thanks!
If there are multiple records with the same characterstic key + DATETO but with different DATEFROM values, you get an error during the load. If the "handling duplicate record keys" is set, then chronologically the last record is updated.
Both situations are correct and the system works as designed.
If you need it that way, then you should split the interval in the endroutine of the Transformation with an ABAP routine and create the desired time intervals yourself. The master data loading considers the DATETO as key.

Hello Folks,
I am trying to use the table replicator operator in SAP DI, for initial and delta load.
Initially I tried the Initial and delta load in SAP HANA as source and target DB and it worked fine but now I have started working with actual data a source: Azure SQL DB, I ran the graph with table replicator operator and it failed with error " CREATE TABLE permission denied at the database".
I understand "CREATE TABLE permission at the source database " is one of the pre-requisites for table replicator operator, but how can I asses the changes being made by this operator at the source database. If I request this access from the DB team, would it be a right approach going forward in production as well?
Secondly, while testing with HANA DB(src and target), there are missing key and values ( max/no of batches and number of rows) in checkpoint table. Besides, shadow and shadow view are never populated with any value. Is that expected behavior or am I missing something?
Also, the primary key details of the source table are missing in check point table and the target HANA table.
Need suggestions!
Thanks,
Indu.

In all version the colum LstPwdChB is nvarchar(8), so this is not the cause, I believe!

hi,
in the sap note we can see this:
Workaround:
The root cause is that the length of a column in the user table is shorter than the length of the defined user code. You need to fix the database to solve this problem.
Question: which column in which table is shorter than the lenght of the defined user code and how to fix it? Please give more details. This workoround is unacceptable!

A user was able to to create models and also to schedule it (refresh import model). Sometimes it went wrong and the import model reported an error. The refresh issue was fixed by updating it manually. But since last week, the user can´t click the manually refresh button (button is greyed out). 
I as the administrator have not changed anything in the roles. But the user is also no longer able to schedule models.
- User is member of Team "QM Power User"
- "QM Power User" has the role "Content Creator"
1. Question: What privileges are required to set up schedulings for import models for the role "Content Creator"?
2. Question: Why does the automatically import scheduling doesn´t work contiously? 
Hi Yigit,
Is the owner of the model still the same user? I have noticed that being able to schedule a job or refreshing manually is depending on who is the owner. Any other error message of warnings displaying when you hoover across the greyed-out button?
Kind regards,
Martijn van Foeken | Interdobs

Hello Experts!
I'm facing an issue when annotating an action with Side Effects in my odata v4 service. In accordance with the documentation (under "Side effect after executing an action" for odata v4) I've annotated my action in the following way:
// schema
entity MyEntity {
    valueChangedByAction: String;
}

// service
service MyService {
    entity MyEntity as projection on db.MyEntity actions {
        action myAction returns MyEntity;
    };
}

// Annotation
annotate MyService.myAction with @(
    Common.SideEffects: {
        TargetProperties : [
            // Unsure what to put here, tried many variations
            // valueChangedByAction
            // MyEntity.valueChangedByAction
        ]
    }
);
Calling the action does not refresh the desired value. If someone could point out what I'm doing wrong it would be much appreciated!

Hi Experts,
I am trying to update t=data through SAP NW gateway using the /IWBEP/IF_MGW_APPL_SRV_RUNTIME~UPDATE_ENTITY method.
I am using REST Client in firefox browser to test the update service. 
Steps Followed .

1. used GET method to get the x-csrf-token (and that was successfull)
2. Using the obtained x-csrf-token, i am updating the data (PUT)
3. Updated the body XML with some data .

Here i m getting the return error - System expected the element '{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}entry'
How ever the request which i made is reaching G/W . 


Please help me on this. I am really stuck. Whether to change something in gateway side, or in the XML side.
Thanks in Advance..
Hi Now its working perfectly.
Problem was with the XML body.
Instead of the previous one, i used thew below. 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><entry xml:base="**:8000/sap/opu/odata/sap/ZMAKT_DESC_SRV/" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/metadata" xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices"><id>http://**:8000/sap/opu/odata/sap/ZMAKT_DESC_SRV/Makt(Spras='E',Matnr='1')</id><title type="text">Makt(Spras='E',Matnr='1')</title><updated>2013-10-24T03:42:55Z</updated><category term="ZMAKT_DESC_SRV.Makt" scheme="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/scheme"/><link href="Makt(Spras='E',Matnr='1')" rel="edit" title="Makt"/><content type="application/xml"><m:properties><d:Maktg>Double dukker</d:Maktg><d:Maktx>Asset Procurement</d:Maktx><d:Spras>E</d:Spras><d:Matnr>1</d:Matnr></m:properties></content></entry>
You will get this error when the XML in the body is not right. Use the XML validator in GW Web Client to validate it. 
As Ron pointed the problem is with your request body. May be you can post it here.

How did you compose your request body xml?
In my blog on Gateway Client, I have written on how to compose the request body for Update Request as well.

I just encountered this problem and it was cause by "bad whitespaces" in the payload which I found with an XML schema validator:

Hello SAP Community, 
i have executed the CVI_PRECHK and got the error on customer as well as vendor side, that the number range of customer / vendor is not in range of the number range given with the accounting group. Over the years some vendors, for example, have changed with XK07 to another accounting group. Same as with customers. 
I have no idea how to solve this issue as it is technically not possible with XK07 or XD07 to change them back. 
How have you solved this issue while integrating customer vendors to BP?
Thanks for your help!
BR 
Sven 
Hello Sven,
I assume you are running the synchronization from Customers/vendors to BP. If that is the case and considering the changes you made, one alternative could be to assign a different number to your BPs. 
Although it is recommended to assign to the BPs the same number as the customers/vendors, the truth is that this is not always possible. Therefore, for some scenarios, it is common to assign a different number. 
Please check section 7.3.8.2. Number Ranges and Groupings from your CVI Cookbook
Thanks and regards,
Jose M.
Hello Sven,
As far as you are using TCode XK07 - Change Account Group (AG), I guess it could depend on the current state of the CVI Sync of that Customer to BP + your NR Customizing. Due to the change of the AG, it seems that system will try to create BT (if the customer hasn't been synchronized earlier) in the NR that should correspond to the Customizing of the target AG. If you are using an external BP NR with the same numbers option, it could be a bit tricky, because your Customer number will be from the legacy NR (different, from the target AG). That is why it's likely that you can run into such a problem.
Feel free to provide some more details to discuss.
Best regards,

Hi,
Currently we are manually reposting the cost from cost centre to internal order through KB11N in proportional amount, while the proportion is calculated in excel. how can we automate this process of reallocation?
is it possible to use Assessment cycle for it or any other way for reallocation?
Thanks

Hi,

We have BW 7.4 with a HANA database.

The standard DSO contained appr. 200 Mio. data records and active table had the disk size about 32 GB. This size I have seen in the transaction DB02 under "Diagnostics" -> "Tables/Views".

Then I have deleted appr. 190 Mio. data records with "selective deletion" in the manage window of DSO. But the size of the active table on the disk is not reduce. 

Is this a right behaviour? How can I reduce the disk size of the table on HANA?

Thanks for assistance

Peter
Hi Peter,

If you have large data for your selections table size should reduce.
you can see the real size by querying (SQL) view M_CS_TABLES in HANA studio. This gives you information regarding the specific table such as total memory size, delta memory size, etc. SELECT * FROM "SYS"."M_CS_TABLES" WHERE TABLE_NAME = '/BI0/A0SD_O0100';(Active table).

If you want reduce sizes split your data into physical partitioned objects (using semantic criteria/Partitioning commands) to avoid tables with more than 500 million records. Other attractive way of reducing the size of a table (and optimizing the In-Memory sizing requirements) can be using BW’s Nearline-Storage (NLS) capabilities (e.g. Sybase-IQ).

Regards,
Joseph
Hi Peter,

Can you try delta merge process on the DSO ? And also try to unload it from memory and try loading it back and see if it now reflects the correct size.

Regards
Manpreet
Hi all,

I mean the size on the disk.
Today I have copied the original DSO to the test-DSO and copied the data from the original DSO to the test-DSO. Both DSO's have now the same data, same amount of records. 
Now we can see the difference between the size on the disk.

This is the original DSO:

and this is the copied DSO:

My expectation was, that the size of the tables must be are equal. But it is not.

How I can shrink the table of original DSO that both table have the same size?

SQL statement for the defragmentation was executed:
"alter system reclaim datavolume 'volume' 120 defragment". It wasn't helpful.

Regards

Peter
Hi Peter,

I woud expect HANA automatically takes care of this within a few days after the deletion. However, I am not aware of any way to speed up this process or did you find anything?

Nico
Hi Colleagues,
Whenever an error in SAC pops up, there is an "Expand" button. When you click on "Expand", you it shows a "Correlation ID". 


What is this for? 
What is the added value of it? Why do I need it?
And, most importantly, how do I, as an end user, disable this - if I clearly don't have a use case for this.
Maybe it is something your Admin could help log/monitor/troubleshoot - see SAP Help at https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_IoT/fffd6ca18e374c2e80688dab5c31527f/a984955d878c42a1b8526848bedcf1d6.html
and I also like what Vitaliy says here: https://answers.sap.com/questions/13673313/model-information-cannot-be-found-correlation-id-4.html "the Correlation ID is unique to your instance. If you have admin privileges you can see more details for the correlation id in SAC in System -> Monitor -> Trace."
Hi Igor, on top of what Tammy mentioned, correlations IDs can prove very helpful to our SAC support engineers and SAC development engineers when troubleshooting product issues. We have tools in-house SAP that can relate correlations IDs and stack traces for our development engineers to keep a deeper & hopefully better understanding of what is likely causing the issue (if due to the product itself). As a best practice it is recommended for customers & partners to copy/paste the correlation ID as text in the support ticket in addition to screenshots. My 0,02 cents, Antoine
Hi community,
I facing an issue with CCO, i had SP12 PL 00 and my backend is SBO 9.3
My currency is $ (USD), and had to map in CCO
The problem is, the discount or quantity discount not change the price of the product, i mean, if i set volume discount for 2 items for $5 dollars, and the regular price is $6.99, in CCO calculate 2 x $6.99 + tax, instead put $10.00+tax
Howerver, the group discount works perfect, but i need volume and period discount.
Also, how can i set a promo where 2 different items (Item A and Item B) that has the same price ($6.99) when i buy together give me $10.00 both.
Thanks in advance
Hi Isaac,
Please, provide us some screenshots of your Period And Volume discount in the SAP B1 and the some screenshots of the CCO when adding the items in the Sales Screen.

Hi all,
Do you know if the latest jdbc driver for hana (ngdbc.jar) supports fetchSize ? when we call setFetchSize of the preparedstatement like below, will this be regarded by the server?
stmt.setFetchSize(1000)
Regards,
Bai
The first rows (32 by default - changeable in HANA) are returned by HANA, then the setFetchSize is honoured.
Have a look at the document attached to https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2494160 on page 27.

Hello,
Yes it is supported for our config
You can check M_SQL_CLIENT_NETWORK_IO, with bigger fetchsize you got less rows in that table.

Hi
First of all, I would like to apologize since I am a newbie on this topic. The fact is that I would be interested in knowing how I could obtain the xml (or json) output of a specific ByD Sales Quote. Currently I can go directly to a Sales Quote with the url:
https://myXXXXXX-sso.sapbydesign.com/sap/byd/nav?bo_ns=http://sap.com/xi/AP/CRM/Global&bo=CustomerQuote&node=Root&operation=Open&object_key=____{"SQnumber"}____&key_type=APC_S_BTD_ID
But it would be very useful for me to get its data directly from a url to parse some fields on an excel file. Is it possible?
Thank you
Hi Oliver Harris ,
Maybe this works for you:
1. Download Data XML via Output History of the specific quote:

2. Have a look ath the Webservice APIS: https://help.sap.com/doc/a2b4c7ef61d64397b2b1d052082a8a08/2302/en-US/IntegrationServices.html
There are 3 Webservices listed containing "quote", maybe one of them fits your needs.

We have a story built using analytics designer with metrics from 2 different models (acquired connection) and the models are linked on a common customer dimension at the story level.
Ex: Model_1 has 2 customers (cust1, cust2) and Model_2 has 3 customers (cust1, cust2, cust3). 
When we link on the customer dimension I am only getting intersecting data. The "All data" is not working. Please help!
Our SAC Version: 2023.3.1
Thank you in advance!

Hi Roopa Puranik 
I've seen this product behaviour before, and "All Data" link type is probably greyed out for a reason.

HI Experts 
Good Day ,
We are having some data load performance issue in Asset management flows specially for FI_AA_11 which is taking more then 5 hours as its currently full load.
we are thinking of converting FI_AA_12 and FI_AA_20 in Transaction data and 0ASSET_ATTR_TEXT and 0ASSET_AFAB_ATTR in to Delta load but wanted to understand if we are missing something as Asset Management works in different way 
We have gone through the OSS note 2962277 this looks like S4HANA note (not sure) and still in R3 system . In the OSS note we have one BAPI FIAA_BW_DELTA_UPDATE
if you have converted these flows into Delta can you please help us understand if we are missing something or share the steps taken / Issued faced for the same.

Is there a possibility to add multiple account determination group for customer account with same company? 
Reagrds,

Hello,
A customer account can only be linked to one account determination group, but the ADGs can be driven by other parameters in some cases (e.g. the revenue account can be derived from the product/service instead of the customer). 
If you add more information on your use case, it will others provide guidance on how to achieve it.

Dear Colum Reilly,
You can use table NAST for the condition record creation date and time.
Please upvote the answers based on the usefulness.

Hi Radheshyam P.,
NAST gives the date and time of:
1. when the output was created on the invoice and
2. when the invoice was actually output

Hi All,We are trying to run opa5 test case in our pipeline using Karma runner with UI5 config but it doesn't work. Here we checked all the test case and they are running fine when we run them in parts or if they are run individually. Issue is when all the test cases are run together it gives error. When we run the tests in headless chrome browser we get Aw- Snap error.
Also when we run the test cases in git bash we get multiple errors which is never consistent. In some it looks like the issue is with the test cases but when running the test cases in chrome or individually the test cases run finely.

Possible reason could be we have many test cases(approx.120).
Any help is much appreciated.
Can anyone help me with JS rule to open a new page on selection of particular dropdown value?
I've requirement where user will select a particular value from dropdown or listpicker, and on basis of particular value a new page will open. (every dropdown should open a new page)
Working 1st time on SAP MDK. Any help would be appreciated.
Depending on how you want the flow to go, one option would be to use the OnValueChange event of the list picker to check what value is selected and then open a new page based on the selection.  This event fires when the list picker selection view is closed.  
So if you have the picker set to dismiss on selection (assuming a single selection picker) as soon as they tap on an item in the list the selection would close and it then the navigation to the new page would occur (triggered from the OnValueChange).
while iam searching PR in ME5A it doesnt displaying even though all indicators have been activated but for another user it showing.
Dear Naren, 
please check if ->
1) There are used same inputs in 
ME5A check box fields (assigned purchase requisitions, Also List Held 
PReqs etc.).
2) Different layout usage directly in ME5A (possibility of layout with default filter)
3) Default variants assigned to user (default user variant with a filter)
4) Check transaction SU53 after running ME5A to check for missing authorizations
5) Cross-check is missing PurReqs are not assigned to different plant or pur. organization

Hi everyone.

Is there any report transaction where I can get both the SO and its subsequent PO? I'm running on R/3 and I know about transactions VA05 and ME80FN. I would need something that somehow mixes both together.

Please consider that I have quite limited access to transactions, so I can't check for tables such as in transaction SE16.

Thank you
Try ALO1, this is a transaction from the archiving environment but it can be used for non-archived documents too.
check  ME2N/L/M report 
Have you looked at T-Code ME2K ?
Hi,

If you are asking about the third party POs you can also check the table VBFA .and subsequently you can also use the transaction ME2K .

Regards,
Hi,

You can also create querry by joining these tables to get the report of your own requirement.

 From my understanding the iFlow “Replicate Quote 2.0 from SAP CPQ to SAP S/4HANA Sales Order” does convert a CPQ Quote 2.0 into an S/4HANA Sales Order (not Solution Quotation)
 Link to iFlow: https://api.sap.com/integrationflow/ReplicateQuote20fromSAPCPQtoSAPS4HANASalesOrder

SAP CPQ - Quote 2.0 Integration with SAP Billing and Revenue Innovation Management:
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CPQ/a5de4dd4b8b047feb894c618aed793b9/df4810ddc9934cdab8d2bad5333e1a72.html

 The iFlow “Replicate Quote 2.0 from SAP CPQ to SAP S4HANA”) does convert a CPQ Quote 2.0 into an S/4HANA Solution Quotation but only works with BRIM and Event Mesh
 Link to iFlow: https://api.sap.com/integrationflow/Replicate_Quote_2.0_from_SAP_CPQ_to_SAP_S4HANA

How would you implement this integration? Adapt one of the above iFlows or develop an iFlow from scratch? Or is there a standard integration that I’ve missed? Do you know if there is a recommendation from SAP?
I would really appreciate the help of the community. Many thanks in advance.
Best regards

As of today, we don't have integration iflow as standard for Solution Quotation for S/4 Onprem.  Its better to ask SAP CPQ Support ticket and ask for the standard.  I know Integration package is been prepared and will come but not sure by when.  
The quantity is not show on batch number transaction report but in receipt from production with batch number assigned the problem is the quantity 6000 cannot remove. Is there a way to remove the quantity?

Hi SAP Support 
IMo there are 2 ways of looking at this 
1. for 'local' operational reporting, use the SAC embedded reporting inside the Ariba modules 
2. for 'strategic' enterprise reporting, use SAP Data Warehouse Cloud and SAP BTP Integration Suite for connectivity and semantics on top of Ariba suite. This is the sweet spot right now for Spend Analytics

Next month our facility will be rolling out Cycle counting with the RF guns. I was wondering if there is a way to create a 2D QR code data matrix for the Quarantine pallets that are multi-tag pallets. That way when we go to Cycle count them we can scan 1 code that registers multi-pallets in the RF gun. Is this possible?
Hello experts, 
We have created an extended version (Y15 "Actual at budget rates") to be able to do an fx simulation applying the Budget exchange rates to the actual figures.

Once we have created the new version using as reference the actual (standart) version, we wanted to introduce the exchange rates linked to the new category but the exchanges rates app in fiori does not allow us to select the version.


How can we inform the budget rates on the new extended version Y15 in the AVG and CLO rate types?
Thank you in advance.
Hi Fernando,
 
in any translation method, you can assign exchange rate (ER) indicator.   The ER indicator is assigned to a ER type. This assignment is dependent on the ER special version. You can maintain this assignment via T-Code CXD2.   For example, you can set Y15 as version in global settings and enter CXD2 and then you assign ER indicator C to ER type CLO1. Then you can maintain budget rates for ER type CLO1.

Hello,
in the CPQ configuration I see currency values in brackets after the attribute value in the attribute value list. Does anyone know where to adjust this?
thank you
Hi Thomas,Prices will be in quote currency and can come from any pricing logic you have implemented (can be CPS integration as well).There are two ways of controlling their visibility:
1. Global settings on tenant level:Setup -> General -> Application Parameters -> Configurator -> Show Attribute Prices within Configurator


2. Settings per attribute are as Yogananda Muthaiah already described are done on product Setup -> Product -> Attributes tab -> Additional Attribute Defintion section-> Toggle :Show One-time Price or Recurring Price

Hope this helps!Best regards,Luka
Thomas Scholtes
The currency value is displayed for Attribute in Product Configuration is coming from (Setup - Product - Attribute tab - Additional Attribute Defination having Show One-time Price or Recurring Price

Hello,
handing over a DTP Filter Value to the WHERE Clause of the select of an AMDP based Expertroutine - how does this work ?
This is the DTP Filter:

This is the Expertroutine AMDP :The Where-Clause of the Select of the AMDP expetroutine should take a parameter from the DTP Filter:

How does this work ?
Its SAP BW7.5.
ThanXs
Martin
The filter of the DTP is passed to the actual SQL statement as a PLACEHOLDER. For example if you filter on 0FISCYEAR = 2023, then the SQL statement will have a PLACEHOLDER with a filter set to this value.
Check this blog series:
https://blogs.sap.com/2016/06/17/hana-based-transformation-deep-dive/
especially the section for $$filter$$
This placeholder is used to filter the source data where possible. That means the placeholder is typically used in the next view above the union for all available source tables.
This placeholder contains the filters defined in the DTP extraction tab plus some technical filters based on the REQUEST or the DATAPAKID.
In case of using an ABAP routine or a BEx-Variable in the DTP filter, the result of both are used to create the filter condition.
The placeholder $$filter$$ is used for all BW objects except advanced DataStore-Objects (ADSO). To filter an ADSO see $$inbound_filter$$, $$change_log_filter$$ and $$nls_filter$$.
Hi,
the placeholder concept seems a weird, cryptic workarround concept and it seems, it doesent solve the problem to get the BW Parameter into the AMDP, 
also the seconde part of the problem of the transformation (to get the CALMONTh2 and the CALYEAR parameterized ) does not seem be solvable like this.
I am going for another solution.
Thank You !

Dear BO Experts,
I'm using 2 Publications (1 for DE Reports and 1 for FR Reports). 
When I schedule them, and tell them to deploy the reports in an SFTP folder, 1 of them succeeds and the other fails.
If I try to send them via mail, it works fine.
But when they should drop the reports in SFTP, it's like both arrive to the door of the SFTP and there is a fight between them. "Only 1 of us can drop stuff here"
Crazy...
Victor Torreblanca
It sounds like a permissions issue. If you're using a shared SFTP folder, make sure that both of the publications have the correct permissions to write to the folder. Additionally, check the logs to see if there are any errors that could be related to the issue. If the issue persists, you may need to contact your SFTP provider for further assistance.
Hello!
well, we have Webis and AfOs that have normal schedules that drop files in the same sftp folder.
The exact problem is when we combine:-Publication
-2 schedules
-Dynamic Recipients
-Destination SFTP (it works if destination were email)

As PoType is from TmaProductOffering, and Product in CartEntry is Product type, you need to tell hybris to get it from TmaProductOffering, or to "cast" it, I post a question before about it, you can see it from this link.
Anyway, for you question, your impex should be:
Hi Daniel,
Your header is trying to get poType from Product Type because of "product(potype(code,itemtype(code)))[alias=potype]".
It seems that potype is not there in product but it is in TmaProductOffering, hence you are getting the error. Note that product attribute in CartEntry is of type Product & not of type TmaProductOffering.
Hope this helps you in fixing the header.

Hello,
we want to synchronize the s3 media bucket from Production to the Test environments and we are thinking to use S3 Replication. However the DB will be synchronized twice at year though. Would that work?
Should the S3 bucket be in sync with the DB or it's not needed?
Thanks
When it comes to SAP commerce it is recommended to have DB and Media storage not diverging and more important anonymize production data.The problem which may occur is that the mediaPK for a new entry is already taken by a file on the storage. When this happens the creation of new media fails. It is not that problematic when the media storage is behind the DB then only some medias can not be loaded. 
Therefore SAP created a snapshot restore feature which takes this in consideration for CCv2. https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_COMMERCE_CLOUD_PUBLIC_CLOUD/0fa6bcf4736c46f78c248512391eb467/f777fc0a4c524e7aa20d84fc8a55b171.html
Hint: To avoid the collision during media creation it is possible to increase the counter of the mediaPK (this is not the PK of Media entity) to the current number of production database.
With your restriction (de-coupled media and db sync) I'd try the following:
0. Configure the S3 replication
Now media binary sync can be ignored for the next steps and only the state of the DB has to be taken in consideration. Problem is that the creation of media files will fail when dataPk is already taken.
1. Restore production DB Dump on test system (with all necessary anonymization)
2. Adapt dataPk counter by adding an offset (e.g. 10 million) to the current counter value.
3. Start sap commerce
Insights on dataPk
For the dataPk the same numberseries is used as for the Media PK itself. (Media Type Code = 30). The value in question can found with

Hi
We have recieved the CN and invoice and the same was posted using a dummy Gl bcoz the team thought the invoice and cn is 100% match. However. this is not the case bcoz the CN value is 185 usd higher then the invoice. And this 185 usd got clear with another invoice.
Now the issue is the dummy gl we used should always be 0 but bcoz of this case 185 usd is open in this GL. How should we clear this? Pls advise. 
Thanks
Hi
You could reset the clearing document using FBRA so that all items would be open again. Now you could perform clearing as you expect.

Hi,
We have implemented a workflow around Maintenance Notifications by copying the standard WS2000317 workflow template and adapting some of the tasks. 
The standard tasks (e.g. TS20000546 - Complete maintenance notification) use the old SWO1 Business Object method BUS2038->EDITASYNCHRONOUS, which launches transaction IQS2 in the WebGUI. Is there a way of specifying a Fiori app or navigation intent for the work item when using these type of Tasks? 
The work items will be launched from one of the Fiori Inbox apps, so I'm not asking if it's possible to launch a browser from SBWP; I would just like to open a UI5 app from the Fiori Inbox, rather than a WebGUI transaction. 
Many thanks,

Hi experts,
currently we have a complex SAP CAP CDS project based on Node.JS implemented using a SAP HANA cloud DB. For maintenance of various tables multiple UIs and processes are existing (depending on user role needs).
However, we now got a requirement that certain string based information must only be stored upper case in the database. Even after discussing with the customer the pros and esp. cons of having everything uppercase the customer still wants the requirement to be implemented.
We know, that we can convert the input either in UI before sending to the SAP CAP CDS service or within the service implementation itself.
Our question is: Is there a more easy way to ensure all data in a string based table field is only stored upper case - e.g. by some kind of annotation within the "datamodel.cds"?
(Unfortunately our customer is still referring to the old ABAP and R/3 world where you have a property on table level to store everything in uppercase only and they want sth like this now as well)
regards
René
Check if this helps: https://answers.sap.com/questions/13245085/converting-a-string-to-lowercase-in-custom-cds-vie.html
No, this does not help. First of all, the other post is referring to ABAP CDS views. But we have implemented SAP CAP CDS based on Node.JS. There are slight differences.
 Also, the referred help.sap.com link within this post is explaining SQL scripts for ABAP CDS views. When I try to adapt this to SAP CAP CDS this has no effect.
I also already tried to add an annotation "@Common.IsUpperCase: true" to datamodell.cds as well as app fiori cds and service cds with no effect.
Have you considered writing an event handler for the entities in question? With a before-handler you could convert all String values to upper case before inserting them to the DB. Alternatively, you could also write an after-handler that would convert all values read from the DB to uppercase before writing them to the server response. With the first approach you'd have persisted the data upper-cased. With the second approach you'd keep the data in the original version and only return it upper-cased. Read more about event the event handlers in our documentation.
This could be enforced at the database level using a BEFORE trigger: 
https://help.sap.com/docs/HANA_CLOUD_DATABASE/c1d3f60099654ecfb3fe36ac93c121bb/20d5a65575191014946db96aaedbef5b.html

Hello Gurus,
I added a label and input/output field to the screen in Screen Painter.
These components will be invisible to the user, but the input/output field will be filled from the outside (My Fiori app).
Hiding the label is not a problem (set the "Invisible" property to True), but there is a problem with the input/output field.
When I hide it, I cannot fill/populate it.
I have tried several options but without success:

Setting "Invisible" to True does not hide the field, but simply changes the content to an asterisk (*).
SCREEN-ACTIVE = '0' in the PBO hides the field but makes it unavailable for input.
SCREEN-INPUT = '0' the same behavior as in point #2.

I would be grateful for any useful hints/advice/feedback from your side.
Thanks
P.S. I'm not sure if that's the problem, but just in case, the label and input/output field name are the same: ZST_PAYSEND_ATTR-OUTSTD.
try the below settings.

I have an scenario named "Customer collect". In scenario, the customer takes care of the transportation logistics which means the customer "hire" a carrier and just let us know the name (SCAC Code).

2, how extract standard master data flow through ODP - ABAP CDS connection.
With these 3 points you should be able to identify the BI Content objects and flows for your scenario.

Does anyone have any idea about this? i hihgly appriciated you can share the information or manual about IRU.
Hi,
RU transactions are created when the database before Version 2007 is upgraded to Version 2007 or higher. When there are inconsistencies in the reconciliation before the upgrade, the system upon upgrade creates these RU entries to balance out/adjust the inconsistencies.
There are two types of RU which can be found which are with explanation, which gives the context as to what the entry is created against. The other is an 'Epsilon' which does not give the information.
You have to first check the Inconsistency Audit Trial Report under the Administrations Module > Utility tab.
To mention, the RU transaction cannot be canceled.

EXAMPLE: the total number holding English is 27, the total number holding Maths is 3, but the total number of students is 28, so the number holding BOTH is 27+3 - 28 = 2
For the TOTAL number of students I had thought the formula would be like this:=[Person].[Person Count] Where ([Person].[Certificate Type Description] In ("English", "Maths") And [Person].[Age Band]="14-17") but that returns the error "Missing object identifier in "'English"' at position 76 (IES 10069)If I use single quotes around English and Maths instead of double, it returns the error "The date or time format 'English' at position 76 is not valid (IES 10035)"
you need to use inlist function if you want to compare more than one record.
=[Person].[Person Count] Where ([Person].[Certificate Type Description] Inlist ("English";”Maths") And [Person].[Age Band]="14-17") 
Hi,
We are planning to upgrade our system from 1809 to 2208 in Second quarter of 2023. Can you please suggest if we can upgrade only Central Procurement component to 2308 later this year once it is available or complete S4 upgrade is required with all business Functions. 
As of now we use S4 hana for Master data and going to enable CP in 2208 release after upgrade. Other line of business are in different Boxes.
Hi Team,
In my Workforce Planning Model we have setup integration with Success Factor to get the Employee & Position related Salary and then we use it for Budget.
We have setup Data Action which Admin triggers it and data is sitting inside Actual Version. Then user goes ahead and runs the data action to copy from Actual Version into either Public version or their own Private version.
On 9th Dec 2022 I triggered the Data action to bring data from Success Factor which was sitting in Actual Version. User has then gone ahead and copied into his own Private version. He worked on the Budget and made changes in FTE and added some Dummy lines. 
So now there is requirement to trigger the data action again from Success Factor to bring in the latest employee information. Now if user triggers the Data Action to copy in his Private version it would overwrite the changes he did in his Private version.
So how should I make sure their Private version data would not get impacted and only new lines gets copied. Is it possible to have Delta Copy feature in Data Action? or any other option?
Hi Ravi,
I'm not 100% sure I understand the workflow and general solution design here (which makes suggested options somewhat difficult), but to your basic question, there is currently no native method of delta only handling for data action copy step. Ideally this requirement is accounted for somehow in the design by, for example, using a data source dimensions to track end-user updates vs source system data.
Cheers,Scott 
Hi Ravi,
I'd suggest you vote here for a delta calculation feature:https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/idea/266943
So, I made a Developer type by extending GenericItem with "name" and "uid" as attributes. Then, I created a new item with name=Nintendo EAD and uid=nintendo-ead but it's saved as "Developer[pk]" (see image below). 
Is there a way to change that? For example, Nintendo EAD[pk] instead of Developer[pk].
Thanks in advance!

add a label in yourbackofficeextension-backoffice-config.xml
This will change the main label, like this one (composed with its own attributes: code + ' - ' + description )

On our SAP S/4 HANA system, there were changes related to Finance which updated the FMBCS elements. These changes re-triggered the PO output messages for open POs and has updated as a new version in Ariba by Obsoleting the existing version. For these changed POs, suppliers need to create new Order Confirmation before proceeding with invoices. 
Is there an option or default transaction rule to turn-off Order Confirmation for re-triggered or changed POs. 
Hello Anuya,
Buyers can configure their account to retain order confirmation information on changed purchase orders with the rule Retain confirmation status of unchanged line items on change orders. 
You will want to check this Help Portal entry for more details: https://help.sap.com/docs/ARIBA_NETWORK/11ee0faf55c74bf49379485c2ca588a9/41340a47d0a3101487559b3d4853da41.html?locale=en-US 
To remove all requirements for a confirmation order, you would look to the default transaction rule: Require suppliers to fully confirm line items before fulfillment and then the transaction rule: Require suppliers to create an order confirmation before creating a ship notice in your account.
I hope that this is helpful!

I created a material (MM01) which is managed in SLED.
I would like when we receive the order (MIGO) that SAP blocks when we have not entered the expiry date.
Thanks
Hello David Robert
As per note 2190893 - Shelf Life Expiration fields not available in MIGO
The customising for the Expiration Date Check should to be set correctly against the relevant plant and the relevant movement type: SPRO -> SAP Reference IMG -> Materials Management -> Inventory Management and Physical Inventory -> Goods Receipt -> Set Expiration Date Check (transaction OMJ5). For the movement type, the 'Check SLExpDate' (KZMHD) setting needs to be set to '1 - Enter and Check' or '2 - Enter Only'.

Hi Everyone,
After I completed an inventory count, I decided to view my inventory balance as at that period and it was observed that there was a difference with what I counted and what I saw as the ending quantity at that period. For example, I did an inventory count of 500 and what I saw as my ending balance as of that period was 280.
What are the likely scenarios of this kind of issues and how are they resolved.
I await your swift response as usual
Thanks and Regards
Marcel
Hi Marcel
WH counted inventory is 500 but in SAP ByD system inventory end balances is 280. Correct my understanding from your examples.
In Physical inventory count there are possible scenarios of Approve count, Reject count and Recount. The difference will get recorded in your books and the approved inventory count will get updated as Physical inventory data. Example: If you enter 500 (Actual quantity) in physical inventory count and you are satisfied with count and approving the count. The impact will over-write from 280 quantities to 500 quantities. 
But this will not happened when you do reject count or re-count in Physical Inventory count tasks.
Might you know it, but sharing the standard document URL for your reference.

I am trying to debug a backend code written in Java. Previously, I could do remote debugging but now I am getting the error "app not found". Below is the command that I used for remote connection:
cf ssh myapp -c "app/META-INF/.sap_java_buildpack/sapjvm/bin/jvmmon" 
The error says:
App 'myapp' not found.
Could you check if the app 'myapp' is listed in the current space with 'cf apps'? Your cf client needs to be targeted to the corresponding space containing this app (check with 'cf target').

While creating the setting for MRP in tcode OMI8, system display above msg. Can anyone describe me that what are the parameters IDs that must be entered in SU3 for user authorization,
Thanks and Regards
Hello Shahzad,
check SU53. It should give you the required authorization object.
Best
Andreas
Hi Shahzad,
To resolve this issue, you will need to check the user's authorization roles and make sure that they include the appropriate authorization objects for maintaining parameters in T399D. You can also check the authorization objects associated with T399D by using the transaction SU24.
Once you have identified the necessary authorization objects, you can add them to the user's roles by using transaction code SU01 or SU10

Dear Experts,
Currently, in our CHINA environment, we have a complicated setup that allows YACN account codes to be output to output to public institutions by setting up and linking YACN account codes to YCOA's AlternativeAccount. 
However, One of our subsidiary in China seems to be submitting output to public institutions with YOCA account codes. 
(Q1) Do other customers in China use a YACN chart of account codes as we do?
Also, (Q2) is it necessary to submit YACN account codes to public authorities in China? Or is YOCA account acceptable as an account code to public authorities in China ?
Thank you for your quick reply in advance.KAZU
Dear all,
I had a typemiss.
Please read my question after replacing all YOCA with YCOA. 
Regards
Hi KAZU,
Good Day!
From our understanding, please refer to the following answers as reference:
(Q1) Do other customers in China use a YACN chart of account codes as we do?
A1: In S/4 HANA Cloud, YCOA is the default international accounting principle chart of account, but almost all Chinese customers will use YACN chart of account.
Also, (Q2) is it necessary to submit YACN account codes to public authorities in China? Or is YOCA account acceptable as an account code to public authorities in China ?
A2: From my understanding, it depends on the requirements of the tax bureau and the government.
I think it is necessary to submit YACN account codes to public authorities in China because YACN can traceable to local real account number to avoid audit problems.
You can double check with your onsite product expert.
Hope the answer can help you.

I need ABAP code on how to get the last three characters of a string.
For example, the string is 2008000
I need to get the last 3, which in this case happens to be 000.

thank you
len = strlen ( variable ) - 3.
last_three = variable+len(3).
hi,

DATA: LV_LEN TYPE I.
DATA : LV_LAST3(3) TYPE C.
DATA : LV_STRING(10) TYPE C.
LV_STRING = '576483738'.

LV_LEN = STRLEN( LV_STRING ).

LV_LEN = LV_LEN - 3.

LV_LAST3 = LV_STRING+LV_LEN(3).
WRITE LV_LAST3.

Or clearer:

Hi SAP专家，
 
业务场景如下：
我们存在最低的销售单价要求。如果销售订单的最终成交价格高于最低销售单价，则不需要审批销售订单。如果销售订单的最终成交价格低于最低销售单价，则需要审批销售订单。

 我们在系统中维护了销售价格主数据，在创建销售订单时，系统会自动显示销售价格，但是，如果手工修改销售订单的单价低于销售价格主数据时，系统不允许保存销售订单。这样无法达到上述业务场景要求。

 请问，有其他方案可参考吗？
Hi Rujia,
销售订单审批条件是可以通过 BAdI 来写逻辑的。
对于你提供的业务场景，建议尝试以下思路：
1. 将最低销售单价作为一个不可以更改的价格条件加入定价过程中，并为其分配一个小计值。
2. 为最终计算后的净单价分配一个小计值。
3. 在订单审批的 BAdI 里是可以读取到销售订单的小计值，做运算和判断，如果订单总的单价低于最低单价的小计值则分配订单审批原因。
具体内容可参考此篇 blog。

Hi SAP专家，
 
我们遇到以下的业务场景：
客户是基础化工行业。产成品P的原材料是原油。产成品P在生产过程中，会同时产出主产品中碳P01、联产品高碳CO-P02、联产品低碳CO-P03、副产品BY-F01、副产品BY-F02。由于不同批次的原油的碳含量不同，主产品、联产品、副产品的产出重量比例不固定。
 
A公司和B公司是两个独立法人实体。公司间交易的业务场景如下：
1）A公司对外采购原油；
2）A公司委托B公司加工产成品P，A公司向B公司提供原油。
3）A公司与B公司间存在委托加工合同，约定原油与产成品P（以高碳、中碳、低碳的合计重量）的产出比率、委托加工费。B公司按委托加工合同交付产成品P及副产品，公司间是以收货重量乘以不同加工单价进行加工费结算。
 
疑问：
1）ES的联产品、副产品的成本核算的核算逻辑是怎样？麻烦指教；
2）A公司与B公司的委托加工交易问题，在只有一张委托加工采购单的情况下，联产品、副产品在A公司如何收货、结算加工费？只需要在公司间的委托加工采购单录入主产品即可，还是需要同时把全部联产品、副产品录入？
Hi Ruijia,
1. ES中的联产品、副产品成本核算逻辑O基本一致. 如有具体问题，请提出，可以进一步讨论
2.可以参考以下下Scope item，就文字描述的需求给出建议不一定完善，需要实施顾问根据项目的具体情况给出解决方案。

Hi,
We are evaluating the financial closing solution and learnt that AFC is the strategic closing tool for SAP and looks promising. However, we are still looking for the answers to following questions and probably the experts in this community can help:
1. S/4 HANA financial closing cockpit exist in core but there wont be any innovation or roadmap to this product. Is there any guideline or information about how long SAP will provide support and maintenance for it. 
2. Is it possible to extend Org. hierarchy to Profit Center and Segment? If yes, can analytic apps/dashboard show or adapt the reports and KPI according to profit center/segment.
3. AFC is fairly a new product, how is the feedback and is there any public sector use case where AFC has been implemented or deployed on BTP platform.
4. Does SAP also provide AFC trail/Demo system like others - SAC, BTP etc
Br, Abhinay
Hello Abhinay, 
I am glad to know you are evaluating the AFC and thinking it is promising. Below please find the answer to your questions:
1. S/4 HANA financial closing cockpit exist in core but there wont be any innovation or roadmap to this product. Is there any guideline or information about how long SAP will provide support and maintenance for it.
Answer: SAP has no plan to deprecate the financial closing cockpit (FCC) yet, therefore it's maintenance period is the same as the period for the product FCC is located in. 
2. Is it possible to extend Org. hierarchy to Profit Center and Segment? If yes, can analytic apps/dashboard show or adapt the reports and KPI according to profit center/segment.
Answer: AFC right now supports controlling area, company code, and plant hierarchies. We are still collecting the requirements for the additional organization types therefore your input is very valuable for our enhancement consideration. Once we can support, for sure we will also support the analytics on these types of organization units. 
3. AFC is fairly a new product, how is the feedback and is there any public sector use case where AFC has been implemented or deployed on BTP platform.
Answer: There are many AFC customer implementations since the product release. For detail on reference customers, please contact your account executive. 
4. Does SAP also provide AFC trail/Demo system like others - SAC, BTP etc
Answer: Yes, we have a demo/test license, please also check with your account executive for detail. 
I hope my answer helps and looking forward to your further feedback on AFC.

Dear Experts,

The scenario is that we want to invoice 2 materials to the same customer but in 2 different currencies. Although it might sound little weird but it is our business requirement. So we created 2 Sales Orders in 2 different currencies for the same customer. But during invoicing we found that system is fetching currency in the invoice from the customer master and not from the preceding document.
I found few threads where experts are suggesting to user billing exit to copy currency from Sales Order and PO. But my question is why .. why to use billing exist for a std. behaviour. Just like billing document picks price from Sales Order or PO and not from VK11, similarly it shd pick currency also from the preceeding document. Preceding document shd have higher precedence over customer master.
Thanks.

now i want to view all park post cheque invoices date etc etc from PO orders that help to create me that PO issued in 12 JAN date their invoice park on 15 JAN post at 20 JAN date cheque issue at 29 JAN date.
sorry for grammer mistakes. 
Dear Yahya Saleem,
You can refer to tables: 
RBKP - Document Header: Invoice Receipt -> here you can find status (hold, parked, posted)
RSEG - Document Item: Incoming Invoice -> connection of invoice no. and PO
Easiest way would be to create query via SQVI.
You can accept answer if helpful.
thanks for the reply Stepan Kadera but these tables are perfect but its showing over all 1500 record which is 100 post and 1400 parked it is possible ?
in status column its showing Park Post and Delete nothing else but only 100 post its impossible

各专家们：
下午好。
我们在做汇票托收业务时，出现了如图中的报错。请问，是银行主数据有问题吗？应该如何检查如何解决呢？

您好，
根据您的截图显示，请您在app“管理银行账户”查看是否为house bank 10701维护账户ID“招商银行”。
根据标准设计，做托收时需要有托收银行以及对应的账户标识等信息。
希望如上回答可以帮助到您。

Hi Experts,
I am referring to to this blog post : https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/06/sap-papm-cloud-introduction-of-query-based-master-data-and-hierarchy/ for getting the master data from S/4 HANA system to PaPM Cloud. However my hierarchy have a range value at leaf level instead of a single value. Could you please suggest if there is way to implement this?
Hello, 
I have a requirement where I receive the RSA public key in base64 format from my external sender. Now I need to do the following thing -
1. Pad the original message using OAEP with SHA-1 hash function and MGF1 mask function.
2. Derive the modulus and public exponent from the RSA key and use it to further encrypt the message prepared from step 1. I get some hint from this blog https://blogs.sap.com/2021/04/13/rsa-encryption-in-abap/
I can somewhat able to do the step #2 in ABAP. But can you please suggest how to do the step #1 in ABAP? Is there any API available to do this. We have also SAP PO and SAP Integration Suite in our landscape. I am not sure if any of these system provides the padding and encryption feature out of the box or not.
Thanks,Mainak
Hi Mainak,
don't waste your time with first part of the blog. It was done more for fun than anything else.
 Just use CommonCryptoLib.

Hi Karthik,
You can get the ST22 like option using ABAP feed reader in Eclipse.
Go to menu bar then traverse for Window -> show view -> other -> ABAP->feed reader. 
Then select the project and add the feed query as 'ABAP runtime errors' that would list the runtime errors generated in the system based on the selection criteria.

Hello Everyone, I'm facing a problem while trying to publish a product in the API portal. I get an error message every time I try to publish my product. When I click on "Show Details" the error message shows an empty box with no information. I don't know what is missing. I made sure API Business Hub Enterprise is active and add myself to the AuthGroup.SelfService.Admin role group. Has anyone encounter this issue is there a way to fix it

Hi Barbara Obremska 
I got the same problem today and here is how I sovled it.
(not sure why SAP did not mention this in the product creation tutorial/documentation as one of the prerequisite)

After this, I refreshed the API portal and I was able to Publish the Product.(see status in above screenshot).
Now, when I opened the API Business Hub Enterprise again, I can see that the above product is publised there, for external consumption. (see below)

I hope this works for you too.

Hi again,
to complement the conversation above, here is some more information about developer onboarding in SAP BTP API Management, Dev Portal (new name: "API Business Hub Enterprise"):
Route A: Admin assigning the roles of the Developer directly within the Sub-account.
Route B: Developer Registers itself in the Developer Portal , no ApplicationDeveloper role added by Admin
Route C: Onboard Multiple Users as an Admin 
Hope this helps!
Sven
I was getting the same error and followed what Bharat Bajaj has mentioned . Immediately resolved the issue . 
Rahul . 
The error message should be fixed. It is just not done to have an error with no description. 
Thank you Barat for the clear instruction.
Thanks so much. Subscribing to API Business Hub Enterprise worked for me. I was able to publish product.

Why system generating Multiple DTR for single Freight order?we need solution
Hello Experts,
 Greetings.
 I want to create plant data and planning data separately using BAPI_MATERIAL_SAVEDATA.
 After creating plant data using BAPI_MATERIAL_SAVEDATA firstly, the corresponding plant's availcheck has been maintained proper value. however, when I create planning data without providing plant data, I get error message "The field MARC-MTVFP/BAPI_MARC-AVAILCHECK is defined as a required field; it does not contain an entry".
 But when I create planning data with plant data together, BAPI works fine.
 Does it means I have to create planning data with plant data together? BAPI would not read MARC from DB when I create planning data separately.
 Many thanks.
 
Best regards,
Felix ZHAO 
 
 
Hello felix zhao 
I'm not quite sure if I'm on the same page as you. What exactly do you mean by planning data? Do you mean MRP views 1 to 4?
If the fields of - what you refer to as - the planning data is part of table MARC, you cannot create the planning data and plants data separately. Also MRP data is plants data (MARC), thus, you also need to create the plants data.

Hi,

We will have a Custom Business Object containing a list of users that are to be added, depending on a Custom Field (Service Line) in the project.
We would like to implement this using Custom Logic but unsure which Extension Point should be used for this. The obvious one is /CPD/ENGMT_PROJ_SAVE.
However it seems the logic that can be implemented is very limited 

Can anyone recommend an Extension we could use for this, or suggest an alternative approach.

专家好，通过给物料增加“”09-批次的经常性质检”，可以实现物料触发质检后自动更新“下次质检时间”的功能，但是这里有一个时间线前后问题。
1. 比如物料1在T日到期，但T-1个月时就可以开始质检，若把物料状态变更为“待检” ，但此时物料1仍然是可用状态，允许领用的消耗的。
2. 类似的情况，在T-1月时变更为“待检”，若此时物料已经领用并消耗完毕，那QA放行数量操作和实际又不一样了。
上述两种情况有何应对处理的方式，谢谢。

Hi all, Facing the migration issue while connecting ODBC DSN 64 bit ,Build platform target x64,.Netframework 4.8
Setting the CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Xxxxxx all copy to local =false
Installed CR report for VS22 with sp33 and runtimes 32 bit, 64 bit.
Able to preview the report and using the 64 bit ODBC(SAP IQ) connection.
But failing to see report in the web page (Blank PDF) in the Web Application.
Hi Aj,
I don't think you can install both the VS 2019 installer and the VS 2022 installer. I never tried this because I'm using VS 2022 now, I still have VS 2019 installed and it still works, but I never tried editing a Report in VS 2019 so not sure it works.
I never asked our Developers when I was working there, I'm retired now....
I suggest uninstalling the VS 2019 EXE and the 64 bit runtime MSI, VS 2019 installer added it. And don't install the MSI's manually, the installer will do it for you if you click the OK at then end.
You will likely need to do a repair install of the VS 2022 installer after uninstalling the 32 bit version.
Once you do that then check the Interopt settings, when you build you may get the error, see my blog for more info:
https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/30/upgrading-a-visual-studio-2008-2019-.net-project-with-the-latest-cr-.net-sdk-packages/

I want to create a new catalog tile on the Ariba Guided Buying. Unfortunately, when I want to add a new tile using the catalog item option, I cannot find the item I want to add. Why this happen?
We store all our process documents in Sharepoint and link them into Signavio. But now we are changing our sharepoint name due to a divestment - which in theory means that one fine day all my links will fail together. 
We have a LOT of links. Does anyone know how I can programatically update all my links? 
Hi Susan,
Programmatically, this can be done using the SAP Signavio Process Manager API. There are different ways of doing it, depending on what data you want to ingest, either via workflow or python script.
Our SAP Signavio Services Consultants have done this for a few clients that I know of. 
If you need help with this and want to have a chat, please ask your SAP Signavio Account Executive to get you in touch with the relevant SAP Signavio Services team, and they will be more than happy to help you with this.
Hope this helps. Cheers. 
Susan Witton
Unfortunately, there is no single solution to this issue. Depending on your particular environment, you may need to develop custom scripts or programs to update the links in Signavio. Additionally, you could use a third-party tool or service to help with the migration, as some of these services specialize in such migrations. Ultimately, the best solution would depend on the specifics of your environment.

Hi Experts,

Who can advise how to resend inbound delivery LUW from ECC into EWM manually? 

Since I deleted one LUW queue of Inbound delivery which was failure status in EWM via SMQ2, then I found the inbound delivery cannot be changed or deleted in ECC. 

Thanks in advance!

Best regards,

Julia
Hi Julia 
Using VL60 you can achieve this.
In VL60 check your deli under vendor. Update any field like ASN NO or trip id.

Save .

System will re trigger the changes u will achieve the IDN in EWM.

hope to get result with this.

regards
Suraj
Hello Julia,

In my system, If I repeat output type, the inbound delivery get's re-distributed again. I would request you to repeat output type in Inbound Delivery in ECC first. you will be able to resend the inbound delivery. If it doesn't go, Try with VL60 to change the delivery information and save again. 

If it still doesn't go, Reject the IDN in EWM then recreate Inbound delivery in ECC again. 

Regards,
Sathish

Try this FM to redistribute the delivery

The execute exactly once contract of tRFC is implemented around the ARFCRSTATE table for incoming tRFC calls. That table decomposes the tId of your tRFC into ARFCIPID, ARFCPID, ARFCTIME and ARFCTIDCNT fields. That table also tracks the state of the tRFC execution. If a transaction with the same tId is attempted to be added to the table, the duplicate is detected and the new transaction is ignored. The entry persists until confirm tId is called by the client, or the maintenance job for the table cleans up obsolete transactions, which ever comes first (I belive by default the clean-up is after 1 day / 24 hours).
When using .NCo, either your call to commit is successful, then you do not have to worry about the eventual execution of the transaction (and you can call confirm tId anytime). Or that call is not successful, and you can safely repeat it. If the server had actually already received the transaction even though the call to NCo commit failed, a repeat call to the same prior to a confirm tId will not result in a duplicate transaction as the tId will be already there in the table.
nightly-monitoring-1.txtHi Experts,
I recently setup MSA database replication for a database of size 3.5 TB and started a process called EOD/nightly (almost 7000 jobs) and when we observe it segments of the primary database from admin who,sqm we see the data is accumulating in IBQ and not getting transferred to OBQ. Attached the details for you to advise.ASE and SRS : 15.7 SP135 on AIX 7.2 with logical page size as 8K.sqt_max_cache_size configured is 200 GB.stable device of 362 G
In the output of sqt of target databases we see negative values. Are they expected and what does they indicate? Also please let me know the ways to monitor the problematic areas.
Regards,Dilip Voora
Hello Dilip.
The end of mainstream maintenance for SAP ASE 15.7 was in 2020. There are a lot of performance improvements in more recent versions of SAP ASE 16.0 and SRS 16.0. 
Along with Ben's and Matthias' comments, you should also confirm that the AIX LPAR has been correctly configured for the resources required by the SRS.  
Ensure that there is a 1:1 mapping of OS threads to processor threads by setting AIXTHREAD_SCOPE=S in the shell environment that starts the SRS and that sufficient CPU and memory resources are available to the LPAR running SRS by confirming the number of VCPs vs. entitlement by running 'lparstat -i' and checking the output.
If data is accumulating, perhaps there are insufficient CPU resources available to process the queue.

Note this question is not about scripting or programming for SAP itself. The script needs to be able to discern a universally unique id/alias for the SAP System to which the host belongs. The form of this alias is up to me -it only needs to be reproducible, unique, and permanent. To clarify, if you were to setup a SAP System on some cloud VMs, and then on a different set of VMs: perfectly perform the exact same installation and configuration: those should 2 SAP Systems should have different aliases. Here are some important considerations:
- The script is going to run on every host on some regular schedule
- All machines in the SAP System should produce the same alias every scheduled execution
- VMs are going to be ephemeral and won't live past 30 days
- A single VM could host multiple distinct instances e.g. App Server + HANA
- If a VM is used by multiple SAP Systems side-by-side, then the script should be able to produce a list of unique aliases for all SAP Systems to which the VM belongs
- We are assuming that HANA high availability is being used
- We are assuming only linux hosts for now
- The script will run on VMs in one of the major cloud providers
- The first version of the script is assuming S4HANA only but will likely change
- The script will be able to run as the SAP user and so will have execute permissions on utility functions like sapcontrol, sapgenpse, etc
- It is unknown if the script will be able to execute arbitrary database queries with a tool like hdbsql
- I cannot assume that best practices were followed with host names/SID choice/etc
- The script will have read/write access to /usr/sap/**
Ideas I've had all revolve around the script recognizing it is performing its first scheduled execution and then try to store some data to some some shared location that only others in the SAP System will be able to access. Some of these ideas are:
- I think it is possible to create a PSE using sapgenpse that is stored in the database and pushed to all machines in the system when they come online. My script could hash this PSE and use the hash as unique identifier.
- Store a random string in a system level parameter store that app servers and DB servers have access to. I don't know of any such arbitrary data store like this.
If anyone has any ideas on how to achieve this I would really appreciate them. 
Thank you for your time.
We have one user that is getting the 404 Missing Page error (attached)inc0268926-1.jpg when launching WebI reports. No other users have this issue that I'm aware. At least myself and others I've checked with can launch the reports with no issue. Most questions I see around this issue relate to an upgrade. We haven't done an upgrade in a couple years. Is this just a web browser setting that can be changed for this user?
Is user opening the report through browsing reports folder or though report direct link?
Also, try checking it with a browser other than Edge.
Hi,
Can someone help me in understanding the KF disaggregation logic. 
Demand KF disaggregation method is equal distribution.
As per 1st table i entered demand at Product level and the demand is equally distributing among other customers.
In the second table, i removed the demand and entered at Customer C only and then again entered 100 demand at Product level. Now the whole demand is floating to Customer C only instead equal distribution.

Please enlighten me in understand this logic and your inputs are highly helpful.
Regards,
Divya
Hi Divya C,
The following Key Figure configuration defines how the values disaggregates:
Disaggregation Mode:
- Equal Distribution
- Copy Values
Proportionality:
- No Proportional Disaggregation
- Same Key Figure – Stored Values (this might be maintained in your case)
- Same Key Figure – Calculated Values
- Other Key Figure – Stored Values
- Other Key Figure – Calculated Values
- Disaggregation Expression
In your case the demand KF might have the proportionality field maintained as “Same KF – Stored Values”. The values of the key figure to be disaggregated are used as proportional factors. If the transaction just started and the key figure hasn't yet been changed, the value that is stored on the database is used. If the key figure value has already been changed and a new value for its available in the planning session, then this current value is used.
For more details on Disaggregation and Proportionality: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_INTEGRATED_BUSINESS_PLANNING/feae3cea3cc549aaa9d9de7d363a83e6/0b07724f3a62480fa695722c5103c339.html?q=Same%20Key%20Figure%20-%20Stored%20Values

Hi,
It copies the batch from the subcontracting PO component tab. so either it gets copied from PO or when creating an inbounded delivery, there is subcontracting tab where you can put batch number.
Regards,
Ravi.
Dear Experts,
We are on S4 Hana and have STO process configured along with SAP EWM. Whenever we are creating delivery against Sales Order, the person creating the delivery has the option to select the batch or over write the batch selected by the system from the option available on the screen. However this functionality is not available in VL10F where the batch is automatically determined by batch search strategy.
Our Requirement is that whenever fresh production is generated, we need to move this stock to our warehouse on other locations through VL10F and subsequent transportation. Thus user requires a provision to update the delivery document created against the STO. Since we are using EWM and delivery get distributed to EWM, User doesn't have the option to update the document using VL02N. 
Any suggestions on how to go about it As the user prefer that the batch selection should be in their control and they should do the batch search themselves manually.
Note: we do not intend to by-pass or completely terminate the batch search strategy currently being deployed on the remainder of the processes. 
Regards
Hi, Can you use LIFO - Last In First Out batch search strategy for STO Delivery (that's standard SAP)? STO Delivery creation is a background and once it's generated, it will distribute to EWM. It seems like you want S/4 users/buyers to overwrite that batch number. Another option is you have to put enhancement/BADI where you can change the delivery header status - VLSTK to "D" and then when they make changes, it will distribute to EWM.

Hi,
I am trying to run a Workflow on SAP intelligent robotic process automation desktop design studio. But I am getting the error saying scenario could not be started. I tried to activate the entitlement in my SAP HANA trial BTP cockpit but the subscription failed. My workflow can not run on standalone mode. Do I need to activate the Foundry or BTP for my workflow to execute in trial mode?
iRPA is now part of process automation. Meaning if you activate this today, you have to subscribe to sap build process automation. Not sure if it is available on trial account but it is for the free tier accounts.
Hi Onkar Mehakarkar,
As Wouter has already mentioned iRPA is now a part of process automation along with Workflow Management. It has already been announced that iRPA will be sunsetted in this blog. SAP Process Automation is available in BTP trial accounts, for instructions on adding to your BTP Cockpit see here. It's recommended also to migrate your desktop studio projects over to cloud studio following this guide. For further information on the general transitioning of SAP iRPA to Process Automation, view this Help portal page.
Side Note: SAP Process Automation has now been renamed SAP Build Process Automation because it's being packaged with other products like SAP Build Apps (originally AppGyver) and SAP Build Workzone, hence the name change in some documentations.

Hi,
I am having error while cancelling/revoking my invoice document (Conditions Invoice )in T-Code MR8M. User has created PO without check of "GR-Based Invoice Verif"and follow on documents (GRN-Condition invoices and material invoice) and then canceled GRN document (Mvt:102) despite having invoice documents (System let us do it because of missing check at PO level "GR-Based Invoice Verif") and then user try to delete material invoice documents and conditions invoice document but having error on conditions invoice only.
Please be noted that I have also checked OSS notes 501905 & 2143933 they are for ECC and previous version. The report Z_MRM_Delete_PP_1 does not exist.

Hi Experts 
I need to programmatically call an external parameterized service in my cap application.
External service url: 
/servicename/ABC(Key=‘123’)/Set
CAP service.cds file: 
entity Abc(Key:String(3)) as projection on ext.ABC;
CAP Node.js call: srv.run(SELECT.from(‘Abc(Key:’123’)’)); // tried passing in single quotes and template string both
This created a url like: dest.servicename/?$select=Key 
Note: The external service is made out of calc view with parameters
Kindly help. David Kunz Gregor Wolf 
Thanks
Kanika
Hi David Kunz 
Thanks for the reply!!Well, I wrote 'key' hypothetically to avoid using exact names as my service.
Passing with and without quotes around the value also, didnt work.Finally, I found the cqn way of passing which is finally making the correct URL '/ABC(Key=‘123’)/Set'.
Would be happy to try any other way of achieving the same :)
 SELECT: { from: { ref: [{ id: "Abc", where: [{ ref: ["key"] }, "=", { val: `${value}` }] }, "Set"] }, columns: [ { ref: ["*"] } ], where: [{ ref: ["fieldname"] }, "=", { val: `${value}` }], } };
Hi  Kanika Malhotra ,
"Key" is a reserved keyword, so it must be escaped and you don't need quotes around the value.
Best regards,David
There is a setting called VLS Synchronization Frequency under Global Application Settings which controls the frequency of the VLS Synchronization. Not finding any documentation on exactly what the VLS Synchronization process does nor what data is being synced. Any insights into this process would be appreciated.
Dan Howarth
VLS Synchronization is a process that synchronizes data between the SAP Learning Solution system and the Virtual Learning Server (VLS). Data that is synchronized includes, but is not limited to, user information, course information, and learning asset information. The frequency of the synchronization is configurable and can be set to occur every hour, day, week, or month.

Kindly help.

Dear All,
I am using analytic application for customizing report in terms of making a dropdown list with dimensions from query (live connection), however would like to see only 4 specified dimensions instead of all available in model.
I tried to modyfi code with getMembers instead of getDimensions, however still unsuccessful.
Thank you in advance for sharing any hints!
The code I use:
var dimension_list = Chart_1.getDataSource().getDimensions();
for ( var i=0; i < dimension_list.length; i++){
 Dropdown_1.addItem ( dimension_list[i].id, dimension_list[i].description );
}
Dropdown_1.setSelectedKey('[Model_Name].[parentId].&[Month]');
Hi there,
There are a few options you could use to achieve this. (i'm assuming the requirement is for the same dimensions to be used in the dropdown each time the dashboard is viewed - so these options are hardcoding specific dimensions)
Option 1: Manually Entering them in the dropdown widget  (best for performance as well)Using the sample model ' Best Run Juice'
If you select the dropdown widget you can manually enter the dimension ID and Text (Description in the dropdown)

You can grab the Dimension ID's and Descriptions using this code:console.log(Table_1.getDataSource().getDimensions());// I added it to a button so at runtime I can click it and show them all in the chrome console

Option 2 is via a script
As an example I added this script to a button, It grabs all the dimensions from the datasource, compares them to a manual list (dimensions =["Product" etcOnly those dimensions whose description is present in the manually created array will be added to the dropdown
Thank you James, works perfectly! Performance for 1 option is indeed better than 2 one. Thank you!

Hello Experts,
I am looking for supportive information.
I am using in my project variant configuration setup. In the pricing condition for PO instead of having a constant gross price, I have the price from the variant. Thus PO gross price is visible on the PO as 0.00 and with a "red" bullet. Is there any info for the standard SAP setup that explains why is like that? I couldn't find any solution to skip this the gross price read from my PO as it's mandatory. From my perspective and the process that I have, for now, don't see any issues later on in the process related to that. I can post and pay invoices and so on. I am only looking for confirmation if this is the current system behavior or if I should change smth.

Dears
in your opinion in which order should we migrate data to QAS client to get a good connection between the master recipe and the production version so they are auto identify to each other after migrating BOM and Resource 
1-Master Recipe then Production version or 
2-Production version then master recipe 
or it doesn't matter the problem is that after migration Production version and then master recipe everything looks good but the system needs you to go to every material and manually click just check button to see the task list is exist and give you the green color 
Hi Islam,
In my opinion, migrate the Production Version before the Master Recipe. This is because
when you create a Master Recipe, it references a specific Production Version. If the Production Version is not yet in the system, the Master Recipe cannot be created correctly. However, if the Production Version is already in the system, the Master Recipe can reference it and the required BOM and routing data can be automatically populated.

Hi,
Here is the scenario,
I want to have previous six months values in my current forecast months. For example, if I'm in Sept22 then I would need the values of Mar22 and if I'm in Oct 22 then I would need Apr22 values. Please refer below screenshot.

I know this can be achieved via data action but is there a way to achieve this calculation via calculated / restricted measures at story level? Anyone who has faced similar kind of issue or knows the workaround for this case. Their comments would be deeply appreciated. Thanks
Al Zaib Mohd
Not sure of your model type, Measure based or Account but you can try something like below. As you have not mentioned what should be the value if a month less than September is selected, I assume it should be 0.
Created 2 calculated Account members. Examples are based on Quantity measure. You can do the same with calculated Measure if the model is measure based.
Forecast: [d/CALMONTH] is my date dimension.
Forecast Qty: Just to check for month between Sep to Dec and use the previous measure
Output: 

If you wish for a reporting layout like you have shown, just create a calculated account with formula like below using above measures.
Output like your table shown:

Hope this helps !!

Hi, 
in e.g. cost center Plan/Actual App it is possible to select a cost center, but it is NOT possible to select a Cost center group. 
This is the most important selection-field for my users in existing ECC-System. We are now have a brown-field project from ECC to S4. 
In the old Report writer/painter reports we have the Cost Center Group as selection field, see screenshot:

In the Fiori app for cost center Plan/Actual i only can select the Cost center, but NO cost center groups, see screenshot.

Any idea for that ? Why is SAP so "stupid" and does not offer this important field in selection ? 
br Martin
First, you can check the app documentation in the SAP Fiori Library to see if it lists the required authorization objects for the app. To do this, go to the SAP Fiori Library (https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/index.html) and search for your app.
If the documentation does not list the authorization objects, you can try using the transaction code SU24 in your SAP system to see the authorization objects that are checked for the app. You can enter the transaction code in the SAP Easy Access Menu or in the command field of the SAP GUI.
Once you have opened the SU24 transaction, enter the name of the Fiori app in the Object field and click the Display button. This will show you a list of authorization objects that are checked by the app. You can click on each authorization object to see the details and check if it is relevant for your use case.
Please note that the authorization objects required for a Fiori app may vary depending on your specific implementation and configuration. It's important to work with your SAP administrator or security team to ensure that the required authorization objects are assigned to the appropriate users and roles.. 
Cost Center group reporting is avialable look below screenshot.: 

I would like to recommend this Fiori app to you. I took this screen shot from Version 2021.
Cost Centers - Plan/Actual 
F0949
By using su24 you can trace authorization object for related fiori app. 
Hi Experts,
In my MDK app, I have few old requests that had faced error when uploading last time. I am using sample Mobile service api ESPM service. 

I created a few new records through the app which are new 'CreateEntity' actions and then trying to sync. But the new records are not getting uploaded, only the old failed requests are being retried to the OData server.
I took a mobile network trace from MS cockpit and the trace contains only old requests but nit he new ones. Is it an expected behavior?
Best regards,

Generally speaking transactions are sent to the backend in the order created on the client.  So if there is a failure that would stop subsequent transactions from being sent.  You should fix or clear the error and then sync to continue processing.
We have the need to delete a team member via batch process. If a TM is a no show, we want to delete all records tied to this TM. Possible via batch? There a transaction or function module?

Hi experts,
I'm unable to see "My Employee File" from the dropdown menu after switching to my inactive assignment via the employment switcher.
There are only two selections made available after expanding the menu, namely 1. Home, and 2. Performance
Is there any way employee can access their inactive employment profile?
Hello,
The Employment Switcher is available in the profile of the user with multiple employments, but this feature is not yet fully functional. There is an ongoing enhancement being tracked in ECT-114530. This touches features of two modules (EC and Platform), hence, engineering is carefully planning the fix. This KBA will be updated accordingly as soon as ticket ECT-114530 provides timeline of the fix.

Hello, I have a lot of promotion, we have been creating promotions rules (and, consequently, drools rules) for 2 years without a stop. So, the system is overloaded. I am thinking about creating a Impex, to eliminate a lot of promotions that make no sense anymore. So the header I was thinking is: REMOVE PromotionSourceRule; code[unique=true] -> to eliminate Promotion Rules
and the header to eliminate the DroolsRules is not ready, because the code is not unique. I am thinking about using the PK. 
Has anyone tried this before? 
I tried it but it didn't work very well from memory. 
I ended writing a groovy script that archives all rules that have expired. I suppose you could modify this to delete after archiving. This will run on a cron every night.
there are out of the box cron jobs in the latest versions to remove the drools rules. its called droolsrulemaintainence job. also there are lot of recommendations given to take care of the promotions under Cx works area of sap.com. please do validate.
Hey Gurus,

Looking for the best practice in this situation. 

We are brining a new company onboard with SAP. They have one main office with two additional branches for storage and that crews work out of. 

Should we set the braches up as different plants within the new company or just treat the branches like different storage locations. From my reseach there is an arguement for both.

Thanks!
Ih two additional branches for storage and that crews work out of. 


New COmpany means what ? is it Company code.?

If yes and want valuation at new branches.

Answer : Yes yo should go for creation of Plant and storage location which has wider business prospective for future growth of org. / business.
Hi!

If you use different plants, you have the advantage that you can use stock transport orders to get material from one branch to another. 
You can run a normal MRP and need not to work with MRP in storage locations.
You may have also problems with the valuation of the materials when only using storage locations, because the planned delivery costs are normally different between one vendor and the different branches.

have fun.
Flo
Dear, 

Depends on what operations branches are going to perform. What costs branches consider for materials inventories, will be the same. Sales operations etc. 

But as you mentioned in simple - Storage location will be enough - but varies based on exact business process. 

Regards, 

Syed Hussain.

would recomend; one plant for the new company, different warehouses (both with there own storage locations) for each branch.

So plant XXXX
warehouse AXX storage location 1xxx
warehouse BXX storage location 2xxx

like you said there is an arguement for both but this way is best in my own personal opinion
Hi dear,
It totally depends on the business process that will be followed at two locations.If it is very clear that two locations would be used for storages then no harm to define them as storage locations under one plant.
If there are chaces of other business transactions also to take place from there then it is better to define them as a separate plant.
Hi
We are brining a new company onboard with SAP. They have one main office with two additional branches for storage and that crews work out of. 

 one main office -It will be plant

 two additional branches for storage  ,Is it manufacturing unit,They have any registration for excise or production,How far it from each other and from your production plant
If no manufaturing ,then create depo  or warehouse in sap 
If they are very near to production plant then create storage location

Hi, 
I have an issue, we have choose the availability check Z1 and works well in our sales order but in the delivery have a different scope, can we have different scope for sales order and for delivery in the same availability check? or can we have an availability check for sales order and a different av. check for delivery?
thank you for your time
Dear Cecilia Romero, 
There can be indeed different availability check logic for SO and delivery.
You can refer to transaction OMCP where you have to define checking rule for each availability check (group):

There you can see that SO (A) and delivery (B) are customized completely separately.
You can accept answer if helpful.
We have multiple materials that share the same GTINs due to our brand's requirements to maintain the same barcodes irrespective of the supplier. We would like to integrate EDI into SAP but how can we overcome this issue with the ZH32 table which matches the GTIN with the material if we need to add multiple materials with shared GTINs? Would the addition of matching our customer's product codes to our own materials in VD59 help? Could EDI operate on this one-to-one basis instead of the GTIN being the determining factor?
Hello Laura Hardy,
What could I understand you have Z-table in which you are maintaining materials with shared GTIN and also you are maintaining customer material with your material in VD51. If yes, it's suggested that please check the feasibility to enhance the transaction VD51/VD52 for GTIN field or you can maintain GTIN in any existing text field of VD51 to process your EDI instead of using Z-table. 
Also if some materials not maintained in VD51 and you want to process EDI for those materials then you can explore the field in material master in which you can maintain GTIN for processing. In material master there are some fields which are not usable, you can use those fields.
Think on it, it's suggestion.

Hi,
I have a requirement where we will get multiple cost centers from source and we need to map with new cost centers. We will get Old cost centers and New Cost centers from BTP Tables and created Hashmap Property through using Groovy Script Ex: CA1000012 = CA1000013,CA1000014 = CA1000026. How to Retrieve HashMap values in Message Mapping? Any one have Groovy Script that can be utilized in custom function inside message mapping?
You can absolutely do that. Instantiate a HashMap object from the property object and properly type cast it. There should be lot of examples on Groovy forums for this.
Dear,
If you have assigned the hasmap properly to any property then getProperty method will anyhow return object. So use below to get the value from HashMap.
Hi, our customer is using PMGM and has recently started a new performance cycle, so people have completed their 2022 Goal plans. However, not all goals on the 2022 goal plan are "completed", either because they have been "cancelled" or not met due to other reasons and wont be transfered to the 2023 goal plan. 
The customer wants to keep this information intact, as it is an accurate representation of the goal states in this point in time. 
Now, all those goals that have not yet been completed, show up in the Goal card on the Latest homepage. Dismissing the goals will only cause them to reappear withing 7 days. "Mark complete" is also not an option, since some of those goals won't be completed for the reasons above and this would lead to missleading information and it's cluttering the goal card with no longer relevant goals. 
SAP has provided the following conditions for the goal to disappear: Mark it complete, Delete the goal, or it will disappear after being more than 365 days overdue. None of these options sound good. 
Have there been any ways to work around this and provide a solution? Maybe with permissions to the goal plan? 
Thanks!

Hi experts
Is it possible to upgrade SAP_BASIS from 700 to 740 without an full EHP8 upgrade?
We have an old ECC 6 (NW700) system that requires certain components from 740. The obvious way is to do a full upgrade but that is time and energy intensive regarding regression testing.
Any documentation on how to do this?

You have to upgrade all the ECC components not an single component of Basis alone. It is inter linked with other components like ABAP, PI basis, BW, etc.

We are facing the exact same issue, and also need to upgrade SAP_BASIS (plus other dependend components) from 7.00 to 7.40. What notes and guides did you end up using for this? What does the upgrade process look like? Thanks!
We added a new question to our job application template. When the candidate applies, they see the new question and can answer it, however when the hiring manager or recruiter open that applicants profile, the new question and answer are not visible. What am I missing? 
Found it ... I had to edit the Field Permissions within the application template to enable the Recruiter and Hiring Manager to see that new question. 
I have a weird issue. Code change has been done to an existing RFC enabled function module(Custom) and migrated to QA. 
When executed from SE37 or via Program, the correct version(recent) is being called. However while calling from Third party, still old version is being executed. This was confirmed by having an external breakpoint. 
I can see the code in the debugger but cursor behaving similar to the older version. 
I had seen this issue within clients but get resolved after sometime. But not in QA. It is more than 2 days but still issue persist. Created a new transport and migrated. But issue still persists. 
Any suggestions? 
I am not RFC expert, but could it be that Third party has still opened one old RFC session / connection?
Check this ABAP help document:
https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenrfc_context.htm
By calling FM RFC_CONNECTION_CLOSE you might be able to close old session and Third party will (hopefuly) call latest RFC module version?
Hi,
It can be that the metadata cache of the third-party application is not refreshed, which could cause such issues. See SAP Note 1479970 Changes in RFC modules are not reflected in Java Server.
Hi,
I need to connect/group/define some kind of relation between different items in SAP. Consider 3 different groups consisting of many items for 3 different purposes. And I will select one from each group and define a relation between these 3 items. It is required mainly for reporting. Any comment?
Thanks in advance.

Hi,I'm really looking forward to the merging of story and application in the New Optimized Story Experience. Unfortunately, I'm not a Fast Track customer, so I won't have the opportunity to test until May 2023.I have a question in case of current restrictions in Analytic Applcations when using Optimized View Mode. 

I am currently not switching my Analytic Applcations to Optimized View Mode, because the following things I use don't work at the moment:

Blending
Time Range filtering on tables
Input Control API - setSelectedMembers()
getNumberFormat()

Will these things be possible in the New Optimized Story Experience?

Dear Community,
I am using SAC Planning Functionalities for Data Entry purposes.
However, for some German locations, SAC is doing some very strange conversions..
Example:
I want to enter 610500,256 and it calculates the figures like that:

It does not consider my commas or dots...

It is showing it as 610.500.256

Hi, I'm building an integration with SAP Service Cloud. My server application is going to use OData API to access SAP resources. I would like to use OAuth 2.0 to authenticate my clients with SAP in order to get an access token to communicate with API on their behalf. Access token should also be refreshed regularly without client intervention. 
I'm new to SAP ecosystem and struggling to figure out how to configure OAuth 2.0 for the scenario above. I only have SAP Service Cloud account. While reading help article https://help.sap.com/viewer/ea72206b834e4ace9cd834feed6c0e09/Cloud/en-US/ba893b5161d34760989429c24b28f25b.html I've got an impression that I should also have an SAP Cloud Platform account where I will register my server application to be able to authenticate and communicate with API on client's behalf. 
Could you please confirm my assumption? Is it possible to implement OAuth 2.0 flow with SAP Service Cloud account only? 
Thank you!
It seems that OData API doesn't support classic OAuth 2.0 flow: https://github.com/SAP/C4CODATAAPIDEVGUIDE#authentication
As an alternative I'm going to use 'OAuth SAML bearer flow'. For that I need to request a token from C4C platform.
Hello,
Based on my experience, C4C prefers Basic as well as Client Certificate-based authentication and for these, you do not need any explicit configuration for trust establishment.
In case you want to authenticate your client with an OAuth 2.0 flow for C4C OData communication then you need to have an OAuth Identity provider who can authenticate the incoming user. By standard SAP provides OAuth mechanism via SCP hence following article talks about the same:
https://help.sap.com/viewer/ea72206b834e4ace9cd834feed6c0e09/Cloud/en-US/929294823bc44614ba2034662f043793.html --> For Neo

However they are not just restrcited to this but you can use any other OAuth Identity Provider as well like Okta or MS ADFS but the procedure for et will remain the same i.e. register a OAuth server for authentication and register OAuth Client for OData Access,
Hi Experts,
While creating idocs for the same system, IDocs are created in the process state. if I go through the IDocs, Outbox has been successfully completed, but Inbox has not been completed.If I went to SM58, those IDocs are reflected there, with the following statuses: "Transaction Excuted," "Transaction Executing," and "Name or password is incorrect."
I didn't find where the actual mistake was.

Dear Experts,
We are getting an issue in Flexible upload of Reported Data while trying to load data using the Data monitor app in Group Reporting in Fiori.
The error as shown below:"Mandatory parameter fiscalyear missing." & "Value PERIODICAL is not allowed for setting PERIODICAL" & 
"Value 0 is not allowed for setting DOCTY"
We have followed below steps for your reference:
1) Referred the flexible upload template mentioned in note ‘2659672’ and tried to upload it but still getting error Like "No Data was read" if upload in Excel CSV format and SRD1 method
2) Referred the Help Portal and followed the mentioned parameter (https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/4ebf1502064b406c964b0911adfb3f01/03caba7eac06470ebfd8fd769f5e2e19.html?) like *parameters, Periodical, Update mode, NSEP etc and accordingly prepared the file and upload in CSV file format and SRD1 method but error got same " No Data was read"
3) Since we are using 2021 version tried with and without Ledger and Version concept as well (after 2020 following version concept) but getting error.
4) Referred the similar related Q&A in SAP Community (Group reporting community), like checking the Semicolon (;), Row Type Indicator set as "Use", Feild separate (;) and T (Tabular) option in upload method as well but still getting to loading error,
5) Tried with different fiscal year like 2016 and later 2020 but getting error upload in Excel with CSV format (Error:No Data was read) and TXT format (Error: Mandatory parameter Fiscal year missing)
6) Tried with both upload method SRD2 and SRD1 in Excel format (CSV file).
7) We tried with one of the Sampel Template which provided in Q&A of SAP community but still end up with error. (https://answers.sap.com/questions/13597476/group-reporting-flexible-upload-issue.html)10-used-sap-community-txt-format-for-testing-as-we.jpg11-upload-txt-file-fy-2020-srd1-used-sap-community.jpg12-upload-steps-fy-2020-in-srd1-txt-format-used-sa.jpg13-upload-method-details-fy-2020-used-sap-communit.jpg14-task-log-details-fy-2020-srd1-txt-format-used-s.jpg15-error-screen-shot-fy-2020-srd1-txt-format-used.jpg

Getting Below Errors

Hi Srinivasa,
A lot of information has been provided and you are referring and doing everything right. Unless somebody sees it, people will make guess only on such question.
Small thing, please ensure that you are setting 'Global Parameter' with the period and year that you want in your upload. Also ensure period is open in 'Data Monitor' App.
Regards
Shakeel
Hello Srinivas, 
please check the attached format and try to load it. ( CSV file)
Just make sure that the document type "00". and choose the format SRD2

Hi Shakeel,
Thanks for your suggestion. 
Yes, these are small things are important as I got to know when I was referring other Q&A SAP community. Hence, I have been aware and followed all these small things should not ignored.
I have followed the period open process for all my tastings and I about to attach that screen shot as well but due to size limit I couldn't be able to attach. 
The Main Issue I'm looking here, If the Tabular format upload, system saying, "No Data Was Read" and If the same data converted in to Text format and upload, system reading and throwing above errors. what was missing in Tabular format?
And how to fix the errors in TEXT format, which was showing Fiscal year missing. This fiscal year filed mentioned in the format and i have filled as well, apart from this where I needd to mentioned or what was missing?

Hello,
Crystal 11 had no concept of Windows 11, lots of change made by Microsoft which caused this to happen.
I suggest upgrading to Crystal Reports 2020 to be supported on Windows 11, you can upgrade from the Start screen of go here:
https://www.sapstore.com/solutions/99043/SAP-Crystal-Reports
Also note, you MUST upgrade your reports to Version 2020 also, simply open them, Refresh the Report, click on File, Print and select the printer and Click on Apply, don't print, now save the report, Cr will now use the saved printer info in the report when printing.
Don't use No Printer, but if you do you also MUST check on Dissociate option.

Hi to everybody,
I've encountered a problem with Crystal 2022 patch 4 (14.3.2. 4272 but also the previous patch): it's no more available the function to divide (cut) a section. In CR 2020 (and all previous version), it was possible to split a section directly by pointing the cursor (left click) in the left side ruler dragging up and down the cursor to the point of the cut.
This "bug" is very annoying because there is no any other possibility to cut/divide and resize a section.
Please, any idea?
Thank you in advance.

Hi Dausto,
I asked our Developer to have a look at this and he confirmed it is a bug.
Someone in the Support Team will create a KBA and escalate the issue to R&D for a fix in a future patch for CR.
Have a great day

I'm creating a report on VB.net 2022, MySQL and proper Crystal report version. The report wizard working well. the problem arise when I run the form that contained the crystal report viewer, it shows the error below:
An error occurred creating the form. See Exception.InnerException for details. The error is: The type initializer for 'CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine.ReportDocument' threw an exception.
is it a bug on crystal report or what? please help me to solve this issue. thank you.
Go to the properties of each of the Crystal references and make sure that "Embed Interop Types" is set to False.

When you compile your app some CR assemblies may still need Interopt enabled, most do not as Dell noted.
See my Blog on upgrading for more info:

I have done a number of webchats and no one can answerI have emailed and noone repliesplease help and advise me as i have been trying for 2 months to deploy my software with no idea on license/costs
Hi Paul,
Unless you get an OEM support contract they won't pay much attention to you, go here to get to the real people, mayby, ask for OEM sales.
https://support.sap.com/en/index.html
Click the Chat window.
To become and OEM partner you need to sell a lot though.
For Cr for VS go to my WIKI page:
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/Crystal+Reports%2C+Developer+for+Visual+Studio+Downloads
On that page is a link to the Licensing Info.
Crystal Reports for Visual Studio Licensing (updated)
Quick answer is for every user who logs into your app you/they need to purchase Crystal Reports Designer per deployment, this is where an OEM Partner is a better deal, you get discounts etc.
You can purchase bulk licenses also, though OEM Sales partner.
To get CR Designer 2016 or 64 bit 2020 go here:
https://www.sapstore.com/solutions/99043/SAP-Crystal-Reports
Good luck
Don
Hi Paul,
I've been informed there is no OEM contracts available for CR for VS any more so you'll have to follow the the Licensing info and single purchase a copy of Crystal Reports per deployment.
Have a great day

Hello Experts, 
Is there any BAPI available for MP30 forecast execute function? If i understood correctly with BAPI BAPI_MATERIAL_SAVEREPLICA one can update the forecast value. But is there any BAPI/FM that will the trigger the same function 'Execute' as in MP30 
Hello
I don't think we have a BAPI to run the forecast, but you can create your own FM to submit program RMPROG00.
Regards,Caetano
Dear P D,
I think you do not need BAPI for executing total forecast calculation.
You can refer to standard transaction -> MPBT

Hello Experts!
1) I run balance carry forward task thru consolidation monitor and I see:
FS-ITEM 101010 - SUBITEM 900 - PERIOD 2023.000 - USD 1000 (which is perfect).
2) Then, I did flexible upload of an external consolidation unit for 2023.001. as follows:
Parameter PERIODICAL BLANK (FOR YTD DATA IN FILE)
FS-ITEM 101010 - SUBITEM 915 - PERIOD 2023.001 - USD 1765 <--- YTD value
I want the balance for 2023.001 to be equal to USD 1765.00, so I expect that GR loads just the difference of USD 765.
3) When I run Group Data Analysis Report my surprise:
GR did not consider the beginning balance of USD 1000 already loaded as part to calculate the final balance; instead it loaded the entire USD 1765, summarizing a final balance of USD 2765.
I do understand that this happens because I have two subitems here: 900 (beginning balance) and 915 (variant).
But my question is:
Shouldn't GR have considered EVERYTHING (independent of the subItem) to calculate the correct movement value to be loaded into the subItem 915?
Am I missing something?
PS: This is not happening to S4H consolidation units! It happens only for external units loaded thru csv file.
Thanks a lot for the help
Jadir Mendes
Hi Jadir,your understanding is correct and there is following roadmap item which will allow identification of dimensions and dimension values as a total - https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?BC=6EAE8B27FCC11ED892E919ED096400CC⦥=FIRST-LAST#;INNO=000D3AAC9DD21EECBCF2EF70A3597520Please be aware that in case of No Posting/Entry settings of Subitem there is an exception when there is no data existing for the consolidation unit in any preceding periods of the fiscal year and then opening balances can be changed.Kind regards,Tomas
I think that's why it doesn't work:
For example, subitem 900 (Opening balance) is set to No Posting/Entry. For consolidation units that have opening balances carried forward from the previous fiscal year, if you upload a file that has the input type Cumulative and update mode Delete all, the exact existing values in the system need to be included in the file on subitem 900.
So, I understand that, for EXTERNAL COMPANIES, as long as I will execute balance carry forward task, I need to upload files with PERIODIC data.
Am I right?
Hi Jadir, 
Do you specify any movements at all in your source file or is 915 more or less a place holder for all movements?
The system expacts that you deliver the ytd movement, but that still does not include the opening balance. (and for Januari the YTD movement will always be equal to the periodical movement).
I would double check wheather it is possible to exclude the openingbalance in the export from the source system. 
Hello all,
Thanks for the replies.
Customer decided to continue with BCF for all companies and they will upload PERIODIC data for the external ones.
Thanks again!

Does anyone have a step-by-step guide (or can guide me) to configure Phase Control Codes in the 9 phase Reactive Maintenance orders? Thanks Gurus
Hi Maria,
I would read these two pages first to understand the concept:
Phase Control Codes
FAQs - Phase Control Codes
In the FAQ link above, there is an example of blocking a phase (Ready to Schedule) based on a permit-to-work process (no permit has been issued yet).
If this is insufficient, reply back with what you are trying to actually achieve. eg: What phase you are trying to block based on what context.

We are trying to build a workflow based on the Person Responsible of the PM Work Center. How do we assign a Person Responsible in S4H Public cloud as there is no integration with HRMS and we cannot assign Personnel Numbers to the Work Center. 
Hi Maria,
What type of workflow are you trying to create?
It all ties into the 'teams/responsibility management' concept now.
1. You use the app 'Manage Teams and Responsibilities' to create a team for each Work Center (I just did 1:1 relationship)
2. In the team you can link the PM work center
3. In the team you can add business partners.
You can define different 'functions' such as a team lead / team owner which could be sufficient for a person responsible.
This structure can then be used for processes such as the Maintenance Order approval workflow, or filtering on technicians in the work centers for dispatching in the scheduling apps.
I would review this link for more info on how to setup if this is what you are looking for: Setting up a Work Center Team

Hi,
some list are of type "unsorted" and can not be sorted, even in the GUI.
I now the pain very well and I am asking this for ages but it will most likely not come.
BR
Volker
Hi,
go to Model - Attributes. There you can sort attributes alphabetically by Name, by Code or by any other string based property. You can sort it even by entities owning the attributes. You can filter the list too.
If you don`t want to alter default list of Attributes or you simply need more types of view (different sorting, different filtering,...), you can create multiple List reports. Go to Reports - List report wizard. Here you can sort, filter, add or remove individual properties. You can have multiple List reports with different settings. And these List reports are live, so when you add some attributes they automatically become part of all your list reports (depending on your filtering, of course). And you can even create snapshots for certain points in time and access them anytime later.

Roberto Sayo
Hi,

One option is to change the depreciation key in Asset Master to MANU - Manual Depreciation. Depreciation is managed manually. Or setting to 0000 should also be ok.

Hi, 
just activating the shut down indicator will not do, you have to change the depreciation key also to allow shut down, this is the last field on depreciation key screen,hope this helps
Hi,

No depreciation for a period of time 
If you have an asset which would not be used for production purposes for next six months as the plant is being closed. 
Therefore you don't want to retire the asset and neither do you want depreciation to be carried out during these six months period. 
Once the plant is opened, from then on, you want to execute the depreciation run. 
You can utilize the Asset Shutdown feature on the Time-dependent tab of the asset master record. 
Select the Asset Shutdown checkbox - create a time interval - Save. 
If you cannot find the checkbox, it could be hidden :- 
In AS02 click Environment -> Screen Layout -> Master data 
Select the Screen Layout and click Logical Field groups 
Select 3 - Time-dependent and click Field group rules 
Tick Opt, Mnno and Sbno - Save 

Optionally, 

you can set the Depreciation key in the Deprecation Area Tab. 
You can also change the depreciation key to '0000' (No depreciation and no interest) for each of your depreciation books. Just make sure you have run depreciation up through the current month before doing so. When you are ready to put the asset back into service, reset the keys to their original values. The system will calculate no depreciation during the months where you have the key set to '0000'.
Hi, I think that using 0000 depreciation key will works correctly

Hi,

Good evening and greetings,

Please go through the following SAP OSS Note

Note 454989 - Shutdown not considered with depreciation calculation
Note 584648 - The 'Shutdown' indicator and asset in last year of UL

Please reward points if found useful

Thanking you,

With kindest regards

Hi Robert

The best way is to block the asset.  AS05 transaction.

Thanks

C_S4HDEV1909: SAP Certified Development Associate - Programming in SAP S/4HANA, for SAP NetWeaver ABAP Programmer.
The certification C_S4HDEV1909 says that it is an "Associate level" certification which means that, it is for fresher.
1. Please correct me if I am wrong and
2. can a fresher directly go for certification C_S4HDEV1909 without learning ABAP ?
Thank You.
Hello KIRAN KUMAR
As per the description of C_S4HDEV1909 SAP Certified Development Associate - Programming in SAP S/4HANA, for SAP NetWeaver ABAP Programmer
The "SAP Certified Development Associate - Programming in SAP S/4HANA, for SAP NetWeaver ABAP Programmers" certification exam verifies that the candidate has the knowledge required in the area of Programming in SAP S/4HANA. This certificate builds on SAP NetWeaver ABAP programming skills and experience that is then refined by practical experience during several projects. This exam validates that the candidate possesses foundational knowledge in the area of SAP S/4HANA ABAP Development
So if a fresher, without ABAP knowledge passes this exam, that would defy the whole certification purpose.

Hi to all. I would like to know if there is some standard t-code on SAP GRC Nota Fiscal that call the NF-e webdynpro monitor program (/xnfe/nfe_outb_monitor).
Thanks best regards.
Hi Marcelo, I hope you are doing fine.
Is the access via the User menu (GRC) -> Message Monitor -> Monitor Outbound NF-es/Events -> NF-e Monitor what you are looking for or do you really need a t-code?

Hello Experts,

I have the following scenario for one of my clients. So far, one IM storage location (0110) EWM managed. One storage type 5000 (multiple storage bins) representing the warehouse, and another storage type 0050 (fixed bin with sometimes several fixed bins per material) representing the shopfloor where there are some racks…. Generally, items are mainly stored in fixed bins in the shopfloor, and in case of overflow the same item can be stored in the warehouse as well. In the warehouse can be stored low turnover items as well. My customer would like to automatically trigger the components staging from the warehouse (storage type 5000) to the work center and backflush the quantity in the PSA, and automatically backflush in fixed bin for components stored in storage type 0050 (supermarket). I might use PMR functionality. Any idea to cover that business requirement? For me we have to stage components to the PSA in both cases. 
Thanks for your feedback

Hi all,
I saw in this KBA: https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3072236 that when submitting a data capture form, “Authentication process also checks for fields already completed by existing candidate. Candidate can only view fields not already completed”. Does this mean that if existing candidates apply to the form part of the data they fill in (if already present in their profile) is not saved in their profile? Isn’t the information placed in the form by candidates used to update their profile, even if data is already present?
I opened a ticket to the support two years ago and they said that they knew about this issue but they had no ETA for the fix. Do you know if things changed in the meanwhile?
Many thanks in advance,

Dear all, 
Being in S4/Hana Public Cloud, we need to make it possible for a German private Company to send e-invoices (O2C) to different customers (public or non public...) with XRechnung.
My understanding is that we have to activate PEPPOL in SAP S4Hana Public Cloud and that it requires the following prerequisites before we can start specific configurations and mappings*... Is this check list correct ?

First : we understood that scope item 5XU must be activated (1J2 is not enough).

Then , check list of actions to be processed :
A. prerequisites : 
0- I understand that we need to subscribe to Peppol Exchange Service for the Cloud Edition of SAP Document and Reporting Compliance by getting in touch with your SAP representative for further details (then we'll receive different emails...)
1- Create additionnal users : https://help.sap.com/docs/DC_PEPPOL/18b7404616704ee5a71ca373418fc4bf/b09412d672f8423fa04590602ea92cd7.html?locale=en-US
2- connect the service to the back end system : https://help.sap.com/docs/DC_PEPPOL/18b7404616704ee5a71ca373418fc4bf/8b906172650c4872a849a4b30577d983.html?locale=en-US
3- Enable your company to send and receive electronic documents : You register your company in the Peppol network (is it point 0 ?) and are ready to send and/or receive electronic documents from your business partners. See Enabling Your Company to Send Electronic Documents in the Peppol Network and Enabling Your Company to Receive Electronic Documents in the Peppol Network.
4- Configuring Custom Identity Provider (IDP) and Using Own User Base : https://help.sap.com/docs/DC_PEPPOL/18b7404616704ee5a71ca373418fc4bf/f6142c71c1874270aabab446981acf5c.html?locale=en-US
Then proceed to Integration : it looks a little bit like the previous prerequisite points but my understanding is that the following points are different andd also need to be done. Am I correct ?
B. Intergration : 

Creating Communication UsersYou create communication users required for establishing communication between SAP S/4HANA Cloud and Peppol Exchange. To be able to exchange data, the two systems must authenticate themselves.
Creating Communication SystemsYou create communication systems required for establishing communication between SAP S/4HANA Cloud and Peppol Exchange for the Document Compliance Peppol Integration (SAP_COM_0529) integration scenario.
Creating Communication ArrangementsYou create communication systems required for establishing communication between this system and Peppol Exchange.
Configure Connections to Service for SAP S/4HANA CloudYou use the Connection Management app, to define the configurations required for S/4HANA Cloud to connect to the service.
Connect Service to SAP S/4HANA CloudYou use the Connection Management app to define the configurations required for your service to connect to SAP S/4HANA Cloud system.
Download Service CertificateYou download a certificate from the Connection Management app. This certificate is required for the creation of a communication user in SAP S/4HANA Cloud

C.- Then, for memory, the finalization would be done in the following steps / Germany : 
- Configuration Options for Key Users – referring to doc types mapping to edoc, ID types for business partner, etc. 
- Configuring Value Mapping for fields in XML 
- Master data – maintain the party ID’s in company code, customers, suppliers 
details : https://help.sap.com/docs/DC_PEPPOL/18b7404616704ee5a71ca373418fc4bf/e21093a94e934531949cc48029b9ec1e.html?locale=en-US
global view : https://help.sap.com/docs/DC_PEPPOL/18b7404616704ee5a71ca373418fc4bf/9925b6f3fefd421c9cc0fca47ce5ba43.html?locale=en-US
D. And then, as we want to use XRechnung, we should also : https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/e2d057b7b4df44ba941a040d4dda2956/d7b504827698421189ca346341dc1f8e.html?locale=en-US&q=xrechnung

 For each business partner you want to send electronic documents by e-mail, you've chosen the E-Mail Process with XML option in Assigning Party ID Types to Business Partners (Mandatory).
 You've integrated Peppol Exchange and done the onboarding activities. Check Integrating with SAP S/4HANA Cloud. (done in previsous steps...)
 For each business partner you want to send invoices by e-mail (XML), you've maintained their e-mail addresses in master data. Check Maintaining E-Mail Addresses of Customers.
 If you use the process described in this topic along with another process, then you've registered factory classes to generate additional electronic document instances. Check Activating Additional eDocument Instance Creation (Recommended).

Thanks for your understanding, there are so much documentation that I need to realize a check list !
Kind regards,
Guillaume

 Hello Junaid ALAM, can you help ? 
Thanks  Owen Liu 
But I think I'have alreaduy read all this and made a check list from it and from other documents again. But there are so many documents, and sometimes the fomulation is different so it is not obvious to say if the subject is indeed or if it is only the formulation that is different... Anyway this is the reason why I had this check list done and wished you could confirm confirm.

SAP专家老师：
下午好，SAP专家老师们，我公司有S价自产半成品，下阶物料全是V价外购材料，由于业务需要，公司在2023年不在生产该S价自产半成品，且下阶V价物料的采购信息记录价格已到期，所以在发布2023年1月份标准价的时候，将S价自产半成品做了剔除，但是发布时，系统还是错误提示：下阶V价物料没有价格。
想咨询下各位老师，为什么将相关的成品所涉及的这个物料都有做了T除，全部T除干净后，这个S价物料还是报错了？是因为不允许T除半成品吗？这个T除有什么限制吗？

Hi LIZHEN,
剔除是指在所有存在的BOM里面把该半成品删掉了是吗？
估计是有没删除干净的状况，或者该物料在选择阶段仍然被选中了。

Hello Experts,
I want to restrict a role to only view on certain Cost Centers.What I did:
Maintain Business Roles ->

Maintain Restrictions->

Set the CostCenters in "Acess Categories" Read, Value Help & Value Help and apply "Leading Restriction"
But somehow the user is able to see ALL Cost Centers, when he uses for example the App "Supplier Invoice List"

Why does the role still allow to see all Cost Centers?
Only this restricted Role is applied to the user. 
Thank you!

Hi Manuel,
In app IAM Information System app id F2450  for 
"Business Role ID" include all roles assigned to the user
"Access category" equal to Read 
"Restriction field" contains Cost Center 
check whether there are not restricted items.
Especially for 'Cost Center Hierarchy'

We are implementing public cloud in our project. my module is SAP FICO. is it correct that all the configuration is done by SAP. Do we need to upload the master data and transaction data. will the GL accounts differ from the GL accounts given by SAP. if we need to change any configuration we manage your solution is it correct. how the transport of changed data is sent to Production. can anyone explain in brief.

Dear Experts,
My customer has service orders that will not expire prior to their fiscal year end.
Apart from running the 'Event-Based Revenue Recognition' process (which will do the necessary accruals/deferral adjustment postings), are there any other mandatory tasks/considerations required at the fiscal year close for the service orders to seamlessly transition into the new fiscal year with the ability to continue service order administration and present the service order financials?
Please confirm.

Hello All,
S4 HANA Cloud.
We are closing a Profit Center so currently we plan to block this Profit Center. However we have IC subledger as well as multiple offset entries already booked in this PC. We now want to transfer the balances to a new PC. Please help with below queries-
1.How can we transfer the old PC present at subledger line item. What process suits best in this case? Since its a recon account no direct transfer can be made.
2. There are few documents from older periods. Is there a way to avoid forex involvement for this scenario?
3. Is there any App which can help to post in all the currencies since old periods cannot be opened?
Thanks
Hi Vishal,
The allocation context for Profit Center is restricted to G/L account types N Non-operating expenses/income and X Balance sheet accounts (also documented in SAP Help - Allocation Contexts). But reconciliation accounts cannot be posted directly.
For the reposting you could create a new G/L account with type X (or N depending on original G/L account) and use this account as Overhead Allocation Account in the Universal Allocation. For the allocation type you use Overhead Allocation instead of a Distribution. As sender you can use reconciliation accounts in Universal Allocation, but for the posting you cannot use it.
This should result in a credit (debit) posting with the new G/L account on the old profit center and debit (credit) on the new profit center. For reporting you would have to assign the new G/L account into the same FSV node as the original (reconciliation) account.
This workaround should also be useful, if you want to repost primary/secondary costs elements on profit centers. See also KBA 3117138 - Allocating Amounts Between Profit Centers in Universal Allocation.

Hello,
We are using Embedded TM in S/4 HANA 2020.Somehow I am not able to find a proper method for mass maintenance of TM Transportation Lanes.
All information I've been able to find so far, whether by looking for IDocs or BApis in the system or via notes search and blogs, is about EWM Transportation Lanes it seems.
Indeed I found quite some references about BAPI_TRLSRVAPS_SAVEMULTI2 and IDoc TRLAPS_SAVEMULTIPLE202 for instance but the nodes structures of the bapi, in terms of carrier assignment to Transportation Lane, only point to BAPI11201TRMCARR2 which expect to provide carrier as location ID (and not as carrier BP).Hence this looks to me more like the data you provide when using transaction code /SAPAPO/SCC_TL5 (SCM EWM module) (where you can assign TSP location ID) rather then the one expected when using transaction code /SCMTMS/TL5 (TM module) (where you can assign actual carrier BP nr and herewith can benefit from automatic carrier selection when planning freight orders in TM). These two transaction codes seem to create the same transportation lane header and means of transport nodes but different nodes in term of carrier assignment. And the ones created via /SAPAPO/SCC_TL5 (SCM EWM) do not seem to be useable in TM carrier selection...
Anyone ever managed to create Transportation Lanes (and thus assign Means of Transport AND carriers) in TM.It seems odd to me, seeing the nr of instances to maintain that no other methods would be available other than the one provided in the transaction /SCMTMS/TL5 itself (tabs "Mass Maintenance") which only provides some collective maintenance feature and mostly copy options...
Thanks in advance
TSP assignment transaction /SAPAPO/SCC_TL5 (not useable in TM) (location ID)

Carrier assignment transaction /SCMTMS/TL5 (useable in TM) (carrier business partner)

Hi,
Scenario Builder - > You can use this TM application to download the templates for all kinds of master data (transportation lanes, zones). If you have the lane data (along with carrier) in a excel format, I believe Scenario builder would be most suitable for mass creation/update.
You could give this alternative a try to see if this suits your scenario.

Dear Experts,
I am working with inspection type 1701, I have posted the GRN through EWM and after GRN an Inspection Lot is being created but that is coming always in CRTD status instead of REL Status even though the inspection plan already exists in the system. See the below screenshots for reference.




The above one is being released without any error if I released it manually through QA02.

I want this lot should get released automatically once the lot is triggered after GRN posting.
Please help me to resolve the above issue.
Thanks in advance,
Mateen.
Hi
check around the sample calculation.
The drawing sampling procedure is probably asking for the number of containers to be able calculating the size of sample. And as far i know, depending to the S/4 Hana release, you have to apply an OSS note to get them from the EWM inbound delivery.
Hi Mateen
In this case, set the box "inspection 100%" in the inspection type 1701.
Seems not to be the case according to your screenshot
Are you using the physical samples?
I can see you are using the usage 9 (material check) for the inspection plan.
By default the inspection type 1701 is linked to usage 5 , check the customizing for the inspection type 1701 if its well linked to usage 9.
With QA02, are you manually select the usage 9 or coming from automatically?
Hi Mateen
Are you using embedeed EWM? Check QRSETUP configuration for the warehouse E001 and your inspection rule 4
May be some inconsistencies with inspection type 1701
We set up the flexible workflow for blocked invoices and the approver derivation and processing an approval works fine. However, if the workflow is rejected, it ends and in the Fiori-app no settings are possible to process anything further.
My expectation would be that when rejected the creator of the invoice receives a notification (ideally in the MyInbox-app, but alternatively also via email).
As an alternative, I tried to add an email notification (YY1_00800251_COMPLETE_NEGATIVE) but this doesn't get triggered either as it seems (other email notifications CRT_ALL work).
System is S/4 1909.
Hope anyone can assist. Thanks in advance.
Hi Achim,
Checking the documentation, it doesn't seem like completion E-Mails are supported in 1909 for this scenario (see here). I'm afraid you'll have to wait for 2020.
Best regards,
Mira
Thank you Mira, a release change is planned for later this year, but we cannot wait until then with the workflow change (due to legal reasons).
So part one of my statement becomes relevant, as I'm surprised that the flexible workflow (standard) in that regard does not provide a notification to the creator of the invoice in case of rejection. Is there a way to achieve this without having to utilize a customer specific workflow?
Hello All,
My webi report should showcase the data based on user response when user gives 2020 as year selection in prompt and in the cross tab or vertical table my years should go till 6 years such as 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 by fetching the revenue amount. Data is there in table till 2028 but based on prompt it should change dynamically. I did checked multiple blogs and implemented the same formula but data is showing differently and in turn amount is showing blank. As per the screen shot if you see when I give 2020 its bringing 2018 and 2019 which should not. 
I followed the below blogs but result is not showing as expected. Please do suggest.

If a virtual table is created in the BTP HANA Cloud DB it occupies the same amount of memory as the base table. Every virtual table will create a separate entry in the sys.views system view.

Hello Folks,
We make a permission filter to restrict display of planner data but we need to display same data (capacity that is shared between 2 planners). Is there a way to make restriction as mentionned previously.
Regards, 


 SAfouen Galai
Yes, you can create permission filters for planner data to restrict the display of certain data. To display the same data (capacity) that is shared between two planners, you can create a permission filter that includes criteria to ensure that the data is only visible to the appropriate users. Additionally, you can also assign user roles to ensure that only the necessary users have access to the data.
Hi
I was looking at the slides for cloud and for on-prem migration:
SAP S/4HANA Migration Cockpit - Migrate Your Data to SAP 
cloud: https://www.sap.com/documents/2020/07/7a263781-a67d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html
on-prem: https://www.sap.com/documents/2017/07/26113ac0-c47c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html 
I also saw similar questions but not really answers to it. How to perform multiple load cycles in public cloud?
On the slide of on-prem there is following sentence: "Several test data migrations are required before you transfer data to the SAP S/4HANA production system."
I think this is also required in cloud. Especially since processes usually need to be changed / adapted much more to the cloud system than to on-prem, it also means data need to be changed much more.
As the migration cockpit only allows creation of data but no change and having only two systems with single "client" it means that if data is loaded wrong first time there is no option to load it correctly as a test before productive load. Or is there a chance to load again into another "clean client"? Simulation is helpful but only when looking at a single object. If an error in Material Master load is only found during stock load, how to correct these errors and test the correction when the data is already loaded and there is no other test "client" available?
If in cloud environment only one load of data is enough before loading to production why does SAP think that is not true for on-prem?
Thanks!
Best regards

Thanks for your help in advance. 
you already solve this issue with removing Id's.that's good😊

destroy that xml fragment like this,
javascript - How i can destroy a fragment (or a view)? - Stack Overflow
Hi Former Member,

First access that element where you want to destroy it.

var id = sap.ui.getCore().byId("IDinFragment");
id.destroy();

Dhananjay
The Dialog component has an event called afterClose. You should use it to destroy your Dialog when you close it.
Example:



Another option, if you don't want to destroy the Dialog (whatever the reason you have), is to check if the Dialog has been instantiated, avoiding to create it again.

Example:

use the id for columns but keep the cells without IDs 
Hi guys,

I'm experiencing problems within VL10b.

I created a cross-company purchase order with all the necessary data. If I open VL10b and select the order (by date or order number... both works) it is shown just fine. BUT when I click the button for background creation, it doesn't work.

There's no log or error-message, just nothing which would give me a hint about what's the problem.

Anybody got any ideas what to check in order to find out where's the problem?

Any input is greatly appreciated... thx & regards,
Bobby
Make sure the PO is released and or the shipping data is populated

if the plant is not setup for shipping data than also you will not see the delivery
Hi,
Open your order & check 'Delivery Schedule' tab.
Check 'Delivery Date'. Check it to system date & then try to make delivery.
It should be displayed in VL10B - background check.

regards,
Chintan
Hey everybody,

issue closed!

Once again the problem was the confirmation control.... 

Thanks for your numerous input!

Dear SAP FIORI Experts,
when building an overview page via FIORI elements template, the ovp cards are not being rendered but are blank. You can check the error message in here: „Failed to get CardHelperServiceInstance.Error: sap.insights is not enabled for this system. - FioriElements: OVP.app.Component“
I tried with both OData V2 and V4. 

The same issue is also described here by rama anne:
https://answers.sap.com/questions/13753271/sap-fiori-elements-overview-page-table-card-odata.html 
The UI5 Version is the latest (1.108). 
I have adapted the manifest.json and added my annotations and tried out several examples with no success.
BRRufat
My sample app sap-support-message-reporting contains an OData V2 OVP with working cards. Maybe you find some inspiration there.

Kindly go through the below SAP KBA:1589593 - Cannot post a goods movement for a batch in lowercase.

Hi there,
is it possible to use a database view via SM30 / SM31?
I cannot find any possibility. I don't think that it is possible to create a maintenance view for a database view huh?
Background: In my use case I have to join multiple database tables for viewing.
Best regards,
Daniel
You can just use maintenance views in SM30/SM31.
You can create Maintenance view (in SE11 or SE54) and that can be used in SM30 afterwards.
Here is relevant ABAP docu:

I can create tables and views in the UI also I can read the space and table definitions using dwc-cli, but I am not able to create the table using the dwc-cli . I am getting this error "Required privileges are missing for the user to execute the request." 

 Is there any additional privilege required for DW modeler to create tables and views using dwc-cli?
Hi Atharva,
please make sure to not include the spaceDefinition property in case you only want to update the definitions. If you include the spaceDefinition property, the user is required to have update privilege on spaces. If you don't include it, DW Modeler privileges are sufficient.
Thanks,Jascha
Creating a table in SAP Data Warehouse Cloud (DWC) using Command Line Interface (CLI) is a straightforward process. The following steps should be followed to create a table in DWC:
Login to your DWC account using the command line interface (CLI).
Run the "create table" command followed by the table name, column name, data type, and column length. For example, to create a table named "Employee" with columns "Name" and "Age", the command would be: 
The table is then created in DWC.
Insert data into the table using the "INSERT" command. This command is used to add values to the columns. For example, to insert a record into the previously created table, the command would be: 
By following these steps, you can easily create a table in DWC using CLI.
Hi,i am following tutorial Deploy Your CAP Application on SAP BTP Kyma Runtime - Prepare SAP Launchpad Service Setup.In step 5, fiori add deploy-config cf is giving error. The error is "This Fiori application is within a CAP project and deployment should be configured as part of the CAP project."does this mean some files are missing ?
Hi there,
This error is returned when the deploy config logic cannot find an MTA in the root of the CAP project. The mta.yaml file needs to be present so that the Fiori application deploy config can be added. Can you please ensure you have an mta.yaml in your CAP project?

Hi expert,
 Our company uses Business ByDesign. In our Purchase Order Approval Process, we only set up local currency amount thresholds for different approval steps(levels). But in our business, many of our suppliers use foreign currencies. Recently, I found in our approval records with foreign currencies, ByDesign seems to ignore the currency, which may skip the approval processes that the POs should have. I don't know if my understanding is correct.
 In our configuration of Currency Conversion Profile, there is one for creating PO, which uses the exchange rate in posting date. Does that mean the system converts the foreign currency to local currency in approval processes to judge if the PO amount exceeds the approval thresholds? If yes, when is the date for the exchange? Here we choose "Posting Date", is that correct? Should it be "Document Date"?
 Thank you if you can explain the logics of catching exchange rates when we only set up local currency approval thresholds.

Best regards

Hi I have purchase requestions generated through MRP in which a plant is getting picked as fixed vendor I want to remove it..
How can it be done??
Thanks in advance
Dear Nikhil, 
Please check material master, MRP 2 view and value in field -> special procurement key
Also you can check source list setting -> transaction me01
You can accept answer if helpful. 
Not sure if it is a configuration issue with the RSP in SAP but it seems that I can't see the database on the dashboard.




Hello,
We had the same issue. We solved it by going to the path in RSP -> Configuration -> Channels ->Directory Channels, which was enabled with max directory size 500MB. Unfortunately, you cannot change the directory folder size to more than 500. So what we did was, we deleted the older files in the result folder (to free up some space) and restarted the "SAP Business One RSP Agent service". On the next log on in RSP we were able to see all our databases. 
I hope it works for you too.
Hi,
I have done Integration of SAP Service Cloud with Qualtrics for a process, were in once the ticket gets completed a email with "Qualtrics Survey URL is sent to the customer. Customer open the Qualtrics Survey to fill the Survey response. On submission of the Customer response, the Survey Details gets replicated back to tickets in SAP service Cloud. Our client has a requirement where in they want to have a report in SAP Service Cloud to have these details captured related to the Qualtrics Survey. We want to know if there's any standard report or Datasource for capturing Qualtrics data. We can see there's one report "Survey Score" earlier but that has been deprecated now this report does not captures the Survey Score and Percentage. 
I have checked "Ticket Survey Answers" datasource but It does not fetch the correct data.

Hello,
I've set related configurations to work with "Inventory-managed MPN" for interchangeable parts.
I have two problems: 
1- in production order the ATP popup is totally empty! as if ATP check doesn't recognize interchangeable part.
2- in Sales Order the ATP is executed automatically, and split the item therefore the sub-item is a substitute part and it is OK BUT I need the scenario that system open a dialog so that user could select between more than one part. 
Additional data: in the MIGO with reference to reservation the process work fine: the system open a dialog and I can select between suggestions.
my data is very simple. A, B and C are parts and they're all in one FFF-class fully interchangeable. also note that I'm using the standard/default setting for availability checking group "02".
SAP version is S4HANA.
- is specific configuration or something else missed?
- is it possible to have material exchange in CO11N automatically during backflush? (and also COGI)
Hello
In the customizing activity Define Settings for Material Exchange and Restricted Interchangeability, make sure that you selected Manual or Automatic material exchange for code CO09RIC, then try to run ATP manually for your production order component. 
I'm not an expert about sales order ATP, but I suppose that the same setting for the respective SD code should resolve the problem.

Hi sap gurus,
As per my client requirement the following scenerios i have to implement. So kindly give your valuable advise for the same
I have two Goods receipts with same batch. Suppose first GR qty is accepted with inspection lot, then second GR quantity also can add in same batch and same storage location without creating a new inspection lot.

Suppose first GR is rejected then for second GR new inspection lot will be created with same batch with same storage location.

Suppose first GR inspection lot is pending then second GR quantity also can add to first inspection lot.

Rgds,
Krishna
Hello 

You can do this by

1) Go to QM view in Material master
2) Inspection setup
3) Inspection type Details
4) Inspection control -  2 An inspection lot for each material ,batch & Storage location

If you set this indicator, the system creates only one inspection lot for each material and batch. This setting is only advisable for materials with a batch management requirement.

You can setup this in the default values of inspection type

Please revert back with your feedback

Regards

gajesh
Hi Krishna,

The solution provided to you by Gajesh is absolutely bingo for you. Will work perfectly. And as per best of my information, it will work, even if the material is not batch managed also.

So just do the settings as suggested by Gajesh, in the inspection type for material master. And check.

Regards,
Shyamal
I have applied the solution, but it does not work with the Handling Unit.

Hello,
In our system, when we create an outbound delivery, a stock reservation is made (Schd. for delivery). So if there is not enough stock users cannot create the delivery.
our need is to allow users to create a delivery even if there is no stock, with an incomplete status like the case of purchase orders when we do 'put the document on hold', nothing can be done (post goods issue...) but we can save the document.
We don't want to remove the stock reservation and control permanently, but we just want to be able to save the delivery and come back to process it when the stock is filled.Thanks.
Go to 0vlp, select your delivery item category where you can see a field "Check quantity 0".  Set this to warning so that system will allow you to create delivery and save.

Hello. 
I am trying to write a groovy script to exclude employees from my CPI integration. I need to exclude employees who have been terminated for 90+ days. 
So I would a script to remove employees when EmpJob/employmentNav/endDate is 90+ days from current date. 
Suggestions? 
Hi Heather,
Something like the following would work, but I did alter your payload slightly because it was not valid XML.  2 EmpJob entities were embedded in another EmpJob entity and they repeated but there wasn't a single root.  I ran this XSLT against your two lowest EmpJob nodes in a node named root.  Note the short circuiting and operator in the date check because your example has a date node with no value, which doesn't work with date functions.  Essentially, it is checking the 90 days in the past rule if there is a value and outputting nothing in that case, otherwise it outputs the node and all child nodes and attributes.
Regards,
Ryan Crosby
Attached is an example of my payload file after Success Factors call. 
payloadaftersfcall.txt
Yes, I would want the entire entry for the employee to be deleted from the file if the termination date is 90+ days in the past. 
Attached is a payload file with both a terminated employee (an example of what should be removed) and an active employee who should remain in the report. payloadaftersfcall.txt
In your payload, I see that you are using EmpJob Base entity. (this brings up all the measures of the employee's organizational change) . It's best to base EmpEmployment and navigate to the EmpJob entity. This will give you better management of the employee's hiring records. Well, you can better handle rehiring scenarios that can play bad for you. From my own experience and by recommendation of the ODATA SSFF manual it is advisable to consult first EmpEmployment.
Also try calculating in a script the date of 90 days in the past. and you can use in the extraction filter as a condition
Hi all,
is there a way to use the usage api within an Fiori Application created in BAS or is there an existing guide, which shows how to use it?
I would read via a $.ajax get against the monthlySubaccountsCost api endpoint, shown here: https://api.sap.com/api/APIUasReportingService/resource
Further information to this, can be found here: https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/monitoring-usage-information-using-apis-of-sap-usage-data-management-service
Is it possible to test against this service from the BAS or do I have to deploy the application each time to CF?
BR
In the details of the documentation you find Service Plans. You need to create an instance. Then you can create a destination that can be consumed in BAS using a service key that you've created.

Hi experts,
I have been looking for a solution for my problem, I already went through multiple questions & answers with the same problem but nothing seems to work for me.I am doing the SAP Learning Journey - Developing with SAP Integration Suite with my trial account and I am completely stuck on the topic where I need to publish a Product.

My user has all Roles Collections necessary as I have been following other questions & answers and yes, I am trying to access API Business Hub Enterprise before clicking on Publish but I always have the same screen, doesn't matter what I do (clear browse history, use incognito chrome mode or even delete and assign all Roles Collections again)

If I click on Login button it does the contrary, it logout.
Please, any clues here on what I have to do so it really works?
Hello Flavio,
I have the same problem in my trial account. I also tried to delete the capability and also deleting the whole SAP Integration Suite and reconfiguring everything. This did not work. I wrote a mail to SAP to help me on that but since 4 days no answer. You should open up an ticket or write a mail to SAP. They should be able to reset the configuration so that you can try it again.
The problem seems to be, that I opened the API Business HUB Enterprise before configure the APIM. Normaly with the role APIManagement.SelfService.Administartor you should see the "APIs" Link under Settings:

This example picture is from another tennant there the configuration was done correct. In my case I do not see this link on my trial account although I have the role collection. 
Only after configure the APIM over this link the API Business HUB Enterprise will work correct.

The relationships is deleted in the BP the source system, how it can be replicated to the target in mass? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
Manual replication will not trigger a deletion of the last relationship. If you want to achieve this switch your system settings from Pooled Output to Direct Output (or Object-Dependent Default) and it will work automatically. If "Object-Dependant Default" is set a deletion of the relationship will automatically trigger a deletion message for the relationship. There is no other way to send the deletion of the relationship message. Another option would be to use the changes option in DRFOUT.

For this you can do on your terminal :

Hi Experts,
We have recently exported and Imported one of our environment in PaPM Cloud from one tenant to another.
Post import we are unable to see the Reports which are defined in the process management. We have also deployed the process but the report section is completely blank.
Please see the attached print screen for your reference.

Regards,
Vishal
Hi Vishal,
Thank you for raising this topic in the Community! ��
To begin, if you have a newly imported environment, it is expected for the reports to be empty, even if a process instance has been created (deployed). 
Given this behavior, it is recommended to create a new Report with report elements. 

Once these has been created and you return to the environment screen, the new report will now be displayed.

Hope this clarifies your concern.
Best Regards,
Venus Cruzat
Hi Vishal,
If the environment you imported already has a report, this is the expected behavior. The report will not appear in the Environment under Reports initially after being imported. If you have a created report (imported environment), when you create a new process instance (open/deployed), the reports will now be visible in the Environment screen under reports after saving it.
Hope this answer your question.
Thank you,

I tried to extract the Body data from the XML payload, but couldn't succeed so I blogged and couldn’t found the one which suits my requirement. Hence I am writing this blog to make the script/Content Modifier based on the requirement.

Then add a Filter step configured like this:

you can declare a content modifier and copy the body into a parameter, that you set as the body of the message.

how to recalculate accumulated depreciation for capitalized fixed asset
situation
after go-live and try to create depreaciation run for novamber 2022 , find that the system calculate the deprecation from jan 2022 till novamber 2022.
Hello mahmoud sawaby,
Please refer below SAP Note.
https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/2166002
Regards,
Neeraj Jain 
Hi Mahmoud,
I'm not sure if I fully get the scenario, bur in In general, if the asset has depreciation from before you joined ByD, the accumulated depreciation and amounts can be migrated. The depreciation computation is ByD takes place once the transactions are posted and are relevant for depreciation calculation depending on the depreciation method and period control keys.

Alexandre.
Hello, I can no longer connect to SAP, nor to have access to the file, following a migration of the servers. How can I solve this problem.
In addition I have an error message at the SNC level.
Thanks in advance
Hi experts,
I am trying to create Automatic cleaner for Customer Accounts and their invoice, credit memo documents in Receivables Work Center. With clearing I mean change status from "Open" to "Cleared".I Found corresponding Business Objects (DueClearing, TradeReceivablesPayablesRegister ) which should helped me a lot but both of them are No Write access Allowed. When I choose customer account where I want to clear some documents and click on "Clear Manually" it automatically show me standard screen "New Manual Clearing" where I have to click on "Clear" button. So my question is if there is Business Object with this kind of action to allow me clear it automatically or if there is some kind of workaround ?
Best regards.
Dear Lukas,
What you have explained in the question is the standard process of Business by design where it clears the open items.
In case if you are looking for customized or automation of clearing,you might have to look for some custom solutions and provide specific use case as to why you have to do so in an incident.
Regards,
Manasa 
Hi Lukas, 
 If you want an automated process to regularly clear or 'clean' larger numbers of open Receivables, thereby accepting a certain degree of fuzziness, you could look into the application-feature 'Clearing Runs' (assign business-user to corresponding view in WoC: Receivables). 
 Here open credit-postings would be matched with candidate open debits according amount, due-date etc.. 
 Hope this helps, 
 Frank 
Hi Lukas,
As mentioned in previous comments, there is a standard feature named Clearing Run, that can be scoped in business configuration.
Apart from that, you could create your own custom solution with reuse libraries, as the DueClearing business object is not write enabled. For details, please refer to Due Clearing Utilities (SAP Business ByDesign Only) | SAP Help Portal

We are experiencing ongoing problems with Instance refresh tool within SuccessFactors product
since H2 2022 release.
we would like to know if other customers are also impacted by these issue and if they have visibility on 
which actions to do in order to request instance refresh : 
- for BIZX

Hi Shivani,
Hello,
I am trying to use AF_Modules/DynamicConfigurationBean to insert password value from REST sender adapter to later use it in my mapping. I am trying to avoid hardcoding this value in the map which is why I am trying to use this functionality to mask it.
But for some reason, it is assigning a null value. If I set the parm name to value.1, it works fine. But masking is lost.
What am I missing?
Is there another way to mask the password in mapping using a java UDF maybe? 


Hello, have you solved it?
Give pwd.value.1 instead of pwd.1
hello all
this is a simple question but as I am relatively new to this formula stuff, please be patient. :-)
I also looked for answers in the forum and found some which I had already tried and did not work.
Basically, I need the following:
a specific work center in a routing, performs an operation in a prod order, that lasts 10 minutes and must be lot size independent. no matter what the quantity produced is, this specific Labor operation lasts 10 minutes.
I understand it is WC Labor formula related but I tested several possibilities and the labor duration remains on 0 even if I set it to 10 min.
Can someone guide me to this?
thanks
Hello Alisa
I wrote the following wiki explaining the basic settings that you should use in your work center for scheduling and capacity leveling. In this example, I have used formula SAP002 as the processing formula in the scheduling tab of the work center: 
SAP002 = Machine * Operation quantity / Base quantity / Operation splits
In your case, you would have to create a custom formula, removing any reference to the operation quantity, base quantity and operation splits, so the formula results would be basically the machine time (or labor time, if this is the case).
In your routing, you will then add the 10 minutes as the machine or labor time, and you should get the desired results.

I have set up Flexible Workflow for Purchase Order in the development environment including two test scenarios. Everything works fine in DEV. The workflow definition WS00800238 is transported to the test environment, and the scenarios has not followed this transport. When launching the Fiori APP Manage Workflows for Purchase Orders in TEST, I am denied change mode and the message is: 
 Modification is not allowed. 
The workflows were imported from the development system. 
Need help to resolve this issue!
Hi Joachim,
We generally advice to only modify flexible workflows on the development system for the following reason: 
All workflows for a scenario form one logical unit together. Let's say for example you want to create a new workflow valid only for large purchase orders. You create a new workflow with preconditions, move it to the correct position in the workflow list, activate it, and deactivate a now obsolete workflow for large purchase orders. If you do this on the productive system, there is one point in time when you have two workflows for the same conditions or one point in time when you have no workflow for the condition. 
It is possible (if you have only the productive system and no development system for example) to develop flexible workflows on the productive system, but you should be aware of the risk. 
If you do transport flexible workflow content to a system, we save this information and will prevent changes on the scenario from this point on. You can reset this flag using the App "Manage Workflow Scenarios" (Fiori ID F3067). Any changes that you perform on the test system will be overwritten by the next transport!
Best regards,
Mira
Thank you Mira,
This is actually what I have done. The standard workflow WS00800238 is transported to test successfully. However, the test scenario I have added in the App Manage Workflows for Purchase Orders is NOT transported. Yes, I have added the scenario to a customizing request created for this purpose in SE10, and used the "Scenario Content" pushbutton in the maintenance view SPRO (scenario activation), relased it and imported it to test. However, my added scenario is not showing in the Fiori App in the test environment. Thus I started to wonder if these scenarios are meant to be created in each system. 

DEV:

TEST (After trasport/Import):

Best regards
Joachim
Hi Joachim,
What release of S/4HANA are you in? I am working in a 1909 FP2 Enterprise Cloud system and do not have the "Scenario Content" button. I also doubt you need to transport a standard delivered scenario. What needs to be transported are the start conditions, steps, step conditions and agent rules that you define in the Manage Workflows app. I have been trying to find an answer to this for more than a year. I developed a custom flexible workflow for a customer in 1809 on premise system and that's when I realized the configured steps cannot be transported. Below is the link to my question. No helpful answer from SAP.

Hi Joachim,
Were you able to resolve the issue? I am facing the same problem in our system and couldnt really find why I cant add new Workflows in Test.

Hello,
I noticed that when we update BP catalog numbers with a large number of records it takes a long time to update even when we are inserting one new recording. It seems that ALL the records are getting updated altogether. Is it possible to only update it to add only the single row we added to minimize the update time with DIAPI?

Hi Xela,
you can use the DTW for updating it.
regards Lothar
Hi,
With the DI API it will be faster than the client, but developing an addon is not easy. Assuming that you do not need to performs such updates multiple times a day, you should think about the ROI on your time.
As per Lothar Hasenkämpers' answer, you can also do it with the DTW. It too is faster, but you cannot update existing BP catalogue numbers with it. I am not sure if you can delete BP catalogue numbers with it.

Johan

Hi, 
I am new to Fiori Elements and sadly our backend ABAP version doesn't support CDS views. So I am using SEGW based OData service with additional annotation file in UI project. I have a requirement to show smart multi input control for 'plant' field to capture multiple plants in an Object Page. 
I checked the documentation for this but it seems uncomplete to me as it doesn't has any annotation or metadata sample code. Could some one please provide an example for this case or guide me a little further?  https://ui5.sap.com/1.65.0/#/topic/04ff5b1a81344a8e8169ea99630ff4e5
So I have two entities 'Variant' and 'Plant'. Here Variant is the main entity which has a 'Plant' property and 'ToPlant' navigation property based on following association
<Association Name="VariantToPlant" sap:content-version="1">
    <End Type="ZTEST_EKANSH_SRV.Variant" Multiplicity="1" Role="FromRole_VariantToPlant" />
    <End Type="ZTEST_EKANSH_SRV.Plant" Multiplicity="*" Role="ToRole_VariantToPlant" />
    <ReferentialConstraint>
        <Principal Role="FromRole_VariantToPlant">
            <PropertyRef Name="VariantId" />
        </Principal>
        <Dependent Role="ToRole_VariantToPlant">
            <PropertyRef Name="VariantId" />
        </Dependent>
    </ReferentialConstraint>
</Association>


'Plant' entity just has two properties 'PlantKey' and 'VariantId'.
The annotation for Plant field which I want to be as smart multi input field is as below (removed some extra fields):
<Annotation Term="UI.FieldGroup" Qualifier="GeneralData">
    <Record Type="UI.FieldGroupType">
        <PropertyValue Property="Data">
            <Collection>
                <Record Type="UI.DataField">
                    <PropertyValue Property="Value" Path="Vendor" />
                </Record>
                <Record Type="UI.DataField">
                    <PropertyValue Property="Value" Path="Plant" />
                </Record>
            </Collection>
        </PropertyValue>
    </Record>
</Annotation>


Based on this, currently it shows a normal smart field with only single select.

BR, Ekansh

Alright. I got it working with following changes:
Hi Amit,
yes i solved it. 
you have to make a 1..N composition in the root entity like this:



and make an annotation with value like this:
  
the result in the ADT:


Best regards 
Sebastian Sobierajski
Hello Ekansh,
 currently I also have the requirement to map a Multi Select Combobox. I am trying to implement the 1-N association in a RAP based service. So my question. Have you been able to finish your implementation? If so, can you publish the complete annotation here? I would like to compare this with mine :-)

Hello - is it possible to hide the job req originator on the position org chart under Job Requisition Details? 
 Amanda Burton this KBA might be useful 2464841 - How To Change Order or Hide the Side Panels on the Position Org Chart (Employee Central)  but that will hide the side panel for Job Requisition details in the Position Org Chart.

*Please consider marking this answer as solution if your question was properly answered
Thank you for the sharing the KBA. I found that article the other day and discovered that its an all or none sort of situation. There is not a way to hide only the Job Originator which was what I was hoping to do. There are some situations where there are more than one job originator and this may be confusing for some of our people leaders who have access to the position org chart details to see this information. 
Hello Experts, 
In the Custom Cds Views app I am searching for a standard view or cube that contains the "IsObsolete" Field of a Contact. Unfortunately after my checks I was not able to find it. 
Does anyone of you maybe know where this is available?

Hi Christof Blaickner,
Long time, hope you're well.
You're right, the IsObsolete field is not provided by SAP to be used in any of CDS intentionally and it won't be for technical reasons!

Hi Expert,
Could you please help me on below
We are doing a greenfield S4HANA 2021 implementation, Now regarding accessing SAP system ,we will follow Fiori first approach , still we need to understand one thing here
Do we need SAP GUI for Windows anymore? is there any functionality that FIORI can not cover and SAP GUI has it?
If we still need SAP GUI for certain functionality, then which user will need that.. For example Business user probably do not need SAP GUI,
whom from IT user like BASIS, SECURITY, DEVELOPER, FUNCTIONAL CONFIGURATERM need access to SAP GUI in that case? 
It would be helpful for us to know this in order to define strategy
Actually I am not getting any side by side comparison between SAP GUI on windows vs FIORI , to determine why the hybrid approach (Both SAP GUI and FIORI) is preferred obviously keeping in mid that it should be FIORI First approach.
Could you please guide
Thanks
Bikram
Hi Bikram,
GUI or FIORI is mostly more of how you wish to work with the look and feel and less of obligation.
Fiori has everything a GUI has with some sophistication and ease but that does not mean GUI is not needed.
As very rightly said in the blog There is no need to treat SAP Fiori as replacing SAP GUI – moving to SAP Fiori is not an “either/or” decision, in practice it is an “and also” decision.
https://blogs.sap.com/2021/03/31/sap-fiori-for-sap-s-4hana-recommendations-for-transitioning-users-from-sap-gui-to-sap-fiori/
The scenario is explained beautifully in the above blog.

Hi Experts,
We did have an OData query in our system which uses OData publish true, however it uses a different class.
Please find below the screen shot:

This used to use a custom class for exposure and that was the warning message that was shown. We were doing some package re-assignment and we ,commented the annotation: @OData.Publish: true and it seems it has deleted the custom class that was generated along with the configuration.
Below is the screen shot of the QA where the custom class exist:

Can you please suggest what is the process to regenerate the custom class. We dont want to go through transport import from QA to Dev as that would be the last option. What we want to understand is what is the standard process of generating a custom class artifact when we use OData publish true. I am surely missing anything.
Thanks

"If value-date is between january and March, and Posting-date is between October and December, Value date = Vale date minus 1 year". This is in turn giving an error. Experts please assist.

Hi Experts,

Can i copy a sales order from existing ones? I am not referring to create by reference. Just create the new sales order which has the same information as the existing.

Thanks
Hi,

 You can create another Sales order with the same information but keep one thing in mind the Sales order number will be different.

I think this solves your doubt.

Thanks

I know you are not referring to 'Create by ref' but it seems thats the option you are looking.

If you hit 'Create with ref' on VA01 and goto 'Order' tab and specify the sales order number which you want to copy it will copy all the values from that order and create a new one for you.

And of course sales order number will be different.
Hi,

If you wanted to do this programatically, then you need to fetch all the details of the existing sales order and create a new one using BAPI_SALESORDER_CHANGE.
Hi guys,

I know what you mean. But if i create by reference, the field VGBEL in table VBAK will have the sales number as reference. 
Anyway, thanks for the suggestions.

Thanks
So I am using cl_salv_table=>factory alv to display some data in an internal table to a user.
At the selection screen the user has the option to fill in a language parameter.
So for example if a user is logged with EN language, but fills DE for the parameter, I'd want to display the information from the alv in German - That includes the name of the columns and all the content in the fields.
Is this possible? Thank you.
You can use SET LOCALE LANGUAGE command before the SALV factory method call.
Here are details in the ABAP help docu:
https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abapset_locale.htm
Do not forget to change language back after the SALV display :-)
EDIT: I have to mention that according to programming guidelines: "Set the statement SET LOCALE LANGUAGE in exceptional cases only, and reverse any text environment switches in good time." ! Maybe someone knows better way to switch ALV output language.
Dear SAP Guru,

where should I clear this Issue?
Thanks in advance

Hi Lakshmi Narayanan,
CGST & SGST is applied when you have the sales transaction happening within the state for 9% each
In your case to fix the issue check the seller region and Buyer region in customer master is same ,if its a state to state transaction then it must IGST,

Hi,
i've question regarding the movement of articles that has "Q" type stock and have inspection lot assigned between different storage locations.
For the article "XYZ" there is inspection type 01 assigned for GR. The parts are stored at warehouse and wait for the usage decision. The problem is that parts can be move into the production storage location via LT10 or MF60, despite the fact that the article is "Q" stock and has inspection lot. Is this a standard to allow posting Q-stock between different storage locations without usage decision?
Is there any way to disallow moving the parts with Q-stock between different storage location? Is it on the customizing or permission level? 
anyone could help?

I want to check if a record already exist in a table ( zcustomer ) by using it's primary key ( zzcustomer_no) before inserting a new record from the structure table ls_customer to actual table zcustomer. how do i do that?
you can use modify statement, which will internally check the entries before inserting into custom table zcustomer.
Hello,
You can use the code below:
You can also check the following blog from Michael Keller - the ‘X’ in the select statement
Just read any already existing record with a simple SELECT statement.  (or use a dirty ACCEPTING DUPLICATE KEYS or a dirty MODIFY)
But first check duplicate records in the internal table.

Hi, 
I am trying to create a simple regex check for an entity. 
My regex is
\bCHG
My test string is 'CHG123'. I am not finding a match. 'CHG 123' does find a match. 
Can anyone provide me some help regarding this matter. I have put the same regex into an online testing tool and it appears to be working there, but not in SAP CAI. 
Thanks
Martin
From what I can see, the CAI regex will check each "token" (i.e., each word) and see if it matches in its entirety.
So for you, if you want to match any "word" that starts with CHG, then something like this would work:
Just above the regex, it says this: "Your regex pattern will match for the entire token of your bot."
NOTE: This would match "CHG" when you entered "CHG 123" or "CHG123" when entering "CHG123". I assume this is OK, but if not we could use lookahead.

1) Transaction field selection keys (ME31, ME32, ME33, ...)
2) Activity field selection keys (AKTA, AKTE, AKTH, AKTV)

Hi,
We do have a doubt regarding the Indirect access using SAP Cloud iRPA.
We have build an RPA using SAP iRPA that create documents, but sometimes the button where the RPA must click is not avaiable becasue of the screen resolution (it is automatically hidden in the menu tab). To solve this we have created using SAP itself a script to make the shortcut corresponding to that button, as with SAP iRPA we are not able to run shortcuts. 
My question is, is this consider as indirect access as the RPA is running an VBScript to create the document?
Thanks!
Hello All,
I am working on the integration of a CAI chatbot with SAP AppGyver/SAP Build Apps. I am able to add script code inside webView where it will load as a frame inside app, But I am not able to add that script code inside the app of SAP AppGyver/SAP Build Apps to make it load without any frame as in webview.
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Sindhu
Hi,
At the moment, using the WebView is the only way to integrate it. After some testing, using a SAP Conversational AI Web Client in the "Connect" tab seems to be working great. 
An alternative solution would be integrating an API that calls CAI: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CONVERSATIONAL_AI/3aab817a03be4432abbfd00c42b23cb8/22d65b5127c54fb684d7962ec66af8bb.html Following this path would even allow you to build your own chat interface.
Hi Sindu,
Have you tried using JS component to the event where you want to load the app.
Thank you!!
Dear experts, hello!
I'm looking forward to be using GCTS in my company and I already customized it, it works fine.
But honestly I have many question about how to manage architecture / branching in it, it really feels like we can't use GIT to its full extent. I'm pretty sure I missed / misunderstood something as I'm no expert in GIT.
If I consider a simple landscape : DEV, QUAL & PROD. 
My understanding from the open SAP course is I have to create one repo for workbench and one repo for customizing. I saw 3 branching possibility but I see major issues on these solutions. Still I'm unable to find something satisfying.
1) One branch for each environment.+ one branch for hotfixes. Development is made on dev branche then we merge DEV with QUAL when testing is requested. When test is successfully done, we go live by merging with prod branch.
On simple cases, it seems fine but in real life it seems to not be sustainable. When feature A is developed then feature B is developed. Feature B cannot go live without feature A. I have the feeling that here we cannot work with a single repo for workbench. But in that case how should we divide our repos as there usually are interdependencies between our objects?
2) One branch per feature + one main for production. Each feature is developed on DEV and is pushed to the feature branch when development is done. The feature branch is pulled on QUAL system for testing. When testing is done successfully, the feature branch is merged to production.
Here, if feature A is developed then feature B is developed it seems to work fine: we can pull A or B in qual to test them independently. Then we can choose to merge A or B to production. But to a higher scale it seems rather complex to handle testing. If we have to checkout to the branch to be tested: we can only test on feature at a time in quality system. It cannot be acceptable on real project.
3) One branch per feature + one branch per environment. The same as previously except we can merge the feature in quality then in production when test is done successfully. It allows to implement multiple features to be tested in quality and fix the issue we had in 2.
The main issue here (and this is the biggest pain point on GCTS in my opinion) is we can't develop multiple branches in development system at the same time. If developer for feature A is developing for his branch: developer for feature B cannot checkout to branch B as it would "erase" feature A from the dev system. A solution would be to create different repositories, maybe one repo for each package would be an idea. But whenever there will be interdependencies (because it will happen of course) I think it will behave pretty poorly.
I heard about a solution using docker to mimic dev systems for each develop to be able to develop on their own system that would fix anything.
Any one has ideas, feedback on such topic? I'd be very interested.
Thanks for reading my text.
I did a drawing at https://github.com/larshp/two-alv-reports#full-monty on how to retain the flexibility of CTS but with git branching

Hello Anand,
Did you ever figure this out? I am dealing with the same issue and I have not been able to work out a solution so far.
Thanks in advance.
Edit on 09.16.
It is possible to make your custom rest service (not odata) work with oAuth. I was able to work a proof of concept and it appeared to work. I cannot share too many details on the configuration but these guides helped me get through the config:
Now with this being said, I had to pursue another route as this did not end up fitting my scenario, and the reason is the following. In my scenario I had my own SAP box, so not cloud, and I needed to communicate through a REST API with another server that takes care of Interactive Voice Response. The show stopper was that the oAuth flows that SAP supports (not cloud) are Bearer Assertion Flow (with SSO) and Authorization Code flow. SSO was out of the question due to some technical reasons, and Authorization Code flow requires user interaction (this is like when you use your Facebook account or other account to log into a 3rd site, that pop up that you get to accept the log in). In my scenario there was not going to be an user in between, so that made me throw this away. Now I also have to say that if you are working with SAP cloud, oAuth Client Credentials grant it is supported and you can find plenty of literature only on how to configure it.
I hope this helps someone.
Kr,
I am also same issue , please share details if any one have solution
 Rest API and we are the providers (using handler & cl_rest_resource) any oauth2.0( ) configuration -?

Please see my attachment bellow.
Hi Thiago da Silva Moura,
This HTTP request appears to be the same which we use while inserting multiple records into a No Object type User Defined Table.
The issue is that it is not supported because the mentioned payload does not follow oData protocol.
As a workaround, kindly verify whether oData Batch request helps for your cause or not.

Dear SAP experts,
we're working for a customer subject to Italian localization and we'd like to understand how we could manage the cash discount. Basically, we performed:
1. Supplier Invoice Posting through app "Create Supplier Invoice" using std doc. type X1, for a net amount of €100,00 (VAT 22%) and days / percent. 30 / 5%;
2. Outgoing Posting through app "Post Outgoing Payment" using std doc. type ZP for an amount given by €122,00 minus €6,10 (because cash discount days were satisfied). Performing this step, we got the mentioned error "Doc. type ZP not relevant for any VAT Register" because in SSCUI 102451 doc. type ZP is not available.
Our solution could be to have three different doc. types (e.g. ZD, ZE, ZX) to be linked in SSCUI 102451 respectively vs VAT registers INCD, INCEU, INEXEU, choosing properly the desider doc. type for manual payment but this approach doesn't work for automatic where we have always a unique doc. type.
Have you any idea how we can satisfy the requirement?
Thanks,
Massimiliano
Hi
While I would say that you can add ZP to tax register as well as tax code, as the payment clearing process generates tax line items while processing the cash discount,  I also understand that the combinations can vary.
I suggest you please login a ticket in FI-LOC-CNT-IT, best practices for Italy and colleagues may advise properly.
Thank you so much

Dear experts,
I create an iFlow in DEV, activate and deploy it. Now when I transport the iFlow using CTS+ to our TEST/QA system do I have to deploy it manually again?
Thank you, Peter
Hi Peter,When you create the IFlow in NWDS, you have to activate and  deploy the iflow in NWDS.
Once the iFlow is deployed, you will see the ICO is attached to the iFlow.
It is very important when you transport to higher env. you should only include the iFlow in your CTS+. And then once transport is successful you have to deploy the iFlow in higher env. using NWDS- this will create the ICO. If you select both iFlow and ICO to transport , it will fail when you will try to activate and deploy the iflow.
Thanks

However, when i change the same to a single approver in the step decision ( First Hit ), It works for me and i can assign the same to the list of users. Anyone has faced any issue related to this before ? In other word, it does not allow me to assign list to the approval step for users. Any options available related to this. I can see role collection/group option is there but is it not possible to assign multiple users as approver in the user step. I guess in classical workflow management subscription , it used to work.
Thanks

Hello Tirthanka, 
SAP Workflow Management will be supported until the existing license expires. The phase out is only for new deals and customers. Please contact your SAP Customer Success Partner for more details. 
Regards,Archana
Hello Tirthankar,
We will very soon release feature where the List output from decision table can be mapped as recipients of the Form. Currently this is not possible. In meantime, can you please send across the screenshot of what the issue. 
Hello Tirthankar, 
In SAP Build Process Automation, multiple users cannot work together as the project gets locked. So conflicts will not occur. All the versions are currently stored in our repository. For now you can view and export the project of any version, but cannot edit but going forward you can also edit any old version. There is no plan to integrate with Git as setting up Git is more of a pro-code developer but our new no-code tool come more embedded features for easier version management and lifecycle management etc. 
Hope that helps,Archana 
Dear Experts, Am working on consignment settlement process. We had set up the config for IDoc creation for Consignment settlement MRKO. Now, an IDoc is generating only for company code 1000 but for other CoCds, IDocs are not getting generated.

I am a Java developer and I am shifting my carrier to SAP CONSULTANT.
I am a fresher to SAP.
I want to become SAP certified development associate and specialist on S4 HANA.
1. Which certification I must do ?
2. Is ABAP still essential to learn the new SAP S/4 Hana ?
3. Is SAP S/4 Hana Cloud is an Advanced Version of SAP S/4 Hana.
I am totally confused. Kindly guide me a proper learning path
Thank You.
Hello KIRAN KUMAR
1. Which certification I must do ?
Certification is not a must, but nice to have. There are plenty of options - check out: 
https://open.sap.com/
https://learning.sap.com/
https://training.sap.com/
2. Is ABAP still essential to learn the new SAP S/4 Hana ?
Yes, it is. ABAP is a backbone of S/4HANA. Pure ABAP is just an entry point. On top of that you need to learn other technologies like CDS, BOBF, RAP, UI5 etc. Also some understanding of S/4HANA functionality will be beneficial.
3. Is SAP S/4 Hana Cloud is an Advanced Version of SAP S/4 Hana.
S/4HANA is available in two flavors: in the cloud and on premise. None of them is "advanced version" of the other.

Hi
While running an Automation using the Forms, it fails with the following error
[{"msg":"Error in [downloadVariableSet]","data":{"errorValue":"TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]:

The forms are properly connected to the Automation and the project is deployed. It contains few Env variables which are defined while deploying the project. When we run the automation in test mode, it runs perfectly. 
I did not see much traces/logs in Monitoring -> Automation Jobs. Only the following info is available

Any pointers would be helpful. 
Thanks
Sandip

Hi
Ok, so from further investigation we found - the issue is coming from the code which reads the Env Variables. 
We are using the following API to get the variable, but it does not return the value.
The same API works fine when we run the Automation in Test Mode, but fails when we run it in UnAttended Mode. 
The version of Desktop Agent is 3.9.47.

Hello All,
We have created many Live and import connections in our SAC tenant. Our source systems are B4HANA and S4HANA. Also excel in some cases. Our clients also use Analysis For Office (AFO). So whenever a client log into AFO he sees all these connections and its so confusing for him to select a correct connection to build his report. So we want to hide these additional connections so that these connections should not show up both in SAC and AFO.
Please suggest if there is a way to hide connections in SAC.
Thank you.
Hello,
I do not think so this feature is available in SAC as of now. We can not hide the connection.
We you want this in future. You can raise an enhancement request so that it will get implemented in future,

Dear Experts,

After posting GR for an Inbound Delivery in EWM, A PPF action is generated for creating WT. After processing PPF action, the Warehouse task creation fails and the task is stuck in the Inbound Queue.

In SMQ2, I can see the task with status = RETRY and error message text “Command to tRFC/qRFC: Execute LUW again”.

Can you please help us resolve the issue?

This seems to a general error and any help to solve this would be highly appreciated.

Hi Shashidar, 

If everytime the message is getting stucked after removing the entries in the affected queue, then deregister the queue in Tx SMQR and then regsiter it again with activation.

Note: First remove the stucked messages in the affected queue and then do the above step.

Now try to trigger the message.

Regards
Robinson
Shashi, Please check if the queue is locked (SM12). Deleting the queue entry from SM12 can also resolve this issue
Hi Shashidar,

If the issue is still not resolved, I hope in the proxy the COMMIT statement is included when the proxy class is called.In this case, you can observe the status of the message in Tx sxmb_moni with white flag
"waiting to be committed".

Kindly inform whats the status of the message when you drill down to message monitor from Tx smq2.

Hi,guys.

 When I was executing the report J_3RMOBVEDH, I find that the Debit Revaluation/Credit Revaluation Display during the wrong period , the Debit Revaluation line posting date is the expiration date for executing interface inputs, i know it was wrong.
 In other words , this report if I query this report by month, n the monthly statement, the amount of this debit revaluation is the same and equal to the amount of this material's debit revaluation up to now, Obviously this should not be reasonable, each month's data should be the amount of each month.



 I hope someone can help me with this question.

Hello,
how can I modify the journal entry after the creation of a supplier invoice?
Note that I can modify the entry from financial management modules, but what I want is to be able to modify from the invoice itself.
Any ideas ?
Hi,
When you told that you can modify JE, I guess that you can update some informative fields only: cost center, due date, remark,... You can not change the G/L accounts that are the key info in JE. That is system behavior.
In the case, you can cancel / reverse to adjust the wrong JE.
Hope this helps,
Son Tran
Hi,
Any change in the Invoice is not going to update the JE created for the Invoice.
You have two options:
1. Update the fields(which can be updated) from the Finance Module > Journal Entry and search for the relevant Journal Entry.
2. Right click on the Invoice and click on the Journal Entry option. The associated JE will open and then the fields which can be updated can be changed.
Since JE is a legal documents, once they have been entered, most of the things cannot be changed.
Kr,
Jitin
Hello,
Thank you for your help,
for the first solution It Works, but the second one I tried I can't modify the JE, 
what I want to modify is REF2.
Hi,
In your case, you can use Reference Field Link function to reconfigure link between supplier vendor and ref2 in JE.

Dear all,
I am from non technical/IT background but trying to land a job in data analytics. For the last 5 months, I have been constantly learning Python, SQL and Tableau. Some people also advised me to learn SAP as one of ETL tools. However, i got confused because there are too many SAP module such as SAP BODS, SAP ABAP, SAP EDI, SAP S/4 HANA and many more. I don't know which one should I focused on. I thought all modules of SAP were under ETL tools.
Based on what I read, SAP S/4 HANA is the latest version of SAP. Can you guide and advices me which one should I choose ?
Regards,
Aina
Hi,
It's great that you're learning Python, SQL, and Tableau! Those are important skills for a data analytics career.

Regarding SAP, it's true that there are many modules and areas to focus on, and it can be overwhelming for someone who is new to the field. SAP is a vast and complex system used in many industries, so it's important to narrow down your focus to a specific area that is relevant to your career goals.

SAP S/4 HANA is indeed the latest version of SAP, and it is a powerful platform for managing enterprise data. However, it is not an ETL tool in the traditional sense. SAP S/4 HANA is a full ERP system that includes modules for finance, logistics, sales, and more. It is typically used by large corporations with complex business processes.

If you're interested in using SAP as an ETL tool, you may want to look into SAP Data Services (formerly known as SAP BODS). SAP Data Services is a data integration and transformation tool that allows you to extract data from multiple sources, transform it, and load it into a target system. It is often used for data warehousing and business intelligence projects.

If you're interested in learning SAP Data Services, you'll need to have a basic understanding of SQL and data modeling concepts. You may also want to learn about SAP's data structures and tables, as well as the basics of ABAP programming.

I recommend doing some research on different SAP modules and talking to professionals in the field to get a better sense of what would be most relevant for you.

Regards. 
Hi Aina, 
Welcome to the SAP world,
You can very well learn SAP S/4 HANA, first, you can get some of the free SAP online courses at https://open.sap.com/ and then get into the real SAP courses. 
Regards
SS
In addition to what Raheel suggested. SAP BODS is used with both SAP R3(ERP), SAP HANA(ERP). Also works with non-SAP ERP like a SQL or Other db based systems. So since you are working on learning python, SQL, and Tableau. I recommend learning SAP BODS over HANA. There are several tutorials online for the tool. BODI is a synonym used for BODS. Good luck.
As a beginner in the SAP world, and trying to get orientation in it you might want to look at this free course at Coursera:
https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/sap-technology-consultant#courses
Happy learning!
Hello Everyone,
I would like to know how can i get the response from SAP B1 HANA Service Layer during Insert, Update & Delete operation.
For e.g : If a record is successfully added into the database using the Service Layer then I should get something in the response like 1, 0, Incremented ID or new Object Key.
Same scenario for Update & Delete operation. So let me know your thoughts.
Currently, I have registered 1 UDO & performing CRUD operations through service Layer now every-time I am getting the blank response upon successful Insertion, Updation & Deletion.
So How would I confirm whether the object has been successfully added in the UDO or not.
Thanks
Rahul Jain
Hi Abhay,
Only the Add operation on Service Layer returns in the response body the full object you requested to be added.
Other operations like Update and Delete return an empty body response.
Nevertheless for all Service Layer operations you get a response status: "201 Created" for Add, "204 No Content" for Update, Delete,... in case of success or different error codes (3XX, 4XX,...) in case of failure. Based on the response status you can know if it was successfull or not and what is the problem. In case of success you can always send a GET request to double check the changes if required.
If you look at the Service Layer API User Manual: https://yourhanaserver:50000/ then click on "User Manual" link section "3.5 Create/Retrieve/Update/Delete (CRUD) Operations" you will be able to check the request and reponse format for each one of the entities exposed via Service Layer.
Hope it helps,Trinidad.
Dear Team,We are not able to copy the GRDC role template in BTP as the create role is greyed out. We tried to do it in Manage role section but no attributes are showing.

Dear Customer,
 
You can read about "Defining and Bundling Roles on SAP Business Technology Platform" for OP system on the following link: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_Group_Reporting_Data_Collection/e29950571a2b4065b1dacaf881c67413/c3401bd8e9354359a777b264d0b16309.html?locale=en-US
As a prerequisite for assigning roles to IdP users or user groups, you also need to configure role collections. A role collection consists of one or more roles from one or more applications and can be used to bundle authorizations within and across applications.
For more information on how to assign a role collection to a user group, see Map Role Collections to User Groups.

Hello,
We have some pdi code that is throwing error "Importing parameter STARTDATE is initial" when executing built in function "this.GetFromDB()". (The pdi code is written within EBO_ServiceRequest.xbo->root.node->Event-AfterModify.absl).

Hi all,
kind of a strange "requirement" or thing to ask, but maybe someone can give a bit more insight here. I'll first paint the picture of what is happening and what I'd like to archive. If what I ask for is stupid or unreasonable so be it, I'm just curious. I myself think that it is not possible but maybe someone else knows better!
We're within a custom, let's say report (doesn't really matter) and run through a process which registers some further processing in Update Task (not controlled by us so we cannot just hand over our values, registered by SAP Standard). We do not use "SET UPDATE TASK LOCAL". So a new separate session will be created. So far so good. Now after ending the main/previous session, the Update Task is executed. Somewhere down the line within this Update Task we run into a BAdI Implementation. In this BAdI I'd like to retrieve a value which existed in the previous session (the one that registered the Update Task to begin with). 
Now the question: Is there a chance to retrieve this value without previously persisting it somewhere? MEMORY ID, PARAMETER ID and things like trying to use a STATIC or Function Group "globals" (i.e. Top Include) won't work. Which makes perfect sense because we're in a separate session without any connection to what happened before and not just any kind of session as well. I wonder if there is any trick that'd work here?
Haven't used much Shared Memory Objects before but as far as I understood they wouldn't be the best solution either (due to: what if you have multiple Appl. servers). 
Any thoughts?

Hi everyone, I have PowerDesigner Repository -> There is two branches with Physical Data models (MAIN and DEV) -> in both branches is the same model (one table with one attribute).
Then I open DEV branch and RENAME attribute. 

Then I want to "marge" this change from DEV branch into MAIN branch. (Right click on Dev branch -> click on button "Integrate").

 Then I see settings window. 

If I leave Change list empty -> then I see change schema correctly.

and If I click on "OK" button, then change will be done correctly and everything is fine :) I have in MAIN branch wrong attribute name (ParTy) and in DEV I renamed this attribute to (Party) -> and made the integration between DEV and MAIN branches -> at the end I have correct name in the MAIN branch. 
BUT: I can not to do integration from DEV to MAIN branch without approvals. this is the reason why I need to create ChangeList. So in the integration settings window I set the change list (or just say "create a new one").

then again I see correct change schema (the same like in previous process). 

everything is fine and I click "Ok" - after that I can see change list. 

but if I (or some approver) open the change schema: 


then change is gone. 

no one can see that I did attribute renaming -> what approver should approve? and also it is not just about that change is gone in some view, but the change is really gone. Nothing happens after the change list is approved.
is it bug? or do I not understand something? because adding new attributes and tables works fine. the problem is with renaming. If I do branch merge without change list then everything is fine - if I use change list (for approvals process), then rename change is gone.

Hi all,
I'm binding the items of a table from the controller, but on doing this I'm getting an extra empty row in the table.
Then I found some references where they define an empty path in the items of the table like this and then as usual bind the data through the controller:

This way I don't get an extra empty row in the table.
Could someone please explain this behavior? And I've seen at many places where they define an empty path like above, what is the purpose of doing this?
I actually never came across this…. I guess this is to not bind anything as long as no data is available. As soon as the data is loaded in the json model they set the binding correct. The better solution would be to use suspend and resume in the binding: https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/b0f5c531e5034a27952cc748954cbe39
The documentation points to odata v4 but I also used it for v2 and I think it will also work for a json model.(to be validated)

Hello All, 
we have an issue where the AUC asset class has investment measure is active with Projects Systems (WBS) being used. The AUC was created with wrong asset class. one settlement to this AUC from WBS is executed. we would like to correct the entry and post the values to the right AUC. 
Since for investment measure is active, we cannot create a new AUC and assign it to WBS. One of the option was to change the status of 'Investment measure' to 'Line item settlement' in Asset class, create the AUC assign it to WBS. Then revert the config back to 'Investment Measure'. 
My question is it ok to change the configuration just to create a new asset and revert back? will create an inconsistency in the system OR do we have better option. 
Appreciate your repsonse.

Hi Experts.
I want to pass date range between today's date & next 30 days date while navigating from my custom app to a standard app.

Hi colleagues,
I would be interested on getting further details related to the technical shift that C4C developers will need in order to work with C4C version 2.
Is it expected to have JavaScript knowledge to work on side-by-side extensions which will integrate with standard C4C through API calls? Is this the approach that will be used?
Will SDK disappear?
Is the new way of developing expected to be as rigid as C4C or can we expect to have more freedom as we used to have when working with technical stuff on CRM?
Is anyone aware of when SAP will provide further details about this topic?
Regards.
Alejandro.

Hi   Alejandro Kinsbrunner 
As far as I understand there is NO C4C version 2, there is Sales Cloud version 2 and Service Cloud version 2, and both are diffrent systems.
For Customer specific extension we might have two options one is through AppGyver or SAP Build(they changed the name recently i think) and for complex developments SAP BTP Extension suite knowledge will be required, which has CAP(node js) and may be SAP UI5 expertise required( which means JS) also knowledge of Java and some other Web based technology is going to be very helpful.
SDK is not going to be used since that means inAPP development and Sales Cloud V2 or Service Cloud V2 are not based on ByDesign.
SAP will provide further details once they also have clarity, overall i feel there is many ambiguity over Cx Suite applications.
Hello everyone,I am quite new to SAP and I need some help how a potential solution could look like. We have a potential customer, which uses SAP HCM/HR on premise and we would like to synchronize their users/employees into our system. (basic user data such as name, email, location, team). The connection should be only in our direction. So we don't want to update their data. We just need to get the data initially and after that only if employees are leaving or starting at the company. (Is it possible to subscribe to changes?)So my question is, how we achieve that? I saw already other threads that our customer needs to publish a web service and we can then query it via ABAP. Is this the preferred way or are there any other better solutions?And secondly: is there any way to test this during development? As I can see SAP does not offer HCM/HR as a trial product. Any help or links would highly appreciated!
