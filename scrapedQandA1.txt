In the current configuration, we have managed to make all 6 activities un editable and it will propose planned activity qtys according to the partial confirmation of the order.
Is there a way for us to only block some of the activities and leave the rest of the activities editable to the user.
for example activity 1 - Gas, and activity 2 - electricity, I want to let the user enter these activities according to the actual meter readings. 
Note that not all my work centers have these activities and they are not always activity 1 and activity 2, in some workcenter, gas can be activity 3.
If non available material is present in sales order without rejection status , then material availability (1-03-2023)date during ATP check in ERP while saving is different from after rescheduling the sales order without any changes to 06-03-2023. Why?
Reason for my understanding  CASE 1: While saving SO without rejection status:
If any out of stock material is present in sales order during rescheduling( Document button) system performs backward scheduling, TM proposes logistic (scheduling) dates to ERP and ATP controller fails to confirm the proposed dates due to delay in material availability or (non-availability of material). So now system performs forward scheduling with pickup date provided by ATP as input and get revised dates from TM.
Here MAD during ATP check in ERP is 01-03-2023.CASE2: Rescheduling after saving:System proposes scheduling dated with the same behavior(backward + forward) as in case1 but it calculates with a new material availability date based on stock availability/ material condition at that point of time.(at the time of rescheduling). The variation of material availability date from case1 to case2 is completely based on ATP check in ERP system and not based on TM Scheduling.
Here Material availability during ATP check in ERP is 06-03-2023 but in case 1 is 01-03-2023. My question is why this ATP check MAD is different during forward scheduling in both cases?
Next question is during forward scheduling Requested pickup start date is present in RCCF log inder Input FU stages also different for forward scheduling in both cases.
What is the difference between Material availability dates during ATP check to this Requested pickup start date in RCCF log ? 
How PUDLV ( pick up delivery window conditions) condition comes into picture ln this case? How it affects the requested pickup start date in RCCF log and MAD during ATP check?
We are having trouble bringing up the Outbound Sync (Under Integration UI Tool of backoffice) on 1811 Commerce (Local Build).
We were under the impression that it has to be build on 1811 Commerce Cloud; however, in this webinar (https://enable.cx.sap.com/media/0_c5d5tt8x) at 19:43 we found that a local build version of 1811 Commerce also enable Outbound Sync (see screencap below).
Thus we wonder how this setup can be done? 

Hi, to enable Outbound Sync, you need to include the 'outboundsyncbackoffice' extension in your local extensions.xml. Let us know if you have any questions.
Thanks, Regina

Hi experts,
For compensation Executive Review, is there a maximum number of employees that users can download at once using the bulk print statement option. 
Is there any permissions that needs to be set up for users to select the below, some employees do not have the below option to "download a separate PDF file for each employee".

Hi ,
The maximum batch size for statement generation is 3000. This limit can be changed from Provisioning.

Hello Everyone,
Two sales orders, with different delivery dates, were combined into one delivery document.
Ship-to, shipping point, shipping condition, route, incoterms are all the same.
Please refer to more details below (using 5 work day calendar).
Appreciate your advice how sales orders with different delivery dates, be combined into one delivery document.

Delivery document copy control as follows.

Your feedback is much appreciated.
Best regards,
Yati
Hello Haryati binti Jaafar,
First create one delivery for one sale order in VL01N with selection date 01.03.2023 and save the delivery. Again go to VL02N and click on menu Outbound Delivery---->Delivery Sale Order (Refer screenshot) and on next screen enter your second sale order to add in existing delivery.
Please check and confirm.
Regards,
Neeraj Jain
Hello Neeraj,
Thank you for your feedback.
Hello Everyone,
The expectation is, for two deliveries to be created, as the orders are with different delivery dates.
But only one delivery is created, where it combined both sales orders, with tcode VL10I.
My question: Are delivery dates not checked, when SAP combines the two sales orders into one delivery?
Appreciate the feedback.
Best regards,
Yati
Hi , 
OCI extension is marked as deprecated from version 6.6 and to be de-released from Q2 2019 and there is mention of replacement extension with support for an up-to-date OCI version to be delivered as replacement solution as per deprecation status link https://help.hybris.com/1811/hcd/8bb15ed586691014a948d1553f4947cf.html
Is there any planned date by when the updated OCI extension will be made available ?
Thanks, Nivedita
Hi,I faced the same issue. OCI extension in OOTB was removed since version 1905.Unfortunately, at the moment there is no replacement and/or migration guide for it. you may need to consider implement similar feature via customization.
Hi,
I created a p-user and an account in sap universal ID. Works fine. Then I tried cf -login. I get a few times the {"error":"invalid_grant","error_description":"User authentication failed: UNAUTHORIZED"} and then the user is locked. {"error":"invalid_grant","error_description":"User authentication failed: PASSWORD_LOCKED"}.
I receive an email that tells me that the user is logged and I can repeat the whole process after 1h when the user is unlocked.
Seems that the password is wrong, allthough it works fine in the SAP Universal ID. Any Ideas how I can get the correct password to login to Canary - the p-user (email) has all necessary permissions in Canary.
Thanks Frank
Hi Frank,
as you are an SAP Employee (with either D- or I-User) but you also mention that you have a P-User I guess they are both connected to the same E-Mail address in SAP Universal ID. But for the cf login actually the "password relevant for legacy SAP applications" is used. I solved such issues by having all "legacy" passwords for the users sharing the same E-Mail in sync. You can do that via https://account.sap.com/manage/accounts in the details of a specific account via "Reset Account Password":

Not sure if that would work also with your SAP D-/I-User password.
Another option when you do an interactive login would be to use:

Dear Experts,
Kindly note that we are currently trying to to config Sap Customer Checkout for several SAP Business One HANA data bases using a single Integration framework (Cloud Control Centre concept) with in the application server . In this situation Can anyone advise how to use the Customer Checkout monitor function to monitor those data bases activities separately and Is there any other way around to fill this requirement accordingly . Thanks in advance .
Best Regards,
Tharindu Wijesinghe.
Hello Tharindu Wijesinghe,
you can use multiple B1i runtime users to separate different customers in B1. These runtimes users are assigned to the specific B1 DB with the system ID, which is set in B1i -> User administration. In CCO you just use the customers runtime user, then they can only connect to their assigned B1 DB for receipt posting & synchronisation.
See also the Solution Cloud in this note: https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2632210
This explains it quite well. 
Best Regards
Kai
Dear Gunther ,
Thanks a lot for your continues support on this query and yes finally succeeded the non cloud test run. Now can view the separate data bases result using different runtime users . Next about to try this with in the cloud control center environment . Thanks again for your assistance as always .
Best Regards,
Tharindu Wijesinghe . 
Hello  Tharindu Wijesinghe 
I am not sure I understand the question here. The integration currently works like this:
Accordingly, there is absolutely no touch point between CCOM and B1IF, so your question as to the implications of using CCC on the B1IF side has no impact at all on the way you implement CCOM.
If you want to know how to set up CCOM for multiple customers, please check the chapter regarding multi-tenancy in the CCOM guide. That way you use a single CCOM installation for multiple customers, each with different databases (or rather, schemas).
More details here: Using SAP Customer Checkout manager in Multi-Tenant Mode
Hope this helps.
Best regards,
Joerg.
Hello Joerg ,
Let me explain about my query further ,
It's like this we are having a cloud space call cloud control center for SAP Business One HANA . So in there we have configured several different customer's data bases (Normal Hana installation has 2 servers one Application and other one data base server but here adding another server called cloud control center it may replace with SLD and having privilege to manager user access separation as per the understanding) . So when need access to those different company data bases IT team providing separate access related only to particular company data bases for our clients . Even though there are several customers on board Cloud control center manage access to the data base separately using the SAP Business one installation in the application server . 
There for it is not several data bases for one customer and different data bases for different customers . We have installed two different sap customer checkout and two different sap customer checkout manager as well for two customers initially to test the scenario using different ports . So my concern is how to separate customer checkout monitor function for those two different customers because both customers are using the same checkoutB1i .

Hope this is understandable and could you kindly guide us on this .
Thanks and Best Regards,
Tharindu .
Hello Kai ,
Thanks for the advise on our above query . We are in the process of checking the same and could you please tell further which license need to be attached to this run time user to pass entries to sap business one.
Because as below we have provided license types to that user but below error coming in the checkout monitor preventing entry to be posted to the sap business one . 


Thanks in advance.
Best Regards,
Tharindu Wijesinghe.
Dear  Tharindu Wijesinghe,
Please refer to the help documentation:
For connecting to SAP Business One Cloud, the integration framework for SAP Business One must contain the document com.sap.b1i.vplatform.directory/B1OD/config.xml. In the case of problems, please check whether this file exists under the path specified.
Can you confirm the config.xml exists in the path specified above?
Best regards,
Gunther
Dear Gunther ,
Thanks for supporting on this query ,
The documentation link been provided cannot find in the help portal .
The mention file is not exist with in the said path here is the screen shot below for your reference ,

And please note that before going to continue this process with in Cloud control center we are checking this solution with in on-premise pc to get make sure we can view two different customers data base's sales data separately with in one customer checkout monitor . 
Could you kindly advise any thing we need to try and out on our environment further to get what we required . 
Thanks and Best Regards,
Tharindu .
Dear Tharindu Wijesinghe,
The config.xml file in path /B1iXcellerator/exec/webdav/com.sap.b1i.vplatform.directory/B1OD/ indicates whether it's a cloud system. Since your system is on-premise the config.xml is not there. This is as expected.
But for testing / simulating the cloud scenario you can just add the config.xml file in this directory. It doesn't need any content, it just needs to be there with this exact name.
Step-by-step description:
I just tested it myself - it works.
Best regards,
Gunther
Dear Gunther ,
Above advises are well noted and appreciate your support on this . Kindly note that I followed previously below steps to extend the said path to create the config.xml as you mentioned there again and did the above given steps as well but still it shows all transaction with out any difference no matter the user (Runtime or the B1i) . So we guess our WEBDEV connection was not established as required . There fore could you kindly advise how to do it properly and then we can try the same again accordingly . 
Thanks and Best Regards,
Tharindu .
Dear Gunther ,
Yes that's correct …! 
Kindly find below screen shots as requested ,
B1i Runtime users ---

B1i user login in checkout monitor (POS system CCO comes from SYSID - 0010000101 and TEST comes from SYSID - 0010000102 )

B1i_Runtime_1 login in checkout monitor --


B1i_Runtime_2 login in checkout monitor --


Guess from the below steps 3rd point not been done in our test environment so kindly consider that as well and please advise further how we can do it properly .

Thanks and Best Regards,
Tharindu .
I want to use the OCI-extension for hybris (version 6.6). I already managed to get it working and use the sample OCI shop.The problem I am facing right now ist that I cannot use the existing shop (derived from b2b-accelerator) together with the oci extension. I want to see our customized shop pages but keep the oci session. But when I call our pages after oci login my session gets replaced by a new session with anonymous user in it.Any hint on using the oci-extension with an existing shop or a link to further documentation would be appreciated. 
Cheers, Jörn 
Add the extension oci (under hybris/bin/ext-commerce/oci) to your localextension.xml. Then you can access it under [yourSite]:[portNumber]/oci/index.jsp

Hi all My client has the requirement to create the delivery document without sales order reference, and also the item in the document are not maintained in the material master.EX: An automobile manufacturing company wants to ship the equipment to the customer, however, the equipment is not maintained in the material master. How can I accomplish this, any answer/reply will be appreciated, thanks. 
Hello https://people.sap.com/yen586819
It's not feasible as without material you can't make a delivery. You can create non stock material if your customer doesn't want to create stock for that equipment.

Hello Experts,
In Workflow I am using custom UI5 application to load the Detail page. But In Inbox work Item Detail page is not loading on selection of master. It throwing error as "smart template rendering. Showing standard task in the detail screen as a fallback: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')" .

Can you please help,
Thanks & Regards,

Hi Rahul,
likely, in your UI5 component for the UI, you are accessing the property length, of a variable that has no value / is undefined. This is likely in code that runs when the component is initialized.

I am not able to connect to the service instance now when i try to connect from ADT to the cloud platform trial account it says 
"Cannot connect to your service instance.Please check your network and proxy settings." error.
I tried logging into the Could trial account and selected the service instances and when tried to open the dashboard it says 
"Service currently unavailable" error.

Hi Sijo john,
Since you have mentioned ADT I am assuming this is related to ABAP Runtime on BTP.
Have you followed the documentation on getting started with the ABAP Runtime:

Hello Experts. How and where do you change the profile interval length in SAP ISU? If the profile interval data is 30 or 15 minutes, how do you configure it to 10 or 5 minutes? Do you only change it in SPRO or do you also need to update or create new master data for it including modifications in tables or programs? Thanks. 
I am running an iFlow and when I go to monitor message processing and click on a message and go to the trace log and then message content, I am not able to see anything in message content for any step in the iFlow. I am using a trial version of BTP. Does anyone have an idea as to why this might be and how to fix so I can see message content?
Hello friends, my lead has given me 1 scenario. It's a realtime scenario.i need to tell a solution. Plz help me with this if you know. Scenario is like for ex RATL is a company which build highways and part of highway is gonna build by abc,xyz & RATL. But only RATL will procure material from vendor & then it will transfer to ABC & XYZ. But the problem is how we can transfer material from RATL to ABC? How will check stock consumed & remaining at RATL & ABC both level? 
Hello Srinivas Reddy,
You haven't described what is ABC and XYZ. I am assuming if these are your plants then you can transfer stock by standard STO process and if these are outside vendors then you can transfer the stock by standard sub contracting process. In both process you can check stock in MB52.
Let me know if any questions on it.
Regards,
Neeraj Jain 
Hi Experts,
I have developed and deployed a CAP application with List report Application (Fiori Elements) in it. I have an edit scenario (single record) in the list report.
 Now when I try to Edit a record and if I keep screen idle for a few min (<5 min), I am getting the following error:

Can anyone suggest me how to resolve this error.
 This error is not happening all the time, but intermittently it occurs. 
Do I need to maintain any configs in the application?
Pls do suggest a way to handle this.
With Regards,
Partha
Hi Partha Saradhi K J,
The only way to find out what is really causing the error is to reproduce the error and compare normal http request with the ones when it is failing. 
As a best practice while troubleshooting JavaScript based front-end applications such as the ones you code on SAPUI5 is to take a look at the requests on the 'network' tab. Usually you will look for errors like 401 on the list of http requests and try to make sense of what the app is trying to do versus what is not happening. 
For instance: find the request that resulted in error 401 and look at request query, header variables, cookies, etc. Try to reproduce the same payload the app is producing on the log outside the browser - I prefer using Postman, but you could certainly use other tools like curl to emulate the same payload. 
Maybe you are not getting an error on a batch request, but that request is failing due to invalid credentials due to an expired security token. 
Hope this helps.
Best regards,Ivan

Hi, 
I am using ADT in combination with SAP GUI 8.0 (32 bit) and it's working fine.
Do you use 64bit-version of SAP GUI?
I would propose to create an incident for SAP so that they can check the issue in detail.
Use the menu entry in Eclipse via "Help - Report Incident...". They will ask you in a first step for collective support information from your ADT-installation. This can be generated via menu entry in Eclispe via "Help - Collect Support Information".
I hope this helps you to solve the issue with the support of SAP.
Kind regardsJens

I need to assign a default field to custom license field via GRC request. Is it possible through configuration only?
I am in the process of creating a registration screen in CDC. This registration should work without entering a password, because the created users should be guest accounts (but should be created as full accounts and NOT as lite accounts). Social Login can not be used.
Currently I get the error message "Missing required parameter" with the error code 403007 when creating the account. I assume that the screen with Behavior = Registration requires a password entry. How do I make it so that this password entry is not required, so that the user is created as Full Account without password? These users should log in later by code without password.
Hi Agit Basibüyük,
The full account process will by default include the password registration and you can't even disable it in configuration. I recommend to use lite account only for your purpose and use progressive profiling.
Hope this was helpful. Thank you.

Hello Agit,
I had the same issue before, but when i was registering customers through the REST endpoint (register/setAccountInfo). What we did was generate a random UID as the password, this makes CDC happy and the customer doesn't get affected.
So i believe that you can do the same thing, using the java script in the screensets. Then use CSS to simple hide the password box OR remove it all in all from your screen.
Hi,
Is there a standard S/4HANA report that shows breaks down of material standard costs by material cost, machine, labor, overheads etc. 
Thank you.

Hi Ashraf,
It's standard function for material cost estimate.
You can check the cost componets view in the standard cost estimate.

Hello Experts, 
I have a question pertaining to improving a report I created. Thanks in advance for your time!
What I would like is to have the sum of my PO line items automatically display underneath the PO they are referencing without rolling the PO/PO lines into a hierarchy. The report is intended to be "no-touch" and a scheduled publication distributed weekly via emailed PDF. As such, I do not want to have to unroll it every week, as that would defeat the purpose of where I currently am (which is summing the lines individually, and also not ideal). 
A sample of my current version is below. The white boxes are covering sensitive information about the suppliers and pricing. 

What is the easiest way to have my sums populate automatically? I thought maybe I could use LOOKUP, which appears to work in execution, but is aesthetically unpleasing due to the repeating values. 

On second thought.... Is there a way to limit the repetitive structure (ex: PO 4500022629 shows 8872.48 only once in the Per PO calculation column)? A set-up like that would also suffice, although I'd prefer a horizontal orientation for the calculated sum. That being said, beggars can't be choosers!
Thanks again for reading and much appreciation for any assistance! 
Welp, here is how you answer your own question. 
So, the power of right-click never ceases to amaze me. For any other newbies that stumble upon this, add the itemized field back in as a displayed dimension in your report, and then right click on the column/row header. Do NOT click on an individual value, as you will receive different options. 

After that, you can change the orientation (top/bottom) in the builder. 

the last column is pressable. The event should be executed upon the metadata of the row. So when i click "print", i need to print only the data of one selected row.
oTable.getSelectedIndex(); is not working and oEvent.getSource() has no data.

 Pavan Kumar Jagadeesh 
Thanks-

Hi Abhishek,
Usage of COMMIT WORK / ROLLBACK WORK statements will cause the runtime error as RAP framework only manages it and also the update task or background task can be called in the late-save phase only. 
Ideally it would be better to validate in check before save and then call the update task FM in the save method of the RAP handler class in case of unmanaged RAP BO and also in case of Managed implementation with unmanaged save.
Please go through the below blogs for more details.
https://blogs.sap.com/2022/11/30/using-bapis-in-rap/
https://blogs.sap.com/2022/12/05/the-sap-luw-in-abap-cloud/#_ftn4
Thanks,
Pavan
RAP framework doesn't allow external COMMIT WORK. So you are getting the runtime error.
You are also writing the LOG using the FM which also use the COMMIT WORK.
For this kind of requirement where you need to use standard API. Create a wrapper RFC FM with the runtime data and call on background task so that another LUW will be started. ( This should be done in the save method ) in the implementation.
You can do whatever you want in that function module.
You can go for enabling the notification service which can be linked to the application log you are updating.
This will be a asynchronous solution. So once transaction is completed, the notification should be populated.
Notification service Link.
Thanks
Sagar Prusty
Hi Abishek,  
you should try to use the new released API's that are available to handle the application log.
Classes and Interfaces of the Application Log API | SAP Help Portal
These are also released to be used in ABAP for Cloud Development in SAP BTP, ABAP Environment and SAP S/4HANA, ABAP Environment. 
I have used this in my class that shows how to schedule an application job from within RAP. There the application job is configured to use a certain application log object.

All Activate content for Private Cloud can be found in the Roadmap Viewer here: SAP Activate Methodology for RISE with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition.
Hope this helps,

Go to SAP Activate Roadmap viewer, select the relevant roadmap for your project. Select the accelerators Tab. Here you will distinguish some but not all power point presentations bi looking the extension. i.e. Cloud Mindset Assessment_External.pptx
Unfortunately there are other presentations in powerpoint you will need to discover opening the accelerator itself.
hi all,

CALL FUNCTION 'RP_GET_HIRE_DATE'

 PERSNR = i_out-pernr
 CHECK_INFOTYPES = '0000'

 DATUMSART = '01'
 STATUS2 = '3'
 P0016_OPTIONEN = ' '
IMPORTING

 HIREDATE = i_out-hidat
 .


Thanks
Senthil bala
Hi ,

This is the example taken from this forum.

*Get the joining date of the employees
CALL FUNCTION 'RP_GET_HIRE_DATE'
EXPORTING
persnr = it_overseas-empno
check_infotypes = '0000'
IMPORTING
hiredate = it_overseas-doj.

If you search the forum by giving the name of the function module in Forum search , you will get one more HR related qn. other than yours.
In that, they are using this fn. module .

J.Jayanthi
Why cannot be used the function module HRENTRYDATE? (Sorry, for generic name, don't remember the exact name).
I am trying to download the CR for Visual Studio Runtime as well as a copy of Crystal Reports 2020, which we licensed through the SAP Store. Every time I click a download link (either by registering for a trial, or the Crystal download site), I get the below error. 
Because it was a single license purchased through the SAP store, I don't have an S account and can't request support from anywhere. 
You are not authorized to download this filePlease make sure that your company has purchased this software product. If you have a valid license, but still cannot download this file, please report an incident under component XX-SER-SAPSMP-SWC.
hi   Vivek Sharma 
 why don't you chat with CIC here
no my best solution but better than nothing :)
cheers!A
Thanks for the suggestion. Tried that earlier - was a hopeless conversation. Basically redirected me to posting on here, or to open a support ticket. Only downside is we purchased this as a single license from the SAP Store, so we don't have an S-account (and can't open tickets). 
By the looks of it, seems like an issue with the SAP download links. Because even creating a new SAP account and requesting a trial download results in the same error message. Hopefully they pick up on that soon and come up with a fix. Because otherwise, I'm not sure how to open a ticket or get the message out. 
I am looking at adding / implementing get right flags in our SAP system. I would like a pop up box to display where the representative has to check off the boxes for our contract review process. What is the process / own data code for adding this?
Boa tarde, 
Trabalho em uma empresa onde fazemos o corte de bobinas de aço que geram perdas por sobra de material e ponta de bobina. Tais perdas são esperadas e atualmente não possúimos forma de apontamento para tais.
As opções que tenho são:
1º Baixa por sucata - feita no centro de custo prejudica a área a qual está processando o material.
2º Baixa por inventário - Tambem baixada posteriormente no centro de custo prejudicando a área.
Minha duvida é: Como as perdas são esperadas, há alguma forma de realizar o apontamento de tais diretamente em um lote de produção? Ex: diluir a sobra de 1.000kg de aço em um lote de 10.000 veículos produzidos.
Caso seja possível, qual seria a forma de apontamento e transação adequada para tal baixa?
Can any body tell me how to solve this?

IT use to work before upgrading to Windows 11
I'm kind of desperate
Thanks you in advance
It appears you are using the .NET SDK which you can get from here:
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/Crystal+Reports%2C+Developer+for+Visual+Studio+Downloads
The latest version supports Windows 11, older version do not.
If you wrote the application you or the Developer will need to upgrade the application to SP 33 to be supported on Windows 11.
If you didn't write the app then you need to contact the makers and ask them to upgrade to SP 33 to be supported on Windows 11.
Are you asking to install a version not supported on Windows 11?
What SP are you using before Windows 11 upgrade?
I guess the alternative is to go back to Windows 10 or ask Microsoft to change Windows 11 so it appears to be Windows 10 along with rolling back all of the Windows 11 features....
And note Windows 11 does not include Paint by default, it's required to be installed:

Dear community,
I need to manage the customer factoring process in S/4HANA Public Cloud.
Description of the process :
Customers might be defined as "factored" (could be a status in the customer master data + the factoring company code). For each customer defined as "factored", daily or on demand, the system must transfer its invoices to a factoring company. That means that the invoices are paid by the factor company (minus an interest %). The risk is then transfered to the factoring company. 
Following transactions must be posted for the transfer :
Customer credit for the invoice amount. Interest GL account and Factoring account (both on debit). The factoring account works like a bank account.
The description above is an example
I did not find any scope item covering this feature, is there any workaround or bespoke stuf (in BTP ?) or any customer experience ?
Many thanks for support
PAscal
Hi Pascal,
I am not aware of a scope item that would cover this
However, it sounds like a perfect scenario that could be covered by InApp and Side-by-Side extensibility.
For the InApp, you could define a custom field for the Customer and enable it for some of the various APIs in the Custom Fields app

This would allow you to classify the customer as Factored or Not.
For the Side-by-Side, this basically means an externally developed application that interacts with S/4HANA Cloud via the Public APIs (S/4HANA Cloud API Hub). You could have this app developed in BTP and designed to run hourly/daily, etc.
I would expect the app would, via ODATA API calls
You will need to do some design to iron out the details so that the billing docs are properly dispositioned and proper journals are updated, but seems most of the pieces are there.
I hope this helps
Thank you

Hi ,
I tried to use table replicator with source as mssql and target as adl but I got the error saying create table access is not present . So how should I proceed now . Also suggest me if there are any other operators which will bring delta changes from MSSQL .
Thanks
Devang
Devang Sharma
Table replicator is designed to replicate data between two tables with the same structure. In order to use it to replicate data from an MSSQL table to an ADL table, you will need to ensure that the two tables have the same structure.

Additionally, if the source MSSQL table is not already present in the target ADL table, then you will need to provide CREATE TABLE access to the target table in order to create the table in ADL.

If you need to replicate data from MSSQL to ADL, you may want to consider using Azure Data Factory's copy activity. This allows you to copy data from an MSSQL source to an ADL sink. You can also set up a pipeline to monitor for changes in the source table and then trigger the copy activity to replicate the delta changes to the target table.
It sounds like the "create table" permission might not be given to the user defined in the target connection. Review the permissions required for the user in the operator help docs:
The following source-specific SQL Privileges are required. Ensure that the connection user has the following privileges:
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_DATA_INTELLIGENCE/97fce0b6d93e490fadec7e7021e9016e/79fcadb91f584f868a6662111b92f6e7.html
Please be aware that the tag 'SAP Replication Server' refers to another SAP product.

 Devang Sharma scroll down deeper in the help doc to see the items the operator will try to use: 
To capture the changes of a source table, a few objects are created in the source schema.

Hello,
Kindly follow the guides below:
For Urgent change "Import into Production" can be executed Via Status change i.e., from "Authorized to Production" to "Import into Production", In the backend TR Import gets triggered and TR gets imported in production and then the status gets changes these based on consistency actions such as Import_Prod.However for a Normal change it is executed via Task List. We want to enable Import similar to urgent change i.e. just by changing the status from "Released from Import" to "Imported to Production".We enabled Preliminary Import, That serves the purpose but we need to go through so many actions with this functionality.
How can we enable individual Normal changes Import Via Just status change?------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
Instead of using preliminary import statuses, you can assign the preliminary import actions to other statuses.

Hi experts. I am new to this program and having trouble with formula. I want to count each unique ID by year and if the year equals the current year then multiply that by 2.
I created a count variable and was trying do do something like this but I cannot get it to work. Any help is appreciated.

End result should be:
2019 = 5

2021 = 1
2022 = 2
2023 = 2

define the following variables:

v_COUNT:   =Count([Uniqueid]) ForEach([v_Year])
V_Final_Count:   =If ([v_Year] = Year(CurrentDate())) Then [v_COUNT]*2 Else [v_COUNT]

The issue can be there is nothing getting returned based on your RESULTLOOKUP(). Also the issue can be the other dimensions getting passed from scope to DATA() and the ones coming from RESULTLOOKUP() for same dimensions. You can create a variable member for Measure and put a code block like below and then diagnose the lookup section of your formula trace. That will give you some help.
Something like below. 

Worked out a similar example for you.
Sales Org parameter.

I have an Entity attribute defined in Sales Org.

I will try to copy the data for these 2 sales org from Actual to Budget
Please Note: MEMBERSET [d/SAP_CEP_ENTITY]=[d/SAP_CEP_SALESORG].[p/ENTITY] This is only helpful if you also have data against the sales org with Entity combinations which are not part of the attributes of sales org. Refer to Trace section below for details.
Output: As Expected

Insights from Formula Trace:

Sales Org parameter correctly picks up 2 selected values and the same is used as scope

Entity is scoped to 6 members and not only 2 . These are all possible values from attribute Entity from Sales org dimension and not only ENT0001 and ENT0002 (Entity attributes of passed sales org values)
Hope this helps !!
Nikhil
Nikhil AnandAnand, Thank you for the detailed explanation.
Let me put it in this way. 
Product dimension has attribute called Product and the value is same as Product ID.
For ex:
Prod ID Product
P001 P001
Material dimension has attribute called Product and value is same as Product ID.
Material ID Product
M001 P001
M002 P001
M003 P001
How to scope Material dimension in case of above scenario?

Do we have value quantifed for integration between S/4 and other solutions could be like EWM, IBP, SCSF, ARIBA, etc. ? 
This is number one question from our customers but I can't find any content that clearly shows the value of integration. 
Hello Carroll,
you may check out the ASUG & SAP survey about the state of integration among SAP customers which describes the benefits of integration: ASUG Survey - The State of Integration Among SAP Customers
Best regards,
Katrin 
Hi Katrin,
Thanks for the response; however, I don't see any quantified value in this ASUG document. I would like to see, saved 20% on implementation time, maintenance overtime for integration between EWM and S/4 is 30% lower, integration across systems enables process 1,2,3 to flow automatically saving one headcount per 1,000 sales orders. 
Does that make sense?

Hello everyone,I have a task to create custom report that will list the documents from VBRK table. In selection screen I have several parameters. Now I need to add one more parameter that should filter the search by a data that is on the Account assignment car of the sales order for that document. However, that data is in COBL-AUFNR field. Since COBL is not a table, I cant get the data from it. Do you have any suggestions on how can I get the COBL-AUFNR data for any of the documents. The main question: In other words how to find out what actual table (THAT I CAN LINK/JOIN TO VBRK/VBRP TABLES) contains that data.I may not be clear so here's an example: 
I have a sales order with Order ID: 3809

In every line item in card Account assignment there is a field labeled "Order": PS3938 (when I go F1 I see that's the COBL-AUFNR field) 

There is a document with ID number 90007876 that I can connect to Sales document 3809 since there is a column that contains that data.

I now need to put a parameter in selection screen where someone will enter "PS3938" and get 90007876 document (along with all the other documents that in their sales order have PS3938 in any of the lines of the sales order) listed in the report. That's why I need to find what actual table contains that data, and I have to be able to connect that table with VBRK or VBRP tables. Hopefully I was clear enough and there is a good soul that will help me find the solution. Best regards to all!
Hello Bojan Ivanovic,
The AUFNR field already placed in VBAP table and you can get order# itself from VBAP table and build your logic. 
Let me know if any question on it.

Hello all, 
Is it possible to customize the Learning History tile field to include item revision?
Currently it only shows Completion date, Title and Status and you need to hover on the Title and click View Details to check the revision number. 
Thanks! 
Hi Gwen,
there are no configuration options for the learning history tile available. As you correctly state the only way to view the item revision is by navigating to "View Details" page and verify the revision number and date.
A possible workaround could be to use the learning history report, the report includes by standard the item ID including revision number and date.

Service Plans and Quota assignment for SAP BTP IAS. Need help with Service plans and assigned quota. SAP Documentation does not provide concrete information.
I have referred to Online Help for BTP and IAS. The information given for Service Plans, Quota assignments etc. is not complete. 
Please find attached 2 screenshots for which I am looking for more information.
1. Service Plans like Standard, Lite, Custom, Default etc. What is the difference between them and how do they differ in cost? Then in Subaccount, the Service Plans are Application, Default etc. 
2. Quota assignment like 1 shareable unit. Is that 1 unit shared between multiple Subaccounts?
For example, I see 1 Cloud Identity Services which has 1 shareable unit. Does it mean I can use IAS with one subaccount?
Then there is Quota assignment which is Limited. Could not find information for this too. Just one liner or 2 somewhere.
If I activate 1 service plan apart from Default, does it comes with a cost? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.

job-variant.pngjob-variant2.pngfiscal-period.pngDear Experts,
We have production order settlement job that runs every day which picks up any production order that has been tecoed the previous day. The issue occurs when the job settles the orders the day after the fiscal month end date the account posting date is reflected in the next months final day for example if the month end date is 19th feb and order is tecoed on 19th feb when the job runs on 20th feb the account posting date is coming on next months period end i.e 27th of March.
This is causing issues when doing reconciliation since posting date and order completion are on different months.
And note that this is happening for some months.
so please let me know if the system behaviour is standard or if there is something that needs to be changed in the job variant. 
settlement.png 
Hi Pradeep,
Just thinking out loud, why cannot you setup a posting date as a variable for today's date in the variant for the job?
It is a standard behavior for the settlement program to use the last date of the period as default posting date, unless you specify otherwise.

Hi Gurus,
I don't see SAP ASE Edge edition listed in the price list anymore, only ASP is available. Did SAP remove edge edition? Is there any official announcement? 
This web page:
https://www.sybase-influential.com/sap-ase-edge/
says,
"Sold exclusively through SAP partners like Influential, SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise, Edge Edition provides the same benefits as the ASE Enterprise version with just a few select limitations and restrictions"
The best technical discussion of ASE Edge (that I found) is at:
https://www.doblerconsulting.com/sap-showcase/sap-ase-edge-edition/
Basically, you're still limited to 8 cores, but connections aren't limited to 255 (which is great!). Somehow, this makes the Edge license more cloud friendly. 
As far as I can tell, there are no prices posted online for Edge. You have to call a SAP partner to get a price, which in my organization means it has to go through management & purchasing to make the price inquiry, which means it won't happen.
Ben
We heard from a sales rep that SAP will support old Edge Edition licenses, but they're no longer selling new ones.

Hi Professionals,

I like to clarify if the following is correct:

1. Sales Area Must Be assigned to Sales document type.

regards
John
Hi,

No need to assign the sales document types to sales areas if you want to keep all the document types are eligible for all sales areas.

If you start to assign the sales document types to sales areas; then you have to assign all the respective sales document types to the concerned sales areas.

Regards,
K Bharathi
For these sort of question, better try creating a sale order by not assigning the sales area to that sale order type.  You will get the answer.  Please try to avoid posting such question for which you yourself can easily find the answer.

thanks
G. Lakshmipathi
Hello John,

Sales Area is the set-up that combines sales organisation, distributional channel and division

 By setting up Sales Area: You can define materials belonging to which divisions can be sold thorough specific Distribution Channels such as Whole-sale or Retail.

You can control specific transactions based on allowed document types.

So the assignment is necessary to sales organisation, which will control the sales documnet type.

Br,
Tushar
Hi

By assigning the Sales Documents to Sales area you can control the various do types which can be used for that sales area.

And it is a must in order to create any sales docs.

Prashanth
YES. that statement is CORRECT.

hi

my BOSS lakshmi pathi sir is right

adding some points to John

yes your are right 

you will assign in SPRO to restrict other sales areas not to work with the sales document type.

you will assign the same n pricing procedure determination as well for getting the correct pricing procedure in the sales document

hope this clears your sise

Hi John,


1. Sales Area Must Be assigned to Sales document type

-as far as the logic for this goes ,
its main relevanmce is to limit the sales document type to the sales area is that the end user does not create a sales order ,
for another sales area in your sales document let for ex-

there is a sales area for whole sales and one for retail.
now you have configurerd the ywho sales doc type for whole sales- sales area and yret for retail sales area.

now if the user creates the ywho sales order in retail sales area there will be process related problems for despatch guys so in order to limit this error and hassle, there are the ales area specific sales document types and can be configured as earlier told by gurus

revert if helpful

Hi
The sales document type should be assigned to the sales area to activate the document type to that particular Sales area in SAP and these are basic-level questions.

Hello everyone,
during an integration test we noticed that Strategy Group 10 (make-to-stock production) seems to be related to requirements type "KSL". However, these requirements are not taken into consideration in an MRP run. Only when I manually set the requirements type in the sales order or in the delivery schedule from KSL to 041, the transfer of requirements works as usual. I cannot find any Customizing for this and I have no insight into the corresponding tables. How can this be solved?
Thank you! 
Dear Katja, 

you question is more related to manufacturing. 

Strategy Group 10 is for planning with Planned independent requirements. It does not take sales order requirements into consideration. So it is purely Make-to-stock production. 

Please set strategy group to 40 in Material Master, this takes PIRs and Sales Orders into consideration. Please be advised, that a change of strategy group is not applied to existing sales order.

Hiya, 
I've been scouring the API documentation trying to see if this is achievable with no success so far, so hoping someone has a solution/ the documentation. 
I am trying to implement within SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone a number of transactional UI cards that allow an employee to submit data changes such as a change in working hours directly into SF. 
However, imagine there are some business rules on that sort of submission related to specific dates that we don't allow people to submit a change in working hours. 
Sure, the upsert request fails with an error but the requirement is to stop people from even submitting by getting the business rules on the front-end and limiting the date picker / warning them before submission.
Is there any way to grab these rules from SF? Or am I stuck with dual maintenance.
Many thanks,

Buen día expertos!

Deseándoles a todos un feliz año nuevo, les comento la siguiente inquietud agradeciendo de antemano el apoyo.

Esta pasando con la persona encargada de imprimir los cheques para el pago, que ya no le esta apareciendo la ventana de confirmación que te dice que folio sigue y te confirma de impreso el cheque en cuestión.
Es decir, solamente imprime el cheque y ya, tenemos que volver a abrir el cheque para el pago, para ver el folio asignó (afortunadamente hasta ahora el consecutivo corre sin problemas).

Espero haberme explicado bien, y agradezco cualquier idea para solucionarlo.

Saludos!!!!
Si estas leyendo esto y tienes el mismo problema, ya encontré la solución.

En el modulo de Gestión de Bancos > Pagos efectuados > Cheques para el pago

En la ventana de Cheques para el pago, a un lado del botón de cancelar hay un check que dice "Imprimir en papel en blanco", ese debe de estar deshabilitado para que aparezca la ventana de confirmación de cheque.

Hello all,

I read some blogs and questions I could found on this subject, but I with no success on fixing my issue.
I could create successful automation cases using SAP GUI, UI5, Web, Excel, etc. Now I am facing difficulties with SAP WEB GUI screen, I’ve tried to solve my issue in several ways without success. I would like to share my problem to see if somebody had a similar issue and how it was resolved. Any ideas are very welcome.
I’ve added all needed dependencies to my project. Then I am doing the following steps: 1) Create a new application. 



1) 2) Found my desired screen, it shows as IFrame. Selected that and click on Next.

3) I want to do a manual capture and declare elements. I also tried to record that, but the record was not able to capture anything. I also want to mention that only Web technology is available.

4) The screen was captured successfully. I clicked on Go to Application.

5) It comes with Framework = WEB. With WEB it does not work.

a. I changed to SAPWebGui

1) 

 b. It does not let me to declare elements, it shows in red like below.

Just an observation: I also tried using Framework = SAPUI5. In this case I was able to declare the fields, however when testing it, nothing happens in my screen. It is like the system does not recognizes the fields.
Thanks.

when i create vendor in sap s4 hana mm through BP transction, after creating BP no, then transfer to FLVNOO then vendor no. not show , while no. range is internal
Hello Prashant,
Do you have any other information like error message or something?
If the number range is set to "Internal" and the vendor number is not being assigned, it could be due to a few different reasons:
Incorrect number range assignment: Check if the number range for vendor creation is correctly assigned in the customizing settings
Incomplete vendor data: Make sure that all required fields in the vendor master data are filled in. Some fields, such as the vendor account group, are required for the number range to be assigned.

Hello,While navigating in the SAP instance (SAP Gui), if we use the F4 search feature, we get an error message (see below). 

"Internal error - Table format"Is there anybody who has this same issue ? Any idea on how to correct this ? 

Best regards, 
François
Hi Francois, 
I cannot reproduce the error in one of our reference systems.
Could it be an issue with your SAP GUI version ? 
I successfully used SAP GUI 7.70 SP4 which is also installed on the remote desktop of the appliance (can you try there ?). 
Best, Joerg

Hello Joerg,
indeed, I connected as well through the Remote Desktop option, and I don't have the problem while using the SAP Logon 770 installed there. So my own version level is not high enough apparently.
Thanks for your feedback,

Hello,

I have an ABAP program, which has, as the first screen, parameters. When I hit 'enter', the second screens appears.However, when I click 'Back' it doesn't return to the selection screen.

Here's what I have:

SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF BLOCK b1 WITH FRAME TITLE TEXT-001. PARAMETERS aux TYPE string. SELECTION-SCREEN END OF BLOCK b1.  AT SELECTION-SCREEN. CALL SCREEN 101.

MODULE STATUS_0101 OUTPUT. SET PF-STATUS 'STATUS'. SET TITLEBAR 'TITLE'.

 "more code...

ENDMODULE.

MODULE USER_COMMAND_0101 INPUT. IF sy-ucomm = 'BACK'. FREE: oref_custom, oref_alv. LEAVE SCREEN. ENDIF.  IF sy-ucomm = 'EXIT' OR sy-ucomm = 'CANCEL'. FREE: oref_custom, oref_alv. LEAVE PROGRAM. ENDIF. ENDMODULE.

I don't know how to call the first screen again, since I didn't actually created it.
Thank you very much in advance.
Hi,

The following statement should help you to return to the selection screen of the transaction which was used to start the transaction.

LEAVE TO CURRENT TRANSACTION.

Cheers,
Arindam
Try using Leave to screen 'XXXX'.
HI Rafael,


   CASE gv_okcode.    WHEN: 'BACK'.       leave to SCREEN 0.


Regards,

Try classic syntax like LEAVE TO SCREEN 0, or SET SCREEN 0. LEAVE SCREEN or even LEAVE TO CURRENT TRANSACTION. Read also some documentation like Screens, Screen Sequences.

Hey the best way to use is to use a "S" message and give leave list-processing.
Hello everyone,
Whenever I send an email from the BODS using SMTP function, some default messages will be printed before printing the actual body of the email. Default message is as shown below.
Mail from: </job name> sent at: < date time >  Message:=======
< email body >



Please suggest if there is any way to remove these default messages.
Thanks in advance.
Greetings Vijay Shankar,
Based on the above description, i assume you are using smtp_to() function to send the emails. This function will use the smtp_mailer.exe email client which unfortunately does not offer much customization. 
You however do have the choice of using other mailing clients if you wish to have more customization options.
Best Regards,
Joseph
Hi Vijay,
You can use powershell script by calling it in Data Services instead of using SMTP function. Powershell script won't print the default message in email body.
Thanks,
Vijay
I have two Crystal Reports (.rpt) files on a network drive. I would like to upload these files to my Google Drive and use Google Drive for Desktop to access/open these files. When I open the G: drive (created by Google Drive for Desktop) and try to open one of the Crystal Reports files, I get the following message titled "Crystal Decisions":
"The Microsoft Layer for Unicode (unicows.dll) can not be found. This program will now exit."
If I copy the Crystal Reports files to the network drive, I can open them without issue. Anyone have any advice for storing Crystal Reports files on Google Drive and opening them using Google Drive for Desktop?
Isaac Blasiman
The Microsoft Layer for Unicode (unicows.dll) is a system file that is necessary for certain programs to run correctly on Windows operating systems. Unfortunately, if this file is missing or corrupted, the program will not run and will display the error message you mentioned. In order to fix this issue, you need to reinstall the unicows.dll file on your computer. You can download the file from Microsoft's website and install it on your computer. After that, the program should run correctly again.

Hi, 
We have requirement to update partner city in contract ( VA42 ) using BAPI_CUSTOMERCONTRACT_CHANGE. It is working as expected but remaining address fields except city are updating with blank including email address. 
Can you please suggest a solution? how we can update only city without touching the remaining fields.
Sample code: 
 APPEND VALUE #( DOCUMENT = LS_DATA-VBELN ITM_NUMBER = LS_DATA-POSNR UPDATEFLAG = LC_U PARTN_ROLE = LS_DATA-PARVW P_NUMB_OLD = LS_DATA-KUNNR P_NUMB_NEW = LS_DATA-KUNNR ADDR_LINK = LS_DATA-ADRNR ADDRESS = LS_DATA-ADRNR ) TO LT_PARTNERCHANGES.

 APPEND VALUE #( ADDR_NO = LS_DATA-ADDRNUMBER CITY = LS_DATA-CITY1 ) TO LT_PARTNERADDRESSES.

 LS_CONTRACT_HEADER_INX-UPDATEFLAG = LC_U. " Call BAPI for Contract change. CALL FUNCTION 'BAPI_CUSTOMERCONTRACT_CHANGE' EXPORTING SALESDOCUMENT = LS_DATA-VBELN CONTRACT_HEADER_IN = LS_CONTRACT_HEADER_IN CONTRACT_HEADER_INX = LS_CONTRACT_HEADER_INX* LOGIC_SWITCH = LV_LOGIC_SWITCH SIMULATION = P_TEST TABLES RETURN = LT_RETURN PARTNERCHANGES = LT_PARTNERCHANGES PARTNERADDRESSES = LT_PARTNERADDRESSES.
Thanks in advance,
Venkat.
Seems you must first fill PARTNERADDRESSES with current values of address (check ADDR_CONVERT_TO_BAPIADDR1 or BAPISDORDER_GETDETAILEDLIST?)

Hello experts,
I'm facing an issue with ListPicker control of SAP MDK 6.3.5 when it runs on Android.
The problem is that the ListPicker doesn't provide any bound OData data. Use Case: Items from OData EntitySet are bound as target to ListPicker and the ListPicker provides a list of them. When selected i would like to get all the data (some more properties) behind that entity to prefill other ListPicker controls on the same page.
The MDK ListPicker reference states that this should be possible via TargetPath ending on #SelectedTarget (or on #SelectedRow for at least the index of the selected item in list) but this doesn't work for me. Also binding property is undefined for the ListPicker control.
Here you can see part of the page with corresponding ListPicker:

In the OnValueChange handler i then cant use something like:
pageProxy.evaluateTargetPath("#Page:-Current/#Control:VehicleListPicker/#SelectedTarget");
I debugged this thoroughly but no chance of getting the vehicle item's data in that case.
I mean this should work like that right? Or do you see any issue here?
I can work around this issue with OData ActionResult but it would be way more convenient to use it as stated in API reference.
Please help. :-)
Best Regards,
René
I have not used those target paths you mention before myself.  I will have to look into them.
Today the best option is probably to do an odata read to grab the full data of the selected item. We do also have a backlog item to better expose that as part of the return value but I don't have a timeline on when that will be added.
I would suggest checking (and logging if not there) the influence site for this request as well to help prioritize it.
Hi experts,
I´m using SAP BTP destination REST API Integration on SAP Build Apps, usually, I create a data entity with the "Create" operation, then, I configure the query on this section:

Previously, I only used the relative path to consult data, like this: "/PerPerson('" + query.record.d.personIdExternal + "')", and I called the values like this:
I assigned the values to a data variable and i can show them normally on the UI canvas, how ever, now I need to make a query with two filters, like this: 
"?$filter=externalCode eq '" +query.record.externalCode+ "'&$select=startDate,externalCode,name,description,status"
The test shows me the correct data:

Pitifully, I can´t show that values on my UI Canvas and I don´t know why, i had to make a manual schema because the test didn´t autodetect that from response, the schema is this:

So, I need help to use the data from the filter query, 
Thanks.

In our nodejs CAP application we use the minimalistic logging facade.
It does what it's supposed to do. But when it comes to Kibana and Request Correlation it doesn't.
As you can see in the following screenshot IMHO it should set the correlation_id with the one it wrote to the log message and that's used in the request (upper table).
Did anyone succeed with this? Is it an error? Do I misunderstand the documentation?


I am extracting Sales Document Item data by using 2LIS_11_VAITM from R/3 to BW. After extracting, I found that values of several fields are different between the source documents and the result of extractor in some records. I recognize that 2LIS_11_VAITM are directly extracted from mainly VBAK and VBAP through Delta queue.
For example: 
・Some values of KZWI1 - KZWI5 (Subtotal1-5) are 0 in VBAP whereas the extractor result is more than 0.
・AEDAT(Last Changed On) is 2015/06/28 in VBAP while 00000000 in the extractor.
Debugging 2LIS_11_VAITM with rsa3, I couldn't find any extractor logics for KZWI1 - KZWI5 or AEDAT in MCEC_BW_LO_API. I have no idea what causes the difference in values.
Is this because there are some kind of logics to manipulate values when VBAP data is put into Delta queue or Delta Update for the Sales Document Item didn't work? 
Thanks.

In SAP ECC I have planned independent requirements and requirements field. the PIR is for forecast and the requirements are for preplanned customer (schedule) orders. When one of those schedule orders is converted to an outbound delivery, does that only come off the requirements or is that consumed from the PIR also. There is no planning strategy set up in MRP 3 if that helps.

Hello All: 
I recently added a start and end book page in my demo simulation. The settings are w = 1200 and h = 800. During a local playback the width and height are fine. After publishing and playing the simulation, the width and height of my title and image have decreased in size. The title has moved from the right end of the slide and is positioned to at least 75% of the page. The image that was on the bottom of the slide has moved up about 25% from the bottom. The simulation pages are w = 1386 and h = 784. I created two new book page templates to match the simulation's slides width and height and republished. The same error occurs. Can anyone please assist? Thank you.
Hi Benjamin,
When playing back content on Manager, it's important to ensure that the content is published but also the templates used to create the content and the Resources.  Please ensure that everything is published and try again.
If the issue remains after everything is published, are you using a different monitor to playback the content locally to the one used to playback the published content?  You can have Enable Now automatically adjust the size of the content, i.e. make it larger or smaller, depending on the monitor used for playback.  To use this feature, set the Zoom for Desktop Playback and Zoom for Mobile Playback settings to Zoom to Fit for all relevant Simulation types and republish the Playback Settings object in Resources.

RegardsShane
Hi Shane:
Thank you for your detailed response. I am publishing the course as a SCORM through the Producer. The issue I face is only occurring on the start and end book pages in the demo simulation.

When I select the Trainer's previous icon, then I get what you see below. I appreciate your feedback. Thank you.

But their attributes are shown like this in the target element:

I tried changing their name in mymodulecore-locales_en.properties:
type.Videogame.publisher.name=Publishertype.Videogame.developer.name=Developer
type.Videogame2PlatformRel.videogame.name=Videogamestype.Videogame2PlatformRel.gamingplatform.name=Available Platforms
But that doesn't do the trick. How can I change it?
Thanks in advance!
What you did was correct, did you already do update system with localized types enabled? If no please do update system with localized types enabled, and then restart the server.

Hello Team,
I wanted to check if anyone is able to setup/customize the Contract Approvals in the manner below. Currently in Ariba, when a Contract Workspace (CW) is created for lets say $5M Approved Budget amount, it goes to 4 approvers based on the approval limit. When this CW goes for an amendment for another $1M, the total Approved Budget amount now will become $6M. As per the standard Ariba functionality, all 4 approvers who approved the initial version will again need to approve the CW. Can some one please tell us if any of you have seen/worked on the below scenarios and how it was achieved.
1. Our business wants to trigger the approval flow only the increased approved budget amount i,e in the above example, the first amount is only increasing the CW amount by $1M, so it should only go for approvers who can approve CWs up to $1M.
2. Also, during multiple amounts, we use the same field, Contract Approved Budget amount, in terms of reporting, how can we capture what was the approved budget amount in the previous versions of the Contract Approved Budget amount? If am not wrong, the current reporting facts cannot help us with looking at different Versions/amendments of the CW and give the details of Approved Budget Amount for that particular amendment or version of the CW. On each and every version/amount, the approved budget amount in reporting shows only the current value.
Thanks,Velu

Dear all,
We used to control the visability of tiles by separating the tiles from the target mapping like it is described in a blog of Carola Steinmaier:
SAP Fiori Launchpad – Control Visibility of Tiles by Separation of Tiles and Target Mapping | SAP Blogs
Now we moved to FES 2020 where we can use spaces and pages for even better structuring our FLP. So far this works fine.
As we have 100+ apps and around 30 differen business functions to migrate from SAP portal to FLP we would like to use the same procedure with separating tile from target mapping. This also works fine for the tile itself and for sections of pages but it does not work for the page itself nor the space. I.e. even if there is not a single tile on the page or space, the pages and spaces will still be displayed... whereas groups which do not have a tile are completely hidden.
Is this a bug or are there ways to hide empty pages and spaces? Are there perhaps other concepts to achieve this?
Thanks in advance and regardsGabi

Dear All, 
I am checking the discount functionality in SAP Customer Checkout. We are working with SAP Customer Checkout Manager as a backend system.
I can see that, when we create a customer in SAP Customer Checkout Manager, it is possible to assign a discount percentage to this customer, that is later synchronized with SAP CCO and automatically applied in the receipts for that customer.
When the customer is created directly in the POS (NOT in SAP Customer Checkout manager), I dont see the field where I can indicate the discount percentage for that customer. Is this only possible in CCO Manager?
Thank you so much.
Kind regards.
Hi,

In the PA30 Screen, Infotype - 0006, when the user is updating/creating a Subtype, concurrently another Subtype under the same Infotype must get updated.

I used the FM HR_INFOTYPE_OPERATION in a separate report and Submit this report in the Exit. the database ( Pa0006 ) updates properly.
The problem is that after Getting the message "Record Created", when I go into the Overview Screen or directly click the "Display" icon, the subtype which was to be updated through the exit doesn't show the new value under the subtype at that time. However when I go for "Change" icon or when I come out of PA30 and see again, the values reflect properly. 
I have tried NOCOMMIT under HR_INFOTYPE_OPERATION or even tried to use COMMIT WORK and WAIT separately.. None of this seems to be working..
Any clue??
Hi Varun,

This is because all the data is already there in internal tables of PA30. So it is not reading DB again to show the values. When you start the new session of PA30 or start the session in change mode(DB change will going to happen) then you get your updated value.

Regards,
Atish

Hi ,
I am using CAP for build an application on HANA Cloud. I have used CSV file to do some testing. However, while deploying to production, i want to ignore those files?
Is it possible by some configuration (for example in Package.json)?
Regards,
nitin
The better solution might be to move the CSV files containing test data to the folder test/data. cds watch is loading CSV files contained in the test folder by default while cds watch --production does not. Same holds true for production build and deployments, e.g. cds build --production, cds deploy --to hana --production. 
Make sure that CSV files intended for testing aren't deployed to production by mistake as this would impact subsequent HANA deployments.
See also [providing initial data](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/databases#providing-initial-data).
Hi Nitin,
I don't know if our solution is the best one (wait for other answers before accepting this one :) ), but we solve it by adding the following lines in the mta.yaml:

I have a set of ASP web pages that have worked for years. I have had them installed and working on one of my customer's server machines, also for years. Two events occurred within weeks of each other: My development machine got destroyed by a glass of cola, and my customer installed a new server. I thought this would be a good opportunity to upgrade my setup to Visual Studio 2022 and install the latest version of Crystal Reports, SP33. Let me state that these programs work fine on my development machine, and state again that the programs have been working fine on both ends for years.
The programs all work with the same basic style: I go out and collect some data into an ADO dataset, then attach the dataset to a Crystal Reports document using a report previously developed against an XML scheme file created from the schema of my dataset during development.
The error occurs on the line:
 crReportDocument.Database.Tables(i).SetDataSource(dataset)
using a crReportDocument and a dataset created just prior. I get the error: "Error in file {report name}.rpt. Failed to load database information"
As everything works fine on my development machine, I feel it is most likely an environment issue. I have been working on the server, and have spent hours combing the internet and have tried every proposed solution I could find: Unloading and reloading the SP33 64 bit runtime msi program on the server (making sure to run as admin), installing the SP33 32 bit runtime as well, going into Control Panel and repairing both of them, uninstalling everything and installing VS2022 Community and the SP33 Crystal Reports Developer package, making sure the crdb_adoplus DLL is present, inserting the 'Legacy' entry into my .config file, but they all make it to the same point and fail when trying to set the ADO dataset as the report's runtime source of data.
Looking for anything else to try next.
Found the problem this morning. For some reason I had a copy of the file Crystaldecisions.Web.dll in my bin folder. I have no idea how, when, or why it was in there. It was the current version, but maybe things failed because the application couldn't find any of the accompanying files and gave up.
Thanks to all who offered help.
Hey there. Not sure if I fully understood the issue, but take a look at this one: https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2420739 might help. 
Could you add some info on the DB you are trying to connect to? Could you check DB client bit versions potential incompatibilities between client server etc? 
In the Crystal for VS wiki there are a couple of references to what you need to do to get ADO.NET datasets to work with newer SPs of the SDK - one in the SP21 release notes and one in the SP26 release notes.

LegacyMode is no longer required in VS 2022 and CR runtime, remove that from the config file and it should work again.
And I don't suggest going back to previous versions of the runtime, 1st issue is they used Flash for parameters which should have been removed from your PC so those will no longer work. There have also been Security updates which you should be using as well.
2nd is we don't patch this product, so use the latest, if the issue still persists we can escalate it for a bug fix.

Hello,
we have key users who have used query variants under NW750. Now we have upgraded to SAP BW/4HANA 2021. In RSRT the button “query variants” has been deleted. Is there any chance to locate these variants because they are user dependent?
Alongside we try to give the key users the authorities for the BW cockpit, but only for data display (infoobjects, hierarchies and queries).
But the SAP role SAP_BW4_REPORTING_USER has insufficient authorities (no tile appears in the cockpit), but there are no authority errors. The other SAP roles (BW/4HANA-administrator, authority administrator, modeler, operator, developer) don’t seem to fit for the keyusers. Are there any ideas? 
Otherwise we have to check all authority objects of the other SAP_BW4_* roles step by step.
 
Thanks in advance 

One of our customers has already integrated AN with S4 H thru CIG for SCC. Data Center Europe. The same AN has to be connected to the ECC system as well.
For the same customer , B&I is now activated and when CIG is enabled it is pointing to US Data center , with a new P User. B&I should be connected to ECC. The CIG which is enabled is not the one which is in use for AN-S4 integration.

 Questions... 

How can we use the same CIG for both AN ( SCC ) and B&I ? Ideally only CIG should be used to my knowledge for all Ariba Solutions.
Can we use 2 different CIGs for AN and B&I?
Why has it created 2 different CIGs here , is it because of 2 data centers?

Hi, if your customer already has integrations for AN with EU datacenter, you should open a case/SR to request the configuration of Buying in EU realm so you can have the 2 solutions in a single CIG/Integration Suite Managed Edition.
https://connectsupport.ariba.com/sites#item-view&/KB0406207
Important note https://connectsupport.ariba.com/sites#item-view&/KB0405508 there are no migrations from EU to US if you try to change AN integrations in this case, the recommendation should be to leave all realms in EU (since customer already have integrations here) in this case.

Hi, 
Wanting to know where a maintenance order can be searched to show data of unrestricted stock qty and requirment qty of the work order? Goal is to see this data so order can be sent to warehouse for them to pick if all items are available
SAP S/4HANA CLOUD 
Hello  Dave Sempf.
How are you? If I understood you correctly, you want to see the Materials needed in a Maintenance Order as Components, their Requirement Quantities and their Available Quantities, correct?
In this case, inside the Maintenance Order, for the Area/Tab of "Operation Data", you can go to Area/Tab "Materials" inside, where you can see the Required Quantity of a Material ("Quantity" Field and, through "Settings" Button (Gear Image), you can select also the Field "Confirmed Quantity" to check, respectively, if the Quantity is available.
Please check SAP S/4HANA Cloud Help Portal to see more information regarding Materials and Services for Maintenance Orders: Materials and Services | SAP Help Portal

Wir sind interessiert am Produkt Crystel Report und Crystel Report Designer.
Ich habe Fragen zum Produkt.

Muss für die Nutzung von Crystal Report und Crystel Report Designer Open JDK installiert sein?
Wenn ja, sind die Open JDK Lizenzen im Produkt Crystal Report und Crystel Report Designer enthalten?

 Gibt es eine Möglichkeit Crystal Report und Crystel Report Designer ohne Open JDK Lizenzen zu nutzen?
No, you do not need to have Open JDK installed to use the full version of Crystal Reports.  However, if you're going to create an application using SAP Crystal Reports, version for Eclipse, you will need to have some form of JDK.  That licensing is not included with the SDK.
You could potentially get around the need for a JDK by using the .NET SDK - SAP Crystal Reports, version for Visual Studio - to develop your application.
-Dell
The Crystal Report Designer comes with a shipped in JDK as far as I could find out. According to your response the software package of SAP uses an Oracle JDK. Since Oracle changed their license model I would like to know how SAP licensed their shipped in JDK.
CR actually comes with a SAP JDK because of Oracles Change. So it's included and no extra licensing is required.
Sir/Madam,

Can anyone provide me the questionnaire for FI / CO for making the business blue print. AS we are doing demo project on ACME company. ACME is in the manufacturing of Consumer durables & they are having 7 sbus & under each sbu they are having 17 business areas & under each business area they are having two plants & each plant contains three storage locations.

Kindly help me in making Questionnaire for FI/CO as i am making the business blue print for fi/co.


Thanking you.

This is wonderful and helpful Ravi
Hello,

If your client is implementing Solution Manager, you will have the standard questionnaire available.
Otherwise, if your implementation partner is having a different methodology, you will have to follow the same.

You can download the some available sample questionnaires from the net.

http://sapdocs.info/2008/12/19/questionnaires-for-business-blueprint/

In the similar way, you may have to develop a questionnaire.

Hope this is useful.

Dear all,
In one of our customers we are working with SL (Service Layer) 10.00.191
In that customer we have 2 SLES machines.
The first one (A), DB machine, has the Hana and Servertools (except SL) installed.
The second one (B) has the SL installed.
We noticed that in the SL monitor, there are one type of request that in 24 hours has more than 24k requests to the SL.
This requests are done by machine A (Hana) to machine B (SL).


I don't find anything about that type of request in Service Layer documentation. 
I need to know what is that request and if it is normal to have that massive requests from Hana Database to the SL Server.

Hi friends,
I have a measure which is set as percentage in the model.
In the Story I want to show this measure with a percentage symbol "%". but it isn't available. Check it out:

I simply want the symbol % showed in the widget in the left.
Kind regards,

Hello,
if the measure is coming from a model you need to go into the model and select the measure that you are interested in.
In the column SCALE you have the change to put Percent.
Best,
Maya
Hi Ismail,
Is your "Percent" scale measure a formula in the model?  Probably it does not matter if it's formula or not, in my example it's formula.
I've made a very interesting observation. If the "Percent" scale measure is displayed only in the table then it does not show "%" sign! But once any of the other measures added then "%" is displayed.  This is not case for charts, it's only happening for tables.
Only Percent measure:

Hi experts,
We are looking for best solution in SAP S/4 for health insurance company with large volume of documents (50 million items per year).
We are considering FIAR, FICA/FSCD.
FICA/FSCD aggregates items into the total records , which are transferred as summary to the general ledger. But business requirement is to have separate FI line items in G/L (BSEG, ACDOCA ), without aggregation.
From that reason we would like to use FIAR.
Is it a good idea to use FIAR on S/4 hana (with data aging for FI_DOCUMENTS) , for this volume of data, mainly from performace point of view ?
Regards
Jaromir
Hi Jaromir,
for this high volume of documents, you should use FS-CD. 
 
Hopefully the business requirement to have separate FI lines is only valid for some exceptional cases. 
In general, there is a direct drill down from FI G/L document to all summarized FS-CD subledger documents possible. If you still need line item per line item from FS-CD in FI you could control it on 
· document header DFKKKO-XEIBH:  If you select this indicator, the system will create a separate document in the SAP General Ledger for this FS-CD document. The number of the document posted in FS-CD is stored as the reference document number in the G/L document.
· Bp item DFKKOP- XEIPH: If you set this indicator, then another separate line item is created in the general ledger transfer document for this line item. This item is not summarized with other line items (as is usual when creating the totals records), even if there is identical account assignment.
· GL item DFKKOPK- XEIPH:  If you set this indicator, then another separate line item is created in the general ledger transfer document for this line item. This item is not summarized with other line items (as is usual when creating the totals records), even if there is identical account assignment.

Hello Experts,
I do have a Fiori list report developed using SAP Fiori elements. I need to dynamically change the column headings.
I have a filter called "Period" which can be selected as "Monthly" or "Weekly". When the user has selected the "Monthly" option, the columns should have headings for next four months, like:
03/2023 04/2023 05/2023 06/2023 
When the user has selected the "Weekly" option, the columns should have headings for next four periods, like:
Calender 09 Calender 10 Calender 11 Calender 12 
How can I achieve the same, possibly with custom JS code in the front-end? Especially for the one which developed with Fiori elements.
Hi, we have a scenario where, during a replenishment, a full HU is moved from high rack to a work center and a second WT is created on hold to move the partial stock from the work center to the picking area. We are looking a way to (after the confirmation of the second WT) get a third WT created automatically to return the HU from the work center to the high rack area. How this scenario can be achieved?
Thanks!
Hi Lucas,
are you aware of the functionality "Return Transfer" in /SCWM/PACK (Tab "Change HU")?
With that you can move the HU you have picked from back to the warehouse (manually as the picker decides when to move the HU).
In the settings of the work place (SPRO) you can define which storage type to return to and which warehouse process type to use for the movement.
Not sure whether that is the automation you are looking for, but at least the user does not have to perform an adhoc movement.
Best regards

Hi Experts,
we have a batch of CSV files in local system and would need to auto load the csv data to DWC system table.
can we do this via custom sql query and load into DWC ? or please let me know the ideal approach on how to automate the process of importing csv to datawarehouse cloud.
At DWC Roadmap a FTP based connection is planned for Q3 2021, and this option will allow to import CSV data with Data Flows.
At the moment it is not possible to do this automatically. There is no "CSV" connection type that allows remote access or use it in Data Flow. 
I have not tested it, but I think that an option, although complex, would be to use in DWC a JDBC connection, and to configure a JDBC driver to access CSV (there are paid ones and some open source). This would allow viewing the files as remote tables.

Other options are possible, but they involve using third party systems (HANA, Azure, etc) and access through these systems.
Dear All, 
I am checking the possiblility of assigning a percentage or fixed amount discount to an article in SAP Customer Checkout Manager vía API, so it can then be synchronized with the different POS that our customer has all over the country.
We are working with several price lists, since the same article can have different price depending on the city. 
For what I can see, in the Discount tab of the Article aplication there is no reference to the price list for discount. Is it possible to assign different discounts depending on the price list for the same article? Or the same discount will apply to all the price lists that are assigned to the article in the prices tab?
Thank you so much for your help.
Kind regards.

Hi,
I need to setup 2 house banks under 1 Company code out of 2 company codes available in same country.
Both house bank accept different Payment medium formats.
I configure the new Payment medium format PMF1 to a Country say C1 in T.Code: FQP1
Say, This country have 2 Company codes CC1 and CC2. 
In FQP4, for one of the Company codes say CC1, The Payment medium format is assigned but not for other Company code: CC2.
When run FPY1, i get the PMF1 in template ran for CC2 which is not expected. We still want CC2 to be executed with existing Payment medium format say PMF0? 
Please advise.
Hi Ashish,
payment methods in TC FQP1 have a 1:1 relationship to payment medium format from TC FQP3.
So you have to set-up one payment method for company code CC1 with format PMF1 and a second payment method for company code CC2 with format PMF0.

We have a MSA repication that is managed by 2 rep servers, we def8ned replication definition at RS1, and define subscription at RS2, there is a route between them every thing was fine, we needed to resync the replucation , so when we run drop subscription at RS2, it took long time for some reason, so we deĺete the subscription let's say sub1 manually from rs_subscriptions table at both RSSD1 and RSSD2
NOW WHEN WE TRY TO DEFINE A NEW SUBSCRIPTION, WE GOT THE FOLLOWING ERROR :

Hello Experts, 
We are in Utility Industry, currently using Cloud Integration (Iflows) out of BTP/CF for integrating back end ECC (on Prem) to SuccessFactors and C4C/SAP Service Cloud for customer service. Most of the iflows are standard but we have some custom as well. 
We are trying to analyze the use cases for API management in our use cases. Since publishing of API to third party and monetization of API is not relevant for us, what value can API management add instead of directly using iflows from cloud integration?
What additional benefit can we get by implementing API management and publishing all the standard and custom iflow? 
Regards, Sanjoy
Hi Sanjoy,
think about creation of a central library for all your APIs of your SAP Cloud landscape, having documentations and open API specs available on 1 central place, like it's with api.sap.com. 
Having that in place, you're giving other, not SAP developers, the ability to search and re-use your listed and published APIs for other internal 3rd party applications. 
Think about publishing an API to get CostCenter Details on APIM and someone in charge for an Azure Microservice who is doing bookings for rooms is search for a opportunity to get the owner-details of a CostCenter. This would be a central approach to have all "available" API's of your Cloud landscape in place. Also think about the consumption of different APIs based on their scopes and the ability to identify who is consuming and in which amount (don't think about money, think about data-capacity).
Hope this helps.
Kindly advice me when we have two replication servers how or when transactions fare removed from the primary replication server ?
In our case even transactions applied in the destination database, the queues not purg its content
It almost will be full 
Regards
Conditions that can lead to stable device space not being truncated/released:
Another, albeit rare, occasion would be orphaned rows in rs_segments (ie, rows in rs_segments with non-zero q_number values that do not have a matching row in either rs_databases or rs_sites); fixing this issue would require direct modifications of the RSSD tables and is not recommended unless instructed by tech support.
Here's a good writeup for how long log records (where typically each log record corresponds to a row that was modified) are kept in the primary database's transaction log:
Repserver Admin Guide 1 -> SAP Replication Server Technical Overview -> Transaction Handling with Replication Server -> Transaction Processing by the Replication Agent -> Coordinate Adaptive Server Log Truncation
help.sap.com/docs/SAP_REPLICATION_SERVER/9dc6170db0d24bb9bc901a44187b0636/fd461172bd1c1014a9eecd86e9290823.html
The key point is, the secondary truncation point marks the log record that contains the begin transaction command for the oldest open transaction not yet fully applied by Replication Server. 
Transaction log rows in front of the the secondary truncation point (later in time) can't be deleted. Once the oldest transaction commits to all the replicates, the secondary truncation point on the primary can be moved forward (to a more recent time), permitting all the trans log rows older than the secondary truncation point to be truncated.
I think the old transaction log entries don't actually get deleted until a periodic checkpoint operation runs in the primary ASE server. So there can be some lag between when the secondary truncation point moves and the transaction log rows actually get deleted. You can use "dump transaction <dbname> with truncate_only" to rush things (only truncates/deletes trans log rows no longer needed)
Hi experts,
We are working with ASR in S4H 2021 FPS2. We have direct distribution to EWM turned off because of the process of the customer. Now, when we create a delivery and save it, a freight unit is created. 
Then when we distribute the delivery to EWM via VL06D a second, almost identical, freight unit is wrongfully created in TM. This causes pollution in the system. We tried looking at the freight unit building rule, ASR integration but cannot find the reason behind the second created freight unit. 

This is happening after we upgraded form 2021 initial stack to the FPS2. Does anybody have an answer for this?

Hi
I hope someone can help me with a problem query.
I need a query that will pick up the sales order value before tax it also needs to show the SO number, Customer name and Code, the user would get a condition to enter the sales order number which is something like 25644 for example to bring up the information. This part is fine and the query is straight forward however, the query also needs to use a UDF called 'Inter Proj Num' which I've placed on the Sales Order screen.
 This will have another Sales Order number in this field and links to a sub project that may of been created when a customer wanted an upgrade / addition to the original sales order. 
So the query I need is for it to show the sales order info once a number has been placed by the user. If there is a number in the Inter Proj Num field as well it needs to look up that information as well and add that Sales Order amount to the total. As the two numbers will be for the same customer the customer details won't need to be duplicated.
For example:

Input sales order number e.g. 25455
Return sales order value where SO number equals 25455
Return sales order value where Inter Proj. Number is 25455
Above 2 items can be a total. They need to be exclusive of tax. Need

 I hope someone can help me fathom a way of getting this information together, it is much appreciated.
Hi,
Not sure it can be a total of the values for separate documents listed, but to get a query to show what you've asked, try this;
Though I think you might need to change '[U_Inter Proj Num]' for the UDF title, not the description...

Hello all,
The client wants to use NLAG material type (non stock, non value) for some of their purchases. I’ve created the Z* copy of the standard NLAG material type to be used.
If I am correct, by default, NLAG doesn’t have Accounting 1 view opened, right?
The request from client is in regards to the automatic account determination. When creating a PO with material that has material type NLAG, the account assignment is selected (K for example), but the G/L isn’t populated - it rather needs to be filled manually. If I understand correctly, this can’t be done because the NLAG doesn’t have accounting 1 and thus no valuation class, so it can’t automatically fill in the G/L. Client would want the automatic filling.
My question would be is it even possible to have automatic account determination in PO for NLAG (can we open accounting 1 view) or this is not possible?
Thanks 
Dear Aleksa Misic,
Indeed as NLAG isn't managed on value bases, you should not create accounting view for material with this mat. type.
Anyway you can maintain automatic account determination for materials without val. class.:
1) Check account modification for acc. assign. category "K"
SPRO->Materials Management->Purchasing->Account Assignment->Maintain Account Assignment Categoriess

2) Set G/L for materials w/o val. class in OBYC
Transaction OBYC -> transaction GBB -> General modification (acc. modification) from previous step (in this case "VBR") -> Valuation class "blank" (as for NLAG there is no val. class)

With this setting for all materials without val. class with acc. assign. category "K" will be automatically filed in specified G/L acc. during PO creation.

Hello Experts,
We have an interface which is triggered by timer event and pulls data from an API and volume is huge. This API returns 10k records in one call and give you next key(10001) to use in next call, so we have put a looping process call. During tests, we found that tenant runs into problem while processing over 400k records. Messages are stuck in processing status and run-time node restarts itself. So we put the condition in looping process to either run 40 times or when NextTableName = -1( no more data). Problem with this is that you have to wait for next runs to load the data in receiver system(sftp).
What we would like is that once this interfaces runs and finishes; then it runs again depending on nextKey value. It keeps doing that till there are no more records. Is it possible and what is the best way to achieve that?
Any suggestions are appreciated.
Thanks,
Hemant
You did not say if you have any mapping requirements for transforming the API responses. If not, rather than collecting the records in one run, you might want to append them to SFTP file and while there are more records, call the same iflow using a SOAP adapter in asynchronous mode (caller does not wait for the provider to end processing), with HTTP headers for passing parameters. You kick off the process using a timer, which triggers the iFlow and then keeps calling itself in separate instances until all the records are read. Now you have an SFTP file to grab and transform and send to receiver. However, you might want to do that using SFTP look up in the last run of the iFlow when you find there are no more records to fetch. You need to make sure the SFTP file is not too big for CPI to handle though.

Hello experts,we are just implementing the fiori My Travel and Expenses (Version 2) application.Does anybody know, how to disable the draft saving feature? I tried the following in manifest.json without success."sap.ui.generic.app": { "_version": "1.3.0", "settings": { "showDraftToggle": true, }}Thanks and regards
I'm not sure this is possible because if you want to add an attachment for example you already have to "presave" the expense note. Because it's not possible to link the attachment when the note is not yet saved (or they should have changed that)
Hi,
You might check consulting note 3036184 - Button "Save as Draft" is missing
It's describing how to activate/deactivate this option in MTR/ MTE app via customizing of parameter SWC in feature TRVPA.
Regards,
Monika

Note 3036184 - Button "Save as Draft" is missing looks good, but it is another problem. In this example- enter reason "Test"- click directly on Button "Save and Send"- only the message "Draft saved" appears. To "Save and Send" this travel expense you must click on the Button "Save and Send" again. This may confuse users.

Hi Long,
The question is what kind of support do you need exactly.
The link you referred https://community.sap.com/support is about Community support (e.g. you cannot log on to community, found a bug on the community, etc). 
I also guess the link Dominik referred is CIC (e.g. you need a ticket speed up request, etc).
And then we also have product support https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#incident/create (i.e. you have an issue with the software).
I hope this helps.

Hello,
is there any advice / documentation around deploying Customer Checkout Manager in a High Availability "cluster" / multiple Tomcat servers? I assume if this is done one can only have one "leading" CCOm executing scheduled jobs for example, also db-upgrades might be difficult to do without a downtime.
Is there a list / tips to consider when trying to do this?
Hello  Stefan Baust ,
This is an interesting topic indeed. I haven't seen any official documentation about it, yet.
However, here are a few ideas:
 I don't *think* you can safely run two tomcat instances connected to the same tenant. That would be something that would have to be carefully taken care of by the CCO team to avoid any concurrency issues. Maybe  Bikash Bansal can give his opinion on that topic...
Hope this helps.
Best regards,
Joerg.

And also here: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CUSTOMER_CHECKOUT?locale=en-US (main product page). 
I could not find much around high availability / clustering... 
As for a DB upgrade without downtime, this can be done with HANA DB if you have a Disaster Recovery setup in place (Primary HANA DB replicating to a secondary HANA DB). You can upgrade the secondary first while your primary is up and running (replication will be interrupted to do this), then set up the replication again, replicate from Primary to Secondary (you can do this from lower db version to higher but not vice versa), then switch over to Secondary as your new upgraded Primary DB, break replication, upgrade former Primary, reset replication, switch back over to original primary. 
System downtime is very minimal (few minutes to switch over when needed) with a short period where you don't really have a secondary system available if needed. 
Edit: This blog does not talk about high availability, but rather about installing more CCMs on one machine, but it may give you some hints to what you need and the author may be able to help you with info on High Availability setups.

Dear all,
While changing the valuation category of material 23270008 from blank to 'C' ( Split Valuation allowed ) at LN03, system is raising validation error because of Stock already exists in Plant and there are PO in which material is already opened . ( refer screenshot error step 1 , step 2 and step 3 ) 
 Actually , I need to define this material for another valuation type ( NEW ) along with with NEW1 valuation type in the same system . When trying via MM01 tcode , system is not allowing by saying " Valuation category doesn't allow split valuation" . ( see screenshot actual reason ) 
I want to resolve this issue without removing the existing stock and deleting/locking PO as suggested by SAP . Is there possible to change this error message from 'Error' to 'Warning' temporarily. I have tried the configuring the Message type via OBMSG and OBA5 tcode to change from error to warning . But it is not working ? Please suggest the solution
Material created with valuation category along with valuation type- no need to change valuation category whcih is not possible but if needed you can create new material code and do not use material 23270008  by keeping  stock zero and close all related open transactions. Better to delete and archive material 23270008 
Hello Varun Kumar Dogra
First, LN03 defines number ranges for WM quants. It has nothing to do with split valuation.
Second, as per note 155874 - Change valuation category in material master valuation category cannot be changed if stock, purchase orders, production orders, sales order or WM quants exist. There is no way around that.
You have to get rid of the stocks and the documents or create a new material master.

Hi, 
we're struggling with test script for scope item 5HO. 
In 5.1.2 Staging Release Order Parts for Production, a delivery is created. But there is no entry in the app Process Posting Change Item. Is there any app where we can edit this delivery? Also the pick parts run on error, though we followed the test script step by step. (Well, as far as possible, we also created a production order in order to release it and adjusted the components etc.) The only part that is working is ad-hoc movements. 
Has anyone done this test script successfully? Are there any additional steps we need to do that are not included in the script?
 Regards, Vanessa
Hi Vanessa,
Please check if the destination storage location is the same as source storage location in Create Control Cycle app, otherwise the delivery created during staging might be an outbound delivery and not a posting change.
Have you checked if there is any stuck queue related to this delivery created? You should be able to find it in Message Dashboard app (Namespace /LEEW must be assigned to your user in Assign Recipients to User app) or in Warehouse Monitor app?
Also, which error is thrown for the pick parts? Could you share a screenshot?

Hi ,
Is it possible to delete the "Business Partner" from master data. i am deleting it , because of duplication . Can anyone explain what is the procedure to delete. IF NOT , please explain why?
Hello,

Please note that it is not possible to physically remove a master record from the system. You can only make it unusable.

As business partner is the leading master data object, there is no concept of customer or supplier master data deletion. You can mark the corresponding business partner by navigating to General  Status and selecting Archiving Flag. 

However, you can mark certain customer and supplier specific master data at facet level. For customer, the following facets provides Deletion flag:

1) General
2) Company Code
3) Sales and Distribution

This indicates that all data in the master record will be deleted for the specified facet area. Before the deletion is made, the system checks for dependent data that would prevent the deletion.

Additionally, you can block a master data record by using the flag Central Deletion Block available at Customer: General Data and Supplier: General Data.

Dear Gurus,
I hope you are doing well.As the client's request, I need to enter the vendor's material number to the Master data of the material, however, I could not find any relevant field to enter such information. PS. the client has fixed materials that are supplied by fixed vendors, so they request to enter Vendor's own number to Material Master Data as well.It would be very appreciated if you help me in this matter.Thanks in advance!
Couple of things to keep in mind:
1) You've got to know the difference between vendor and manufacturer. They can be the same, but they don't have to. 
Vendor: Volkswagen Dealer in Lincoln, NE 
Manufacturer: Volkswagen 
2) Do not put the vendor's part number on the material master. That is not the correct place for that information to be. The purchasing info record stores all the information that gets created as a combination of vendor and material master record. 
3) The manufacturer's information can exist in SAP in the  material master record or you can even create a HERS record for  it. There's a field called Manufacturer Part Number in the Purchasing tab of the material master record that you can use it's MARA-MFRPN
Also note that the Vendor Part Number (aka. "Supplier Material Number") is also available in an Outline Agreement which will be adopted onto the Purchase Order line (even if a Purchasing Info Record exists for the same material/supplier combination with a Vendor Part Number in it). In other words, the Outline Agreement takes priority over the Purchasing Information Record.

Dear Community,
This is a know limitation in the RF system, we don't have a configuration to resolve it like the one to decide only the validation to, for example source bin, batch, and quantity; that is the example you provided.
However, there is a workaround to be able to change the layout of the RF screens, that you guys can adjust the screen in the way you prefer. For Cloud customers, SAP Screen Personas might solve this issue by using a script. An example can be found in the How-To guide, please check the attachment: 'ScreenPersonas_RF_EWM_S4H_Cloud'.

Hi all,
Has anyone linked an import model with a live model by date in a story in SAP Analytics Cloud?
I have very much data that I want to analyse, so my idea is to have an import model with overview data with dates and some measures. Then in a story be able to filter on date and fetch more detailed information from a live model. It is the same BW query used, but the date fields are not possible to link. I get "Columns cannot be matched" although I tried with both ID and Description.
 I think the problem is that the format of the same date field from import and live isn't the same.
If you have solved this, or have any idea how to do, please reply.

Hi, I'm wondering if there's anyway I can perform a 3rd Party Sales Order but upon the Goods Receipt from the Purchase Order, can the stock be received directly into SAP Unrestricted Stock?
Is it always for 3rd Party SO the Vendor will directly send the stock over to the customer? or there's a possibility where the Vendor sends over the stock to the warehouse and the warehouse delivers stock to the Customer?

Hello John,

Hello John Wayne,
If item category is TAS in sale order then stock directly dispatched to customer from vendor and if item category is TAB in this case goods will be received in warehouse and then dispatched to customer.

If yes, then how to bring the edit and delete button on the object through the RAP BO (without UI breakout)?

Hi,
I using a CI/CD job to build an MTA application containing a Fiori app. When I updated the version of ui5/cli to ui5/cli@3.0.2, the build shows an error.
[2023-02-22T12:08:17.046Z] warn  mtaBuild - npm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine {

However, the job settings only allow selecting version 16.15.0 or 18.1.0, which is not sufficient for my build. How can I resolve this?

Hi dear all.
I am searching a way to influence the strucure of an inspection lot during its creation (my process is an incoming inspection starting by MIGO transaction). I want the system selects operations from inspection plan with a specific rule (example : my inspection plan can have 10 operations, but sometimes I need only 3 relevant for my context).
But before starting to specify that for my Abap team, I am searching a relevant user exit or badi. The most relevant I found is QPAP0002 with especially the exit EXIT_SAPLQPAP_002. But this one seems to import only header level structure (I see only MAPL and PLKO, and not PLPO, and even less PLMK).
Am I on the right way ? Other way more relevant ? Your point of view please ?
Thank you.
Hi Oliver,
should be possible with BadI INSPECTIONLOT_UPDATE.
Within the BadI read your structure via select....
Thank you David and Holger.
David, I am not ready to propose Ref operation set at my customer. It will make the entire solution too complex and I don't feel that relevant for my case.
Holger, yes why not. I just hope the method CREATE_AT_SAVE from your BADI can work soon enough. I will chek with an abap man.

Hi,
I am using Odata V4 which lets the user select multiple records from the list report.
Is there a way I can disable this option ( check box to radio button ) tolet the user select only one record at a time.
I checked in manifest.jason but it does not have 'Pages' option as suggested in the following post.
Multiple line item selection using CDS Annotations | SAP Community
thanks in advance.
Hello Ramesh, 
you can use the Guided Development 
Open the Guided Development by right click on the project and choose Guided Development and find "Configure multiple selection in table" and then insert the code.
Or manually in the the SAP Fiori extension (Application Modeler, see picture)
In the Application Modeler choose the the project -> Pages -> right click on ListReport_XXXXXXX (your table page) -> click Show Source Code and copy the following code 

I hope that helps

Hi,
at my latitude, some consultants is telling customers, creating considerable dismay and concern, that MII will be discontinued on 31.12.2027 and that there will be no new releases beyond 15.5, the only SAP strategy is DMC. Is this also your opinion? It's so strange.
Thank you.
Bye.
Hi Ganimede,
In my opinion if SAP discontinues the improvements in SAP MII they will go back to zero in the manufacturing area. That is, as they were before the acquisition of Lighthammer.
Factory personnel still consider the SAP MII to be a good way to get data from SAP and also send it. That's what we still see in our customers. This is due to the speed with which we develop projects with MII and also to the reduced number of people involved in the SAP MII project. Things get easier.
We have already tried to offer SAP DMC to our customers and show some SAP solutions within BTP and our impression is that the factory solutions available within BTP are not so well seen by shop floor people who have decision making power.
In addition, there is a lot of resistance in factories when we talk about the cloud. Maybe that will change one day, but costs are still high and not everything can travel through the cloud.
Instead of discontinuing they could evolve the tool, I as a developer and customer would be very happy if...
SAP removes SAP MII from SAP NW and gives flexibility to create container in Dockers and have our applications according to the architecture of each project. That way we wouldn't be stuck with a server as big as SAP NW.
In this way we could create our local/cloud projects and have visualization projects (Intelligence) or integration (API) according to the SAP customer's needs. All this on-premises or in the cloud. SAP already has a standard in SAP MII and would follow suit, but the architecture is scalable whether on-premises or in the cloud.
We could have the solutions marketed in the SAP Store as they currently exist in other solutions.
Among other improvements, I believe that every SAP MII developer could contribute to improving the tool a lot. The potential is there and so are the customers. I just think that SAP with DMC is evolving into something that is not as widely accepted because of the challenges the industry still faces. The speech is beautiful, but the reality is different.
That's my opinion. I believe in SAP MII and that it will continue for a long time at SAP.
Regards,
Danilo Santos
So, seems that DMC is the new SAP strategy for Shop Floor, in Cloud, but with options to embrace the shop floor directly without disrupting it. 
And there are a lot of papers, comments, and announcements about DMC, but Mii has a short message. Considering that Mii and DMC require a significant investment, I understand that a clear position from SAP is necessary. 
Currently, we don't have any SAP MII releases planned beyond end of 2027, however, we are exploring the possibility to extend our maintenance window to end of 2030. SAP DMC is our go forward shop floor solution. We are in the process of establishing a program that will help bridge our SAP MII customers to SAP DMC in the coming years. Our next step will be to send out more communication on our plans in the months ahead.

DMC roadmap, what we can expect from DMC: https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?PRODUCT=73555000100800001492⦥=CURRENT-LAST#Q4%202022
Hi Ganimede
That is correct but they do mention in the note "SAP MII releases is subject to changes and can be extended"
Refer this note 2894103 - Maintenance for SAP Manufacturing Integration and Intelligence Maintenance Term
Check it in Product availability matrix here

Hi Team,
We have a requirement to hide UIBB based on role in MDG BP. We already know 1 approach as below: -
1) CBA
2)/PLMU/EX_FRW_CONSUMER_APPCC: - this BADI can only use for Material not for BP.
so can you please suggest me any BADI name which can be used for HIDDING UIBB for Business Partner. (Customer/Vendor)
Hi Former Member Shah,
You can create post-exit enhancement for the method 'OVERRIDE_EVENT_OVP' in class 'CL_BS_BP_OVP_ASSIST'. There you can change the UIBB as per your requirement.

Hello SAP Community Team,
when I try to use the filter on the page:

Hi All,
I was wondering if anyone has a better guide or example on how to implement the From generic pass. 
Reading the SAP guide https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_IDENTITY_MANAGEMENT/4773a9ae1296411a9d5c24873a8d418c/62e63e49bd2a4f32a5c8a119c54a7815.html?locale=en-US
The section on the Next Data Entry, Am I suppose to return all the entries into the script? For example I want to call a RestAPI to return all the user and its details using a From Genric pass into a table in IDM. 
But Am I suppose to just call one entry? How does the script know who the next entry is?
Your "Next Data Entry" script is supposed to return one DSE entry (as returned from a call to uNewEntry, for example) per invocation. When you have no more entries to return, return null instead.
The control flow is:
You'll need to maintain state between calls to "Next Data Entry" to know which entry to return next. How exactly you do this is application/use case-specific. The SAP BusinessObjects connector, for instance, reads all BOBJ users into memory on the very first invocation, then iterates over this set using a Java iterator and returns null when the iterator doesn't have any more remaining items. You could also read page by page if your REST API supports it, of course.The pass "Read BOBJ users" from the screenshot below shows which scripts are used; you may want to look at their sources to dig deeper into the details.

In case we are moving ECC to S4HANA 2021 or S4HANA 2022 how could we know Which transaction are available in target system or not. Like transaction Ck11 Transaction not available in S4HANA but in TSTC table in S4HAN it is maintain then how could we confirm that CK11 is not supported in S4HANA.

Hi,
We have a requirement, where we have to access data from the different(ERP) system with ABAP CDS View.
How can we achieve this?
Regards,
Khushdeep Singh
If you need to access remote data from within the CDS view, you can achieve this with help of virtual elements. With the help of IF_SADL_EXIT_CALC_ELEMENT_READ, you can run any custom code within your CDS view to calculate some fields. Your custom code can also access a remote system over RFC or something. For this to work, you need to publish the CDS view as an OData service, though.
Hello Khushdeep Singh Do you have a solution for this requirement? 
Hi,
you can expose the data from the CDS view as oData and consume it in a remote abap system.

Hi,
I am trying to do the task related to multi-language functionality but it is not working.
I have an entity in MySchema.cds defined as view:
entity MyView AS 
 SELECT key t1.column1, t1.column1, t2.column2
 FROM table1 AS t1
 LEFT JOIN table2 AS t2 ON t1.column1 = t2.column1;
In MyService.cds:
 entity MyView as projection on MyView;
Table table2 has a localized column2, and table table2_texts is filled in.
If I expose just table2 it works - In MyService.cds:  
 entity MyView as projection on table2;
But it doesn't work if the view is exposed as mentioned above.
Please for some idea or suggestion how to solve this issue.

Hi SAC Experts,
Some of our data actions fail sporadically, while on other moments, they run successful (with same scope & parameters).Sometimes they fail at the final 'Publish' step, sometimes they already fail at the 'Preparing to execute' step.
2 typical error messages we see in Data Action Monitor are:The data action "DATA_ACTION_NAME" couldn't run successfully on version "VERSION_NAME" because you don't have the resources available. Try restricting the scope or try again later.
or also:
The results of the data action "DATA_ACTION_NAME" could not be published on version "VERSION_NAME" . You don't have the resources available to publish this version. Please try again later.
1. Is there any way we can see easily which resources were used that essentially blocks our data actions from running successfully? We don't immediately see other actions, reports, etc. in the performance log & statistics stories.
2. We could accept during heavy/peak moments that data actions might run slower... but wouldn't want them to fail. Are data actions not designed to check during 'Preparing to execute' state if they have enough resources, and if not, just re-try a bit later?
How can we ensure better reliability? (except for the obvious refactoring of heavy data-action steps to best of ability)

If we are scheduling backups via hana cockpit for a HANA DB, the schedule gets stored somewhere in HANA DB. Does anyone know which table or monitoring view this schedule information gets stored in. I checked m_backup* views but cannot find it anywhere. Any help is appreciated.
SAP doesn't provide much information about this, this is what I could find: Monitoring Views for the Backup Catalog
The catalog is stored on the file system, not on the DB.
Hi, 

I´m trying to Enter a Transfer Posting, using the MIGO transaction, from an IM warehouse to a WM warehouse managing Handling Units (HU).

When I try to save, the System displays an error:

"Data for creating a delivery is incomplete (Vendor)


Message no. M7279

Diagnosis

The system found that the data required to create a delivery via
Shipping is not complete.

System Response

The system cannot create a delivery.
Procedure

Check that the data for Vendor is maintained in your system:

o loading group

o debtor number

o sales organization

o distribution channel

o division

o shipping condition

o shipping point"

Does anyone know wich one could be the problem?

WHERE, ALL THE ABOVE POINTS ARE CHECKED (loading grp to shipg point) BUT UNABLE TO POST THE MIGO .

PLS ADVISE

any of these can be the problem.

Do you have a customer master? is the customer master number entered in vendor master control data view?

Has the material master sales views for the sales organisation and ditribution channnel that is assigned to the plant that you want post the MIGO to? (has to be the sales org that can be seen in T001W table)

Is the loading group entered in material master?
is the shipping condition entered in customer master?

Is the shipping point determination succesfull? the access is made with plant, loading group and shipping condition.
I had the same problem and checked all data several times, everything was fine, and I still got the error. 
Then I checked table T001W and it WAS NOT UPDATED by the system! I added the plant to the vendor master through the menu, but T001W remained empty. I had to change the table T001W and now it is working. So if you have this error check T001W first.
Dear member,
As I understand, you are trying a return process for the vendor, via delivery. You may check the delivery plant for the customer master data of the vendor.
Hi All,
When I performed foreign currency revaluation by FAGL_FCV. I can find the selected AP invoice from the log successfully. (It can select the opened item successfully)



But I can't find the document number from the postings tap.




Not sure why it will skip the line and continue the number range from next line. It is so weird.
I can find it from other documents. They are same batch. So I think it is not related to document number range and posting period.

Error message as below from system log. 




Therefore, there is no accounting impact actually. But when I try to re-run the revaluation for a single vendor only. System will show that revaluation has been done for this period. Any suggestion for the issue? Is it a system bug?
Dear Derek Wong, 
You can refer to this thread:
https://answers.sap.com/questions/9387048/foreign-valuation-document-missing.html
And to SAP note 2887522 :
https://me.sap.com/notes/0002887522
You can accept answer if helpful.
Greetings,
Regarding the issue with generating the revaluation document due to foreign currency, there are two potential solutions that you can try.
Firstly, you can navigate to System -> Services -> Batch Input -> Sessions to review the created Session for your run. By processing this session, any potential errors will be identified, and if no issues are found, the FI document will be generated without any further action required.
In the event that the first option is not successful, you can attempt to Reset the Valuation and Re-perform the process. While doing so, be sure to closely monitor any Error Messages that may appear, as this will help you to better understand why the document has not been posted. From what I can see in your screenshot, there appear to be some errors present that could be causing the problem.
 
I hope that these solutions prove helpful to you.
Best regards,
Kateryna

You could use the warranty management functionality in SAP to handle this scenario.1. Create a warranty object in the system. This object will link the material to the vendor and it will contain all the information related to the warranty coverage.2. Create a warranty claim by entering the document number, material, vendor and the details of the defect.3. SAP will then check the warranty coverage and create a notification based on the parameters set in the warranty object.4. The vendor will then be notified of the warranty claim and will provide instructions on how to repair or replace the material.5. The material will then be sent back to the vendor for repair and/or replacement.6. Once the vendor has completed the repair/replacement, they will send the material back to the sender.7. The sender will then update the system with the new material and the warranty claim will be marked as closed in the system.

Hi,
Check for the Down Payment Accounts defined or not in the BP Master Data as well.

Hi,
The settings in GL Account Determination are default for new BP created. In your case, you have to define Down Payment Clearing Account and Interim Account in Business Partner Master Data.

Hello Experts,
I am trying to add an attachment to an existing document info record(in S4hana cloud) using the API_CV_ATTACHMENT_SRV via CPI. Source system is SAP ECC from which I receive an iDoc with the url in one of the fields. When I enter that url in any browser or in Postman, I get a pdf file, but in CPI, I get the data in an attached format pdf-data-in-cpi.png. I am making post call to S4Hana and passing the pdf data in content parameter but getting attached error.png. Do I need to use base64decoder and then send the output of it to S4? Can anyone help me in understanding the issue.

Hi,
User is getting error for Lebanon tax category and Lebanon taxes I have attached the screenshot of error. The error is No calculation procedure has been assigned to country/region Lebanon. Can anyone suggest using Lebanon tax categories and taxes without config or we need to configure everything ourselves as per requirement. Thanks in advance for your reply.
Dear Pooja,Please check if the LB country solution is activated in your system.
You have to option to get the LB tax codes:1) You can activate LB country solution.
or
2) If the company code's country already activated TDT, than you can add new tax code/tax rate/tax account via related SSCUIs by yourself.
In this case you can find help in the SAP Help Portal pageTime-Dependent Taxes (TDT)https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/0fa84c9d9c634132b7c4abb9ffdd8f06/8fd78f3974b84e478dc99ae1ae1afc16.html?q=tdt

Hello,

to get a better structure in the created and already used Data Elements I would like to rename them.
Is it possible to change the name somewhere.

Many thanks

Markus
Prashant's is the safest solution. 

Here is an unsafe one. This can do the processing in Mass, through a program.

 In se37 , explore the functions RPY_dataelement*. 


Caveat Emptor- that is 'use at your own risk'.
Hi,

I think you can not Change the Name of Data element that are already created.
But if you want ot Modify that,the better you Copy that data
element and give the desire name of copied vaersion and Change whatever you want and activate it

Sujit
This message was moderated.
Hi markus,

It is possible to change the Name of Data element that are already created, but its not advisable to do so because its existing usage in multiple tables/screens/structures Renaming may give rise to a lot of problem and you will not be knowing in how many tables/screens/structures its being used and where , so the best solition is what Sujit has give i agree with him .

Hope you got the answer .

Hello, for future viewers, you're better off to: 
Right click -> copy -> change name. 
This will copy the current data element in the same package, as a non-activate data element, which is good if you want to further modify it. But AFAIK there is no renaming / refactoring in SAP for data elements or domains. 
Good afternoon!
I have a question about IDoc, which will help us in further integration with SAP and non-SAP systems.
Maybe you can help me:
Is it possible to somehow automate the process of data transfer by systems using IDoc so that we don't have to start the data exchange process manually? 
and which integration method is better for the cloud version?

Dear gurus,
I've an issue/question with loading time-dependent master data from HCM-Infotype to ZEMPLOYEE via generic datasource based directly on Infotype table.
HCM Infotype-Data
PERNR; VALID_TO; VALID_FROM; SUBTYPE; VALUE88888888; 99991231; 20140502; 9001; ABC88888888; 99991231; 20230101; 9002; 123
Requirement:

When Subtype 9001, I need VALUE (= ABC) in Attribute X in InfoObject ZEMPLOYEE
When Subtype 9002, I need VALUE (= 123) in Attribute Y in InfoObject ZEMPLOYEE

Problem/Issue
As InfoObject only has PERNR and VALID_TO as keys, VALID_FROM information is lost when loading to InfoObject. Therefore time intervals overlap (both records with VALID_TO: 99991231) and are not created/inserted correctly with DTP-setting "handling duplicate data records".
Expected result
MasterData Table of ZEMPLOYEE should look like this after load:
/BIC/ZEMPLOYEE; DATETO; DATEFROM; /BIC/ZATTRBT_X; /BIC/ZATTRBT_Y 
88888888; 01.05.2014; 01.01.1000; ; 
88888888; 31.12.2022; 02.05.2014; ABC; 
88888888; 31.12.9999; 01.01.2023; ABC; 123
Any ideas or best practise for this scenario?
Thanks!
If there are multiple records with the same characterstic key + DATETO but with different DATEFROM values, you get an error during the load. If the "handling duplicate record keys" is set, then chronologically the last record is updated.
Both situations are correct and the system works as designed.
If you need it that way, then you should split the interval in the endroutine of the Transformation with an ABAP routine and create the desired time intervals yourself. The master data loading considers the DATETO as key.

we have these requirement to avoid users making changes in the non desired period. Is there any option to fix this edti access only on certain days on month?Or any process we could run?

Hello Folks,
I am trying to use the table replicator operator in SAP DI, for initial and delta load.
Initially I tried the Initial and delta load in SAP HANA as source and target DB and it worked fine but now I have started working with actual data a source: Azure SQL DB, I ran the graph with table replicator operator and it failed with error " CREATE TABLE permission denied at the database".
I understand "CREATE TABLE permission at the source database " is one of the pre-requisites for table replicator operator, but how can I asses the changes being made by this operator at the source database. If I request this access from the DB team, would it be a right approach going forward in production as well?
Secondly, while testing with HANA DB(src and target), there are missing key and values ( max/no of batches and number of rows) in checkpoint table. Besides, shadow and shadow view are never populated with any value. Is that expected behavior or am I missing something?
Also, the primary key details of the source table are missing in check point table and the target HANA table.
Need suggestions!
Thanks,
Indu.

hi,
in the sap note we can see this:
Workaround:
The root cause is that the length of a column in the user table is shorter than the length of the defined user code. You need to fix the database to solve this problem.

A user was able to to create models and also to schedule it (refresh import model). Sometimes it went wrong and the import model reported an error. The refresh issue was fixed by updating it manually. But since last week, the user can´t click the manually refresh button (button is greyed out). 
I as the administrator have not changed anything in the roles. But the user is also no longer able to schedule models.
- User is member of Team "QM Power User"
- "QM Power User" has the role "Content Creator"
1. Question: What privileges are required to set up schedulings for import models for the role "Content Creator"?
2. Question: Why does the automatically import scheduling doesn´t work contiously? 
Hi Yigit,
Is the owner of the model still the same user? I have noticed that being able to schedule a job or refreshing manually is depending on who is the owner. Any other error message of warnings displaying when you hoover across the greyed-out button?
Kind regards,

Hello Experts!
I'm facing an issue when annotating an action with Side Effects in my odata v4 service. In accordance with the documentation (under "Side effect after executing an action" for odata v4) I've annotated my action in the following way:
// schema
entity MyEntity {
    valueChangedByAction: String;
}

// service
service MyService {
    entity MyEntity as projection on db.MyEntity actions {
        action myAction returns MyEntity;
    };
}

// Annotation
annotate MyService.myAction with @(
    Common.SideEffects: {
        TargetProperties : [
            // Unsure what to put here, tried many variations
            // valueChangedByAction
            // MyEntity.valueChangedByAction
        ]

Calling the action does not refresh the desired value. If someone could point out what I'm doing wrong it would be much appreciated!

Hi Experts,
I am trying to update t=data through SAP NW gateway using the /IWBEP/IF_MGW_APPL_SRV_RUNTIME~UPDATE_ENTITY method.
I am using REST Client in firefox browser to test the update service. 
Steps Followed .

1. used GET method to get the x-csrf-token (and that was successfull)
2. Using the obtained x-csrf-token, i am updating the data (PUT)
3. Updated the body XML with some data .

Here i m getting the return error - System expected the element '{http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom}entry'
How ever the request which i made is reaching G/W . 


Please help me on this. I am really stuck. Whether to change something in gateway side, or in the XML side.
Thanks in Advance..
Hi Now its working perfectly.
Problem was with the XML body.
Instead of the previous one, i used thew below. 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><entry xml:base="**:8000/sap/opu/odata/sap/ZMAKT_DESC_SRV/" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:m="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/metadata" xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices"><id>http://**:8000/sap/opu/odata/sap/ZMAKT_DESC_SRV/Makt(Spras='E',Matnr='1')</id><title type="text">Makt(Spras='E',Matnr='1')</title><updated>2013-10-24T03:42:55Z</updated><category term="ZMAKT_DESC_SRV.Makt" scheme="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2007/08/dataservices/scheme"/><link href="Makt(Spras='E',Matnr='1')" rel="edit" title="Makt"/><content type="application/xml"><m:properties><d:Maktg>Double dukker</d:Maktg><d:Maktx>Asset Procurement</d:Maktx><d:Spras>E</d:Spras><d:Matnr>1</d:Matnr></m:properties></content></entry>
You will get this error when the XML in the body is not right. Use the XML validator in GW Web Client to validate it. 
As Ron pointed the problem is with your request body. May be you can post it here.

How did you compose your request body xml?
In my blog on Gateway Client, I have written on how to compose the request body for Update Request as well.

Hello SAP Community, 
i have executed the CVI_PRECHK and got the error on customer as well as vendor side, that the number range of customer / vendor is not in range of the number range given with the accounting group. Over the years some vendors, for example, have changed with XK07 to another accounting group. Same as with customers. 
I have no idea how to solve this issue as it is technically not possible with XK07 or XD07 to change them back. 
How have you solved this issue while integrating customer vendors to BP?
Thanks for your help!
BR 
Sven 
Hello Sven,
I assume you are running the synchronization from Customers/vendors to BP. If that is the case and considering the changes you made, one alternative could be to assign a different number to your BPs. 
Although it is recommended to assign to the BPs the same number as the customers/vendors, the truth is that this is not always possible. Therefore, for some scenarios, it is common to assign a different number. 
Please check section 7.3.8.2. Number Ranges and Groupings from your CVI Cookbook
Thanks and regards,
Jose M.
Hello Sven,
As far as you are using TCode XK07 - Change Account Group (AG), I guess it could depend on the current state of the CVI Sync of that Customer to BP + your NR Customizing. Due to the change of the AG, it seems that system will try to create BT (if the customer hasn't been synchronized earlier) in the NR that should correspond to the Customizing of the target AG. If you are using an external BP NR with the same numbers option, it could be a bit tricky, because your Customer number will be from the legacy NR (different, from the target AG). That is why it's likely that you can run into such a problem.
Feel free to provide some more details to discuss.
Best regards,
Pavel

Hi,

We have BW 7.4 with a HANA database.

The standard DSO contained appr. 200 Mio. data records and active table had the disk size about 32 GB. This size I have seen in the transaction DB02 under "Diagnostics" -> "Tables/Views".

Then I have deleted appr. 190 Mio. data records with "selective deletion" in the manage window of DSO. But the size of the active table on the disk is not reduce. 

Is this a right behaviour? How can I reduce the disk size of the table on HANA?

Thanks for assistance

Peter
Hi Peter,

If you have large data for your selections table size should reduce.
you can see the real size by querying (SQL) view M_CS_TABLES in HANA studio. This gives you information regarding the specific table such as total memory size, delta memory size, etc. SELECT * FROM "SYS"."M_CS_TABLES" WHERE TABLE_NAME = '/BI0/A0SD_O0100';(Active table).

If you want reduce sizes split your data into physical partitioned objects (using semantic criteria/Partitioning commands) to avoid tables with more than 500 million records. Other attractive way of reducing the size of a table (and optimizing the In-Memory sizing requirements) can be using BW’s Nearline-Storage (NLS) capabilities (e.g. Sybase-IQ).

Regards,
Joseph
Hi Peter,

Can you try delta merge process on the DSO ? And also try to unload it from memory and try loading it back and see if it now reflects the correct size.

Regards
Manpreet
Hi all,

I mean the size on the disk.
Today I have copied the original DSO to the test-DSO and copied the data from the original DSO to the test-DSO. Both DSO's have now the same data, same amount of records. 
Now we can see the difference between the size on the disk.

This is the original DSO:

and this is the copied DSO:

My expectation was, that the size of the tables must be are equal. But it is not.

How I can shrink the table of original DSO that both table have the same size?

SQL statement for the defragmentation was executed:
"alter system reclaim datavolume 'volume' 120 defragment". It wasn't helpful.

Regards

Peter
Hi Peter,

I woud expect HANA automatically takes care of this within a few days after the deletion. However, I am not aware of any way to speed up this process or did you find anything?

Nico
Hi Colleagues,
Whenever an error in SAC pops up, there is an "Expand" button. When you click on "Expand", you it shows a "Correlation ID". 


What is this for? 
What is the added value of it? Why do I need it?
And, most importantly, how do I, as an end user, disable this - if I clearly don't have a use case for this.
Maybe it is something your Admin could help log/monitor/troubleshoot - see SAP Help at https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_IoT/fffd6ca18e374c2e80688dab5c31527f/a984955d878c42a1b8526848bedcf1d6.html
and I also like what Vitaliy says here: https://answers.sap.com/questions/13673313/model-information-cannot-be-found-correlation-id-4.html "the Correlation ID is unique to your instance. If you have admin privileges you can see more details for the correlation id in SAC in System -> Monitor -> Trace."
Hi Igor, on top of what Tammy mentioned, correlations IDs can prove very helpful to our SAC support engineers and SAC development engineers when troubleshooting product issues. We have tools in-house SAP that can relate correlations IDs and stack traces for our development engineers to keep a deeper & hopefully better understanding of what is likely causing the issue (if due to the product itself). As a best practice it is recommended for customers & partners to copy/paste the correlation ID as text in the support ticket in addition to screenshots. My 0,02 cents, Antoine
Hi community,
I facing an issue with CCO, i had SP12 PL 00 and my backend is SBO 9.3
My currency is $ (USD), and had to map in CCO
The problem is, the discount or quantity discount not change the price of the product, i mean, if i set volume discount for 2 items for $5 dollars, and the regular price is $6.99, in CCO calculate 2 x $6.99 + tax, instead put $10.00+tax
Howerver, the group discount works perfect, but i need volume and period discount.
Also, how can i set a promo where 2 different items (Item A and Item B) that has the same price ($6.99) when i buy together give me $10.00 both.
Thanks in advance
Hi Isaac,
Please, provide us some screenshots of your Period And Volume discount in the SAP B1 and the some screenshots of the CCO when adding the items in the Sales Screen.
About the question below, 
"Also, how can i set a promo where 2 different items (Item A and Item B) that has the same price ($6.99) when i buy together give me $10.00 both."
Currently, it is not supported in the CCO.

Hi all,
Do you know if the latest jdbc driver for hana (ngdbc.jar) supports fetchSize ? when we call setFetchSize of the preparedstatement like below, will this be regarded by the server?
stmt.setFetchSize(1000)
Regards,
Bai
The first rows (32 by default - changeable in HANA) are returned by HANA, then the setFetchSize is honoured.
Have a look at the document attached to https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2494160 on page 27.
Chris 
Hello,
Yes it is supported for our config
You can check M_SQL_CLIENT_NETWORK_IO, with bigger fetchsize you got less rows in that table.

Hi
First of all, I would like to apologize since I am a newbie on this topic. The fact is that I would be interested in knowing how I could obtain the xml (or json) output of a specific ByD Sales Quote. Currently I can go directly to a Sales Quote with the url:
https://myXXXXXX-sso.sapbydesign.com/sap/byd/nav?bo_ns=http://sap.com/xi/AP/CRM/Global&bo=CustomerQuote&node=Root&operation=Open&object_key=____{"SQnumber"}____&key_type=APC_S_BTD_ID
But it would be very useful for me to get its data directly from a url to parse some fields on an excel file. Is it possible?
Thank you
Hi Oliver Harris ,
Maybe this works for you:
1. Download Data XML via Output History of the specific quote:

2. Have a look ath the Webservice APIS: https://help.sap.com/doc/a2b4c7ef61d64397b2b1d052082a8a08/2302/en-US/IntegrationServices.html
There are 3 Webservices listed containing "quote", maybe one of them fits your needs.

We have a story built using analytics designer with metrics from 2 different models (acquired connection) and the models are linked on a common customer dimension at the story level.
Ex: Model_1 has 2 customers (cust1, cust2) and Model_2 has 3 customers (cust1, cust2, cust3). 
When we link on the customer dimension I am only getting intersecting data. The "All data" is not working. Please help!
Our SAC Version: 2023.3.1
Thank you in advance!

Hi Roopa Puranik 
I've seen this product behaviour before, and "All Data" link type is probably greyed out for a reason.

Do you have any recommendations how to solve the error? The paackages do not seem to cause any error in BAS.  Thanks in advance.  Kind regards Lukas
I would suggest that you file an incident directly for project piper: https://github.com/SAP/jenkins-library
The first thing you could check, if the BAS runs the MTA build also in strict mode at the make call (strict=true).
HI Experts 
Good Day ,
We are having some data load performance issue in Asset management flows specially for FI_AA_11 which is taking more then 5 hours as its currently full load.
we are thinking of converting FI_AA_12 and FI_AA_20 in Transaction data and 0ASSET_ATTR_TEXT and 0ASSET_AFAB_ATTR in to Delta load but wanted to understand if we are missing something as Asset Management works in different way 
We have gone through the OSS note 2962277 this looks like S4HANA note (not sure) and still in R3 system . In the OSS note we have one BAPI FIAA_BW_DELTA_UPDATE
if you have converted these flows into Delta can you please help us understand if we are missing something or share the steps taken / Issued faced for the same.

Hi experts,
Is there a possibility to add multiple account determination group for customer account with same company? 
Reagrds,

Hello,
A customer account can only be linked to one account determination group, but the ADGs can be driven by other parameters in some cases (e.g. the revenue account can be derived from the product/service instead of the customer). 
If you add more information on your use case, it will others provide guidance on how to achieve it.

Dear Colum Reilly,
You can use table NAST for the condition record creation date and time.
Please upvote the answers based on the usefulness.

Hi Radheshyam P.,
NAST gives the date and time of:

Hi All,We are trying to run opa5 test case in our pipeline using Karma runner with UI5 config but it doesn't work. Here we checked all the test case and they are running fine when we run them in parts or if they are run individually. Issue is when all the test cases are run together it gives error. When we run the tests in headless chrome browser we get Aw- Snap error.
Also when we run the test cases in git bash we get multiple errors which is never consistent. In some it looks like the issue is with the test cases but when running the test cases in chrome or individually the test cases run finely.

Possible reason could be we have many test cases(approx.120).
Any help is much appreciated.
Can anyone help me with JS rule to open a new page on selection of particular dropdown value?
I've requirement where user will select a particular value from dropdown or listpicker, and on basis of particular value a new page will open. (every dropdown should open a new page)
Working 1st time on SAP MDK. Any help would be appreciated.
Depending on how you want the flow to go, one option would be to use the OnValueChange event of the list picker to check what value is selected and then open a new page based on the selection.  This event fires when the list picker selection view is closed.  
So if you have the picker set to dismiss on selection (assuming a single selection picker) as soon as they tap on an item in the list the selection would close and it then the navigation to the new page would occur (triggered from the OnValueChange).
while iam searching PR in ME5A it doesnt displaying even though all indicators have been activated but for another user it showing.
Dear Naren, 
please check if ->
1) There are used same inputs in 
ME5A check box fields (assigned purchase requisitions, Also List Held 
PReqs etc.).
2) Different layout usage directly in ME5A (possibility of layout with default filter)
3) Default variants assigned to user (default user variant with a filter)
4) Check transaction SU53 after running ME5A to check for missing authorizations
5) Cross-check is missing PurReqs are not assigned to different plant or pur. organization

Hi everyone.

Is there any report transaction where I can get both the SO and its subsequent PO? I'm running on R/3 and I know about transactions VA05 and ME80FN. I would need something that somehow mixes both together.

Please consider that I have quite limited access to transactions, so I can't check for tables such as in transaction SE16.

Thank you
Try ALO1, this is a transaction from the archiving environment but it can be used for non-archived documents too.
check  ME2N/L/M report 
Have you looked at T-Code ME2K ?
Hi,

If you are asking about the third party POs you can also check the table VBFA .and subsequently you can also use the transaction ME2K .

Regards,
Hi,

You can also create querry by joining these tables to get the report of your own requirement.

Dear SAP Community,
I want to implement the conversion of a CPQ Quote 2.0 into an S/4HANA On-Premise Solution Quotation without BRIM. I found the following two integration packages and iFlows:
SAP CPQ - Quote 2.0 Integration with SAP S/4HANA Sales Order: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CPQ/07de686e39e148b1bda86ffc17642b88/f3540a6f978f462aafa99a515d8a7cec.html

 From my understanding the iFlow “Replicate Quote 2.0 from SAP CPQ to SAP S/4HANA Sales Order” does convert a CPQ Quote 2.0 into an S/4HANA Sales Order (not Solution Quotation)
 Link to iFlow: https://api.sap.com/integrationflow/ReplicateQuote20fromSAPCPQtoSAPS4HANASalesOrder

SAP CPQ - Quote 2.0 Integration with SAP Billing and Revenue Innovation Management:
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CPQ/a5de4dd4b8b047feb894c618aed793b9/df4810ddc9934cdab8d2bad5333e1a72.html

 The iFlow “Replicate Quote 2.0 from SAP CPQ to SAP S4HANA”) does convert a CPQ Quote 2.0 into an S/4HANA Solution Quotation but only works with BRIM and Event Mesh
 Link to iFlow: https://api.sap.com/integrationflow/Replicate_Quote_2.0_from_SAP_CPQ_to_SAP_S4HANA

How would you implement this integration? Adapt one of the above iFlows or develop an iFlow from scratch? Or is there a standard integration that I’ve missed? Do you know if there is a recommendation from SAP?
I would really appreciate the help of the community. Many thanks in advance.
Best regards
Christian

As of today, we don't have integration iflow as standard for Solution Quotation for S/4 Onprem.  Its better to ask SAP CPQ Support ticket and ask for the standard.  I know Integration package is been prepared and will come but not sure by when.  
The quantity is not show on batch number transaction report but in receipt from production with batch number assigned the problem is the quantity 6000 cannot remove. Is there a way to remove the quantity?

1. for 'local' operational reporting, use the SAC embedded reporting inside the Ariba modules 
2. for 'strategic' enterprise reporting, use SAP Data Warehouse Cloud and SAP BTP Integration Suite for connectivity and semantics on top of Ariba suite. This is the sweet spot right now for Spend Analytics

Next month our facility will be rolling out Cycle counting with the RF guns. I was wondering if there is a way to create a 2D QR code data matrix for the Quarantine pallets that are multi-tag pallets. That way when we go to Cycle count them we can scan 1 code that registers multi-pallets in the RF gun. Is this possible?
Hello experts, 
We have created an extended version (Y15 "Actual at budget rates") to be able to do an fx simulation applying the Budget exchange rates to the actual figures.

Once we have created the new version using as reference the actual (standart) version, we wanted to introduce the exchange rates linked to the new category but the exchanges rates app in fiori does not allow us to select the version.


How can we inform the budget rates on the new extended version Y15 in the AVG and CLO rate types?
Thank you in advance.
Hi Fernando,
 
in any translation method, you can assign exchange rate (ER) indicator.   The ER indicator is assigned to a ER type. This assignment is dependent on the ER special version. You can maintain this assignment via T-Code CXD2.   For example, you can set Y15 as version in global settings and enter CXD2 and then you assign ER indicator C to ER type CLO1. Then you can maintain budget rates for ER type CLO1.

Hello,
in the CPQ configuration I see currency values in brackets after the attribute value in the attribute value list. Does anyone know where to adjust this?
thank you
Hi Thomas,Prices will be in quote currency and can come from any pricing logic you have implemented (can be CPS integration as well).There are two ways of controlling their visibility:
1. Global settings on tenant level:Setup -> General -> Application Parameters -> Configurator -> Show Attribute Prices within Configurator


2. Settings per attribute are as Yogananda Muthaiah already described are done on product Setup -> Product -> Attributes tab -> Additional Attribute Defintion section-> Toggle :Show One-time Price or Recurring Price

Hope this helps!Best regards,Luka
Thomas Scholtes
The currency value is displayed for Attribute in Product Configuration is coming from (Setup - Product - Attribute tab - Additional Attribute Defination having Show One-time Price or Recurring Price
Hello Yogananda,
what I mean is what you can see here in my screenshot. No idea why this appears this way and why in the brackets these values are visible.

There is an issue with SAC trial account portal. From past 3 days i have been trying to activate my trial account to do hands-on but all in vain. It keeps throwing the "Technical Error occured" message. Did anyone experience this recently, if so how to overcome this? Any other alternative url?

Hello,
handing over a DTP Filter Value to the WHERE Clause of the select of an AMDP based Expertroutine - how does this work ?
This is the DTP Filter:

This is the Expertroutine AMDP :The Where-Clause of the Select of the AMDP expetroutine should take a parameter from the DTP Filter:

How does this work ?
Its SAP BW7.5.
ThanXs
Martin
The filter of the DTP is passed to the actual SQL statement as a PLACEHOLDER. For example if you filter on 0FISCYEAR = 2023, then the SQL statement will have a PLACEHOLDER with a filter set to this value.
Check this blog series:
https://blogs.sap.com/2016/06/17/hana-based-transformation-deep-dive/
especially the section for $$filter$$
This placeholder is used to filter the source data where possible. That means the placeholder is typically used in the next view above the union for all available source tables.
This placeholder contains the filters defined in the DTP extraction tab plus some technical filters based on the REQUEST or the DATAPAKID.
In case of using an ABAP routine or a BEx-Variable in the DTP filter, the result of both are used to create the filter condition.
The placeholder $$filter$$ is used for all BW objects except advanced DataStore-Objects (ADSO). To filter an ADSO see $$inbound_filter$$, $$change_log_filter$$ and $$nls_filter$$.
Hi,
the placeholder concept seems a weird, cryptic workarround concept and it seems, it doesent solve the problem to get the BW Parameter into the AMDP, 
also the seconde part of the problem of the transformation (to get the CALMONTh2 and the CALYEAR parameterized ) does not seem be solvable like this.
I am going for another solution.
Thank You !

Dear BO Experts,
I'm using 2 Publications (1 for DE Reports and 1 for FR Reports). 
When I schedule them, and tell them to deploy the reports in an SFTP folder, 1 of them succeeds and the other fails.
If I try to send them via mail, it works fine.
But when they should drop the reports in SFTP, it's like both arrive to the door of the SFTP and there is a fight between them. "Only 1 of us can drop stuff here"
Crazy...
Victor Torreblanca
It sounds like a permissions issue. If you're using a shared SFTP folder, make sure that both of the publications have the correct permissions to write to the folder. Additionally, check the logs to see if there are any errors that could be related to the issue. If the issue persists, you may need to contact your SFTP provider for further assistance.
Hello!
well, we have Webis and AfOs that have normal schedules that drop files in the same sftp folder.
The exact problem is when we combine:-Publication
-2 schedules
-Dynamic Recipients
-Destination SFTP (it works if destination were email)
Below export script is working.

As PoType is from TmaProductOffering, and Product in CartEntry is Product type, you need to tell hybris to get it from TmaProductOffering, or to "cast" it, I post a question before about it, you can see it from this link.
Anyway, for you question, your impex should be:
Hi Daniel,
Your header is trying to get poType from Product Type because of "product(potype(code,itemtype(code)))[alias=potype]".
It seems that potype is not there in product but it is in TmaProductOffering, hence you are getting the error. Note that product attribute in CartEntry is of type Product & not of type TmaProductOffering.
Hope this helps you in fixing the header.

Hi
We have recieved the CN and invoice and the same was posted using a dummy Gl bcoz the team thought the invoice and cn is 100% match. However. this is not the case bcoz the CN value is 185 usd higher then the invoice. And this 185 usd got clear with another invoice.
Now the issue is the dummy gl we used should always be 0 but bcoz of this case 185 usd is open in this GL. How should we clear this? Pls advise.

Hi
You could reset the clearing document using FBRA so that all items would be open again. Now you could perform clearing as you expect.

Hi,
We have implemented a workflow around Maintenance Notifications by copying the standard WS2000317 workflow template and adapting some of the tasks. 
The standard tasks (e.g. TS20000546 - Complete maintenance notification) use the old SWO1 Business Object method BUS2038->EDITASYNCHRONOUS, which launches transaction IQS2 in the WebGUI. Is there a way of specifying a Fiori app or navigation intent for the work item when using these type of Tasks? 
The work items will be launched from one of the Fiori Inbox apps, so I'm not asking if it's possible to launch a browser from SBWP; I would just like to open a UI5 app from the Fiori Inbox, rather than a WebGUI transaction. 
Many thanks,
Andrew
Dear Expert,We came across a very strange problem that after we installed ECC6.0 EHP8 system, install chinese language with SMLT, supplement with EN, everything looks ok, but in tcode SE38, there are still some fields displayed as German rather than Chinese, so far we only found this abnormal behavior in one tcode - SE38, but we did absolutely the same operations in other systems - Developemnt & Production, however only in QA system, such kind of problem appear, DEV and PRD is ok. Could you kindly help to check what's wrong with that? Many thanks.

Hi Fresh,

did you exactly follow the procedure as explained in SAP Note 2456868? 
It is not only installing the language package. There are some further steps to complete a translation.

Hello Gurus,
I added a label and input/output field to the screen in Screen Painter.
These components will be invisible to the user, but the input/output field will be filled from the outside (My Fiori app).
Hiding the label is not a problem (set the "Invisible" property to True), but there is a problem with the input/output field.
When I hide it, I cannot fill/populate it.
I have tried several options but without success:

Setting "Invisible" to True does not hide the field, but simply changes the content to an asterisk (*).
SCREEN-ACTIVE = '0' in the PBO hides the field but makes it unavailable for input.
SCREEN-INPUT = '0' the same behavior as in point #2.

I would be grateful for any useful hints/advice/feedback from your side.
Thanks
P.S. I'm not sure if that's the problem, but just in case, the label and input/output field name are the same: ZST_PAYSEND_ATTR-OUTSTD.
try the below settings.

I have an scenario named "Customer collect". In scenario, the customer takes care of the transportation logistics which means the customer "hire" a carrier and just let us know the name (SCAC Code).
I want to setup the DSO process for this scenario.
My question is if I assign the carrier in the Partner tab using the Partner Function Freight Forwarder or Forwarding agent will these partner functions be copied to the Freight order?
I'm working with S4HANA 2021 Embedded

Hi All,
We have a S4 and a BW4 system in our landscape and I wanted to check on some of the best practices of data extraction. I have the below questions:
1. With the new BW4HANA (HANA 2.0 SP 12), we have multiple source connection ODP - SAP (Extractors), ABAP CDS view, SAP SDA etc.. in S4 system I couldn't able to find the activated DataSource's in RSA6 and can't able change datasources in LBWE as well, my question is the standard master and transactional data sources Obsolete ?, if not how to extract standard data flow from s4 to Bw4Hana.
2, how extract standard master data flow through ODP - ABAP CDS connection.
With these 3 points you should be able to identify the BI Content objects and flows for your scenario.
Der Experts,
following situation:
two deployed and started artefacts:

Execuscript collection artefact being is being used in the Main Integration Flow.

I had a future Manager termination, this action created a future action (Data change) to all his subordinated people, but in the middle of this process a subordinated is also had a termination, and this is sending another record to payroll in the interfase. 
Is it possible to create a rule to restrict the termination when there is a future movement or is there an option to delete the future record?
Please see below blog on similar scenario.

Hello All,
I do hope someone can help. I feel the solution is simple but it's eluding me. Please explain things to me like I'm a 5 year old - last year my company finally upgraded to BO 4.3 SP1, having spent the previous 14 years using BO6.5 SP2, so I'm struggling a bit.
My problem is this:
There are students in a specific age band who hold English Certificates; this formula returns that number:=[Person].[Person Count] Where ([Person].[Certificate Type Description]="English" And [Person].[Age Band]="14-17")
There are students in a specific age band who hold Maths Certificates; this formula returns that number:=[Person].[Person Count] Where ([Person].[Certificate Type Description]="Maths" And [Person].[Age Band]="14-17")
There are also students who hold both English AND Maths certificates. I would now like to write 2 variables or formulae; one that returns the total number of students, and another that returns the number of students who hold both types of certificate.
EXAMPLE: the total number holding English is 27, the total number holding Maths is 3, but the total number of students is 28, so the number holding BOTH is 27+3 - 28 = 2
For the TOTAL number of students I had thought the formula would be like this:=[Person].[Person Count] Where ([Person].[Certificate Type Description] In ("English", "Maths") And [Person].[Age Band]="14-17") but that returns the error "Missing object identifier in "'English"' at position 76 (IES 10069)If I use single quotes around English and Maths instead of double, it returns the error "The date or time format 'English' at position 76 is not valid (IES 10035)"
you need to use inlist function if you want to compare more than one record.
=[Person].[Person Count] Where ([Person].[Certificate Type Description] Inlist ("English";”Maths") And [Person].[Age Band]="14-17")

Hi Team,
In my Workforce Planning Model we have setup integration with Success Factor to get the Employee & Position related Salary and then we use it for Budget.
We have setup Data Action which Admin triggers it and data is sitting inside Actual Version. Then user goes ahead and runs the data action to copy from Actual Version into either Public version or their own Private version.
On 9th Dec 2022 I triggered the Data action to bring data from Success Factor which was sitting in Actual Version. User has then gone ahead and copied into his own Private version. He worked on the Budget and made changes in FTE and added some Dummy lines. 
So now there is requirement to trigger the data action again from Success Factor to bring in the latest employee information. Now if user triggers the Data Action to copy in his Private version it would overwrite the changes he did in his Private version.
So how should I make sure their Private version data would not get impacted and only new lines gets copied. Is it possible to have Delta Copy feature in Data Action? or any other option?
Hi Ravi,
I'm not 100% sure I understand the workflow and general solution design here (which makes suggested options somewhat difficult), but to your basic question, there is currently no native method of delta only handling for data action copy step. Ideally this requirement is accounted for somehow in the design by, for example, using a data source dimensions to track end-user updates vs source system data.
Cheers,Scott 
Hi Ravi,
I'd suggest you vote here for a delta calculation feature:https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#/idea/266943
So, I made a Developer type by extending GenericItem with "name" and "uid" as attributes. Then, I created a new item with name=Nintendo EAD and uid=nintendo-ead but it's saved as "Developer[pk]" (see image below). 
Is there a way to change that? For example, Nintendo EAD[pk] instead of Developer[pk].

On our SAP S/4 HANA system, there were changes related to Finance which updated the FMBCS elements. These changes re-triggered the PO output messages for open POs and has updated as a new version in Ariba by Obsoleting the existing version. For these changed POs, suppliers need to create new Order Confirmation before proceeding with invoices. 
Is there an option or default transaction rule to turn-off Order Confirmation for re-triggered or changed POs. 
Hello Anuya,
Buyers can configure their account to retain order confirmation information on changed purchase orders with the rule Retain confirmation status of unchanged line items on change orders. 
You will want to check this Help Portal entry for more details: https://help.sap.com/docs/ARIBA_NETWORK/11ee0faf55c74bf49379485c2ca588a9/41340a47d0a3101487559b3d4853da41.html?locale=en-US 
To remove all requirements for a confirmation order, you would look to the default transaction rule: Require suppliers to fully confirm line items before fulfillment and then the transaction rule: Require suppliers to create an order confirmation before creating a ship notice in your account.
I hope that this is helpful!

Hello David Robert
As per note 2190893 - Shelf Life Expiration fields not available in MIGO
The customising for the Expiration Date Check should to be set correctly against the relevant plant and the relevant movement type: SPRO -> SAP Reference IMG -> Materials Management -> Inventory Management and Physical Inventory -> Goods Receipt -> Set Expiration Date Check (transaction OMJ5). For the movement type, the 'Check SLExpDate' (KZMHD) setting needs to be set to '1 - Enter and Check' or '2 - Enter Only'.

While creating the setting for MRP in tcode OMI8, system display above msg. Can anyone describe me that what are the parameters IDs that must be entered in SU3 for user authorization,
Thanks and Regards
Hello Shahzad,
check SU53. It should give you the required authorization object.

Hi Shahzad,
To resolve this issue, you will need to check the user's authorization roles and make sure that they include the appropriate authorization objects for maintaining parameters in T399D. You can also check the authorization objects associated with T399D by using the transaction SU24.
Once you have identified the necessary authorization objects, you can add them to the user's roles by using transaction code SU01 or SU10

Dear Experts,
Currently, in our CHINA environment, we have a complicated setup that allows YACN account codes to be output to output to public institutions by setting up and linking YACN account codes to YCOA's AlternativeAccount. 
However, One of our subsidiary in China seems to be submitting output to public institutions with YOCA account codes. 
(Q1) Do other customers in China use a YACN chart of account codes as we do?
Also, (Q2) is it necessary to submit YACN account codes to public authorities in China? Or is YOCA account acceptable as an account code to public authorities in China ?
Thank you for your quick reply in advance.KAZU
Dear all,
I had a typemiss.
Please read my question after replacing all YOCA with YCOA. 
Regards
Hi KAZU,
Good Day!
From our understanding, please refer to the following answers as reference:
(Q1) Do other customers in China use a YACN chart of account codes as we do?
A1: In S/4 HANA Cloud, YCOA is the default international accounting principle chart of account, but almost all Chinese customers will use YACN chart of account.
Also, (Q2) is it necessary to submit YACN account codes to public authorities in China? Or is YOCA account acceptable as an account code to public authorities in China ?
A2: From my understanding, it depends on the requirements of the tax bureau and the government.
I think it is necessary to submit YACN account codes to public authorities in China because YACN can traceable to local real account number to avoid audit problems.
You can double check with your onsite product expert.
Hope the answer can help you.

Dear All,
We are facing issue when we Run MRP Live from MD01n and Convert Planned Order into Process Order, system shows API (KAI, GAI) Qty 'Blank' as in Attachmentmd01n-result.png.
But when we Run MRP from MD02 and Convert Planned Order into Process Order system shows API (KAI,GAI) Qty as in Attachment md02-result-process-order.png. 
Hi,

I need ABAP code on how to get the last three characters of a string.
For example, the string is 2008000
I need to get the last 3, which in this case happens to be 000.

thank you
len = strlen ( variable ) - 3.
last_three = variable+len(3).
hi,

DATA: LV_LEN TYPE I.
DATA : LV_LAST3(3) TYPE C.
DATA : LV_STRING(10) TYPE C.
LV_STRING = '576483738'.

LV_LEN = STRLEN( LV_STRING ).

LV_LEN = LV_LEN - 3.

LV_LAST3 = LV_STRING+LV_LEN(3).
WRITE LV_LAST3.
tHANKS
mAHESH
Or clearer:
offset = strlen ( variable ) - 3.
last_three = variable+offset(3).
hi AG,

do this way ..

Any changes in material master, tax rate & Price should not reflect on older Invoice Smartform. Smartform should display data as per the Date of Creation of Invoice. 
In that case, tThe logic to smartform should always be from transaction data and not from master data.  Ask your ABAP team to consider VBAP table

Hi SAP专家，
 
业务场景如下：
我们存在最低的销售单价要求。如果销售订单的最终成交价格高于最低销售单价，则不需要审批销售订单。如果销售订单的最终成交价格低于最低销售单价，则需要审批销售订单。

 我们在系统中维护了销售价格主数据，在创建销售订单时，系统会自动显示销售价格，但是，如果手工修改销售订单的单价低于销售价格主数据时，系统不允许保存销售订单。这样无法达到上述业务场景要求。

 请问，有其他方案可参考吗？
Hi Rujia,
销售订单审批条件是可以通过 BAdI 来写逻辑的。
对于你提供的业务场景，建议尝试以下思路：
1. 将最低销售单价作为一个不可以更改的价格条件加入定价过程中，并为其分配一个小计值。
2. 为最终计算后的净单价分配一个小计值。
3. 在订单审批的 BAdI 里是可以读取到销售订单的小计值，做运算和判断，如果订单总的单价低于最低单价的小计值则分配订单审批原因。
具体内容可参考此篇 blog。

Hi SAP专家，
 
我们遇到以下的业务场景：
客户是基础化工行业。产成品P的原材料是原油。产成品P在生产过程中，会同时产出主产品中碳P01、联产品高碳CO-P02、联产品低碳CO-P03、副产品BY-F01、副产品BY-F02。由于不同批次的原油的碳含量不同，主产品、联产品、副产品的产出重量比例不固定。
 
A公司和B公司是两个独立法人实体。公司间交易的业务场景如下：
1）A公司对外采购原油；
2）A公司委托B公司加工产成品P，A公司向B公司提供原油。
3）A公司与B公司间存在委托加工合同，约定原油与产成品P（以高碳、中碳、低碳的合计重量）的产出比率、委托加工费。B公司按委托加工合同交付产成品P及副产品，公司间是以收货重量乘以不同加工单价进行加工费结算。
 
疑问：
1）ES的联产品、副产品的成本核算的核算逻辑是怎样？麻烦指教；
2）A公司与B公司的委托加工交易问题，在只有一张委托加工采购单的情况下，联产品、副产品在A公司如何收货、结算加工费？只需要在公司间的委托加工采购单录入主产品即可，还是需要同时把全部联产品、副产品录入？
Hi Ruijia,
1. ES中的联产品、副产品成本核算逻辑O基本一致. 如有具体问题，请提出，可以进一步讨论
2.可以参考以下下Scope item，就文字描述的需求给出建议不一定完善，需要实施顾问根据项目的具体情况给出解决方案。

公有云的联产品使用apportionment structure, 副产品作为负数BOM物料维护。这是本地部署的逻辑是一样的。

Hi,
We are evaluating the financial closing solution and learnt that AFC is the strategic closing tool for SAP and looks promising. However, we are still looking for the answers to following questions and probably the experts in this community can help:
1. S/4 HANA financial closing cockpit exist in core but there wont be any innovation or roadmap to this product. Is there any guideline or information about how long SAP will provide support and maintenance for it. 
2. Is it possible to extend Org. hierarchy to Profit Center and Segment? If yes, can analytic apps/dashboard show or adapt the reports and KPI according to profit center/segment.
3. AFC is fairly a new product, how is the feedback and is there any public sector use case where AFC has been implemented or deployed on BTP platform.
4. Does SAP also provide AFC trail/Demo system like others - SAC, BTP etc
Br, Abhinay
Hello Abhinay, 
I am glad to know you are evaluating the AFC and thinking it is promising. Below please find the answer to your questions:
1. S/4 HANA financial closing cockpit exist in core but there wont be any innovation or roadmap to this product. Is there any guideline or information about how long SAP will provide support and maintenance for it.
Answer: SAP has no plan to deprecate the financial closing cockpit (FCC) yet, therefore it's maintenance period is the same as the period for the product FCC is located in. 
2. Is it possible to extend Org. hierarchy to Profit Center and Segment? If yes, can analytic apps/dashboard show or adapt the reports and KPI according to profit center/segment.
Answer: AFC right now supports controlling area, company code, and plant hierarchies. We are still collecting the requirements for the additional organization types therefore your input is very valuable for our enhancement consideration. Once we can support, for sure we will also support the analytics on these types of organization units. 
3. AFC is fairly a new product, how is the feedback and is there any public sector use case where AFC has been implemented or deployed on BTP platform.
Answer: There are many AFC customer implementations since the product release. For detail on reference customers, please contact your account executive. 
4. Does SAP also provide AFC trail/Demo system like others - SAC, BTP etc
Answer: Yes, we have a demo/test license, please also check with your account executive for detail. 
I hope my answer helps and looking forward to your further feedback on AFC.

Dear Ying Shi ,
Just one additional question in context of 'Email body content' of notification scenario.

For example: Is there any way to generate mail with 'specific mail body content' for scenario ' Task released'.

Dear Experts,

The scenario is that we want to invoice 2 materials to the same customer but in 2 different currencies. Although it might sound little weird but it is our business requirement. So we created 2 Sales Orders in 2 different currencies for the same customer. But during invoicing we found that system is fetching currency in the invoice from the customer master and not from the preceding document.
I found few threads where experts are suggesting to user billing exit to copy currency from Sales Order and PO. But my question is why .. why to use billing exist for a std. behaviour. Just like billing document picks price from Sales Order or PO and not from VK11, similarly it shd pick currency also from the preceeding document. Preceding document shd have higher precedence over customer master.
Thanks.

Dear Yahya Saleem,
You can refer to tables: 
RBKP - Document Header: Invoice Receipt -> here you can find status (hold, parked, posted)
RSEG - Document Item: Incoming Invoice -> connection of invoice no. and PO
Easiest way would be to create query via SQVI.
You can accept answer if helpful.

Hello, 
I have a requirement where I receive the RSA public key in base64 format from my external sender. Now I need to do the following thing -
1. Pad the original message using OAEP with SHA-1 hash function and MGF1 mask function.
2. Derive the modulus and public exponent from the RSA key and use it to further encrypt the message prepared from step 1. I get some hint from this blog https://blogs.sap.com/2021/04/13/rsa-encryption-in-abap/
I can somewhat able to do the step #2 in ABAP. But can you please suggest how to do the step #1 in ABAP? Is there any API available to do this. We have also SAP PO and SAP Integration Suite in our landscape. I am not sure if any of these system provides the padding and encryption feature out of the box or not.

Go to menu bar then traverse for Window -> show view -> other -> ABAP->feed reader.

Hello Everyone, I'm facing a problem while trying to publish a product in the API portal. I get an error message every time I try to publish my product. When I click on "Show Details" the error message shows an empty box with no information. I don't know what is missing. I made sure API Business Hub Enterprise is active and add myself to the AuthGroup.SelfService.Admin role group. Has anyone encounter this issue is there a way to fix it 

Hello Ali,
Have you tried to register yourself as developer in the Developer Portal, in the "manage" section?

BR!

Hi Barbara Obremska 
I got the same problem today and here is how I sovled it.
(not sure why SAP did not mention this in the product creation tutorial/documentation as one of the prerequisite)

After this, I refreshed the API portal and I was able to Publish the Product.(see status in above screenshot).
Now, when I opened the API Business Hub Enterprise again, I can see that the above product is publised there, for external consumption. (see below)

I hope this works for you too.

Hi again,
to complement the conversation above, here is some more information about developer onboarding in SAP BTP API Management, Dev Portal (new name: "API Business Hub Enterprise"):
Route A: Admin assigning the roles of the Developer directly within the Sub-account.
Route B: Developer Registers itself in the Developer Portal , no ApplicationDeveloper role added by Admin
Route C: Onboard Multiple Users as an Admin 
Hope this helps!

I was getting the same error and followed what Bharat Bajaj has mentioned . Immediately resolved the issue . 
Rahul . 
The error message should be fixed. It is just not done to have an error with no description. 
Thank you Barat for the clear instruction.
Thanks so much. Subscribing to API Business Hub Enterprise worked for me. I was able to publish product.

Kindly assist in how we can achieve this if you have performed these branch transfers scenario for fixed assets with GST for any clients.

Hello Experts,
 Greetings.
 I want to create plant data and planning data separately using BAPI_MATERIAL_SAVEDATA.
 After creating plant data using BAPI_MATERIAL_SAVEDATA firstly, the corresponding plant's availcheck has been maintained proper value. however, when I create planning data without providing plant data, I get error message "The field MARC-MTVFP/BAPI_MARC-AVAILCHECK is defined as a required field; it does not contain an entry".
 But when I create planning data with plant data together, BAPI works fine.
 Does it means I have to create planning data with plant data together? BAPI would not read MARC from DB when I create planning data separately.
 Many thanks.
 
Best regards,
Felix ZHAO 
 
 
Hello felix zhao 
I'm not quite sure if I'm on the same page as you. What exactly do you mean by planning data? Do you mean MRP views 1 to 4?
If the fields of - what you refer to as - the planning data is part of table MARC, you cannot create the planning data and plants data separately. Also MRP data is plants data (MARC), thus, you also need to create the plants data.

Hi all, Facing the migration issue while connecting ODBC DSN 64 bit ,Build platform target x64,.Netframework 4.8
Setting the CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Xxxxxx all copy to local =false
Installed CR report for VS22 with sp33 and runtimes 32 bit, 64 bit.
Able to preview the report and using the 64 bit ODBC(SAP IQ) connection.
But failing to see report in the web page (Blank PDF) in the Web Application.
Hi Aj,
I don't think you can install both the VS 2019 installer and the VS 2022 installer. I never tried this because I'm using VS 2022 now, I still have VS 2019 installed and it still works, but I never tried editing a Report in VS 2019 so not sure it works.
I never asked our Developers when I was working there, I'm retired now....
I suggest uninstalling the VS 2019 EXE and the 64 bit runtime MSI, VS 2019 installer added it. And don't install the MSI's manually, the installer will do it for you if you click the OK at then end.
You will likely need to do a repair install of the VS 2022 installer after uninstalling the 32 bit version.
Once you do that then check the Interopt settings, when you build you may get the error, see my blog for more info:
https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/30/upgrading-a-visual-studio-2008-2019-.net-project-with-the-latest-cr-.net-sdk-packages/

I want to create a new catalog tile on the Ariba Guided Buying. Unfortunately, when I want to add a new tile using the catalog item option, I cannot find the item I want to add. Why this happen?
We store all our process documents in Sharepoint and link them into Signavio. But now we are changing our sharepoint name due to a divestment - which in theory means that one fine day all my links will fail together. 
We have a LOT of links. Does anyone know how I can programatically update all my links? 
Hi Susan,
Programmatically, this can be done using the SAP Signavio Process Manager API. There are different ways of doing it, depending on what data you want to ingest, either via workflow or python script.
Our SAP Signavio Services Consultants have done this for a few clients that I know of. 
If you need help with this and want to have a chat, please ask your SAP Signavio Account Executive to get you in touch with the relevant SAP Signavio Services team, and they will be more than happy to help you with this.
Hope this helps. Cheers. 
Susan Witton
Unfortunately, there is no single solution to this issue. Depending on your particular environment, you may need to develop custom scripts or programs to update the links in Signavio. Additionally, you could use a third-party tool or service to help with the migration, as some of these services specialize in such migrations. Ultimately, the best solution would depend on the specifics of your environment.

Hi Experts,

Who can advise how to resend inbound delivery LUW from ECC into EWM manually? 

Since I deleted one LUW queue of Inbound delivery which was failure status in EWM via SMQ2, then I found the inbound delivery cannot be changed or deleted in ECC. 

Thanks in advance!

Best regards,

Julia
Hi Julia 
Using VL60 you can achieve this.
In VL60 check your deli under vendor. Update any field like ASN NO or trip id.

Save .

System will re trigger the changes u will achieve the IDN in EWM.

hope to get result with this.

regards
Suraj
Hello Julia,

In my system, If I repeat output type, the inbound delivery get's re-distributed again. I would request you to repeat output type in Inbound Delivery in ECC first. you will be able to resend the inbound delivery. If it doesn't go, Try with VL60 to change the delivery information and save again. 

If it still doesn't go, Reject the IDN in EWM then recreate Inbound delivery in ECC again. 

Regards,
Sathish

Hello Everyone,
I'm using .Net NCo 3.0 library and I tried one example of tRFC wherein I see the transaction ID is created and associated with the RFC function and then invoked, after a successful transaction, the transaction ID is deleted, here we maintain the Transaction details in database for each tRFC operation, so, in this case, if the transaction fails, we can get the ID from the database and we can try again, I would like to know the code implementation of retry mechanism, there is a possibility that the SAP server is down, so when and how to restart and make sure that the transaction initiated is executed only once, no loss of data and no duplication.

The execute exactly once contract of tRFC is implemented around the ARFCRSTATE table for incoming tRFC calls. That table decomposes the tId of your tRFC into ARFCIPID, ARFCPID, ARFCTIME and ARFCTIDCNT fields. That table also tracks the state of the tRFC execution. If a transaction with the same tId is attempted to be added to the table, the duplicate is detected and the new transaction is ignored. The entry persists until confirm tId is called by the client, or the maintenance job for the table cleans up obsolete transactions, which ever comes first (I belive by default the clean-up is after 1 day / 24 hours).
When using .NCo, either your call to commit is successful, then you do not have to worry about the eventual execution of the transaction (and you can call confirm tId anytime). Or that call is not successful, and you can safely repeat it. If the server had actually already received the transaction even though the call to NCo commit failed, a repeat call to the same prior to a confirm tId will not result in a duplicate transaction as the tId will be already there in the table.

Hi all, I know very little about SAP, but my first major assignment for my job is to write a shell script that will do some SAP System discovery and infrastructure mapping. Note this question is not about scripting or programming for SAP itself. The script needs to be able to discern a universally unique id/alias for the SAP System to which the host belongs. The form of this alias is up to me -it only needs to be reproducible, unique, and permanent. To clarify, if you were to setup a SAP System on some cloud VMs, and then on a different set of VMs: perfectly perform the exact same installation and configuration: those should 2 SAP Systems should have different aliases. Here are some important considerations:
- The script is going to run on every host on some regular schedule
- All machines in the SAP System should produce the same alias every scheduled execution
- VMs are going to be ephemeral and won't live past 30 days
- A single VM could host multiple distinct instances e.g. App Server + HANA
- If a VM is used by multiple SAP Systems side-by-side, then the script should be able to produce a list of unique aliases for all SAP Systems to which the VM belongs
- We are assuming that HANA high availability is being used
- We are assuming only linux hosts for now
- The script will run on VMs in one of the major cloud providers
- The first version of the script is assuming S4HANA only but will likely change
- The script will be able to run as the SAP user and so will have execute permissions on utility functions like sapcontrol, sapgenpse, etc
- It is unknown if the script will be able to execute arbitrary database queries with a tool like hdbsql
- I cannot assume that best practices were followed with host names/SID choice/etc
- The script will have read/write access to /usr/sap/**
Ideas I've had all revolve around the script recognizing it is performing its first scheduled execution and then try to store some data to some some shared location that only others in the SAP System will be able to access. Some of these ideas are:
- I think it is possible to create a PSE using sapgenpse that is stored in the database and pushed to all machines in the system when they come online. My script could hash this PSE and use the hash as unique identifier.
- Store a random string in a system level parameter store that app servers and DB servers have access to. I don't know of any such arbitrary data store like this.
If anyone has any ideas on how to achieve this I would really appreciate them. 
Thank you for your time.

At least myself and others I've checked with can launch the reports with no issue. Most questions I see around this issue relate to an upgrade. We haven't done an upgrade in a couple years. Is this just a web browser setting that can be changed for this user?
Is user opening the report through browsing reports folder or though report direct link?
Also, try checking it with a browser other than Edge.
Hi,
Can someone help me in understanding the KF disaggregation logic. 
Demand KF disaggregation method is equal distribution.
As per 1st table i entered demand at Product level and the demand is equally distributing among other customers.
In the second table, i removed the demand and entered at Customer C only and then again entered 100 demand at Product level. Now the whole demand is floating to Customer C only instead equal distribution.

Please enlighten me in understand this logic and your inputs are highly helpful.
Regards,
Divya
Hi Divya C,
The following Key Figure configuration defines how the values disaggregates:
Disaggregation Mode:
- Equal Distribution
- Copy Values
Proportionality:
- No Proportional Disaggregation
- Same Key Figure – Stored Values (this might be maintained in your case)
- Same Key Figure – Calculated Values
- Other Key Figure – Stored Values
- Other Key Figure – Calculated Values
- Disaggregation Expression
In your case the demand KF might have the proportionality field maintained as “Same KF – Stored Values”. The values of the key figure to be disaggregated are used as proportional factors. If the transaction just started and the key figure hasn't yet been changed, the value that is stored on the database is used. If the key figure value has already been changed and a new value for its available in the planning session, then this current value is used.
For more details on Disaggregation and Proportionality: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_INTEGRATED_BUSINESS_PLANNING/feae3cea3cc549aaa9d9de7d363a83e6/0b07724f3a62480fa695722c5103c339.html?q=Same%20Key%20Figure%20-%20Stored%20Values

Hi,
It copies the batch from the subcontracting PO component tab. so either it gets copied from PO or when creating an inbounded delivery, there is subcontracting tab where you can put batch number.
Regards,
Ravi.
Dear Experts,
We are on S4 Hana and have STO process configured along with SAP EWM. Whenever we are creating delivery against Sales Order, the person creating the delivery has the option to select the batch or over write the batch selected by the system from the option available on the screen. However this functionality is not available in VL10F where the batch is automatically determined by batch search strategy.
Our Requirement is that whenever fresh production is generated, we need to move this stock to our warehouse on other locations through VL10F and subsequent transportation. Thus user requires a provision to update the delivery document created against the STO. Since we are using EWM and delivery get distributed to EWM, User doesn't have the option to update the document using VL02N. 
Any suggestions on how to go about it As the user prefer that the batch selection should be in their control and they should do the batch search themselves manually.
Note: we do not intend to by-pass or completely terminate the batch search strategy currently being deployed on the remainder of the processes. 
Regards
Hi, Can you use LIFO - Last In First Out batch search strategy for STO Delivery (that's standard SAP)? STO Delivery creation is a background and once it's generated, it will distribute to EWM. It seems like you want S/4 users/buyers to overwrite that batch number. Another option is you have to put enhancement/BADI where you can change the delivery header status - VLSTK to "D" and then when they make changes, it will distribute to EWM.

Ravi
Hi,
I am trying to run a Workflow on SAP intelligent robotic process automation desktop design studio. But I am getting the error saying scenario could not be started. I tried to activate the entitlement in my SAP HANA trial BTP cockpit but the subscription failed. My workflow can not run on standalone mode. Do I need to activate the Foundry or BTP for my workflow to execute in trial mode?
iRPA is now part of process automation. Meaning if you activate this today, you have to subscribe to sap build process automation. Not sure if it is available on trial account but it is for the free tier accounts.
Hi Onkar Mehakarkar,
As Wouter has already mentioned iRPA is now a part of process automation along with Workflow Management. It has already been announced that iRPA will be sunsetted in this blog. SAP Process Automation is available in BTP trial accounts, for instructions on adding to your BTP Cockpit see here. It's recommended also to migrate your desktop studio projects over to cloud studio following this guide. For further information on the general transitioning of SAP iRPA to Process Automation, view this Help portal page.
Side Note: SAP Process Automation has now been renamed SAP Build Process Automation because it's being packaged with other products like SAP Build Apps (originally AppGyver) and SAP Build Workzone, hence the name change in some documentations.

Note: The external service is made out of calc view with parameters
Kindly help. David Kunz Gregor Wolf 
Thanks

Hi David Kunz 
Thanks for the reply!!Well, I wrote 'key' hypothetically to avoid using exact names as my service.
Passing with and without quotes around the value also, didnt work.Finally, I found the cqn way of passing which is finally making the correct URL '/ABC(Key=‘123’)/Set'.
Would be happy to try any other way of achieving the same :)
 SELECT: { from: { ref: [{ id: "Abc", where: [{ ref: ["key"] }, "=", { val: `${value}` }] }, "Set"] }, columns: [ { ref: ["*"] } ], where: [{ ref: ["fieldname"] }, "=", { val: `${value}` }], } };
Hi  Kanika Malhotra ,
"Key" is a reserved keyword, so it must be escaped and you don't need quotes around the value.
Best regards,David

Dear All,
I am using analytic application for customizing report in terms of making a dropdown list with dimensions from query (live connection), however would like to see only 4 specified dimensions instead of all available in model.
I tried to modyfi code with getMembers instead of getDimensions, however still unsuccessful.
Thank you in advance for sharing any hints!
The code I use:
var dimension_list = Chart_1.getDataSource().getDimensions();
for ( var i=0; i < dimension_list.length; i++){
 Dropdown_1.addItem ( dimension_list[i].id, dimension_list[i].description );
}
Dropdown_1.setSelectedKey('[Model_Name].[parentId].&[Month]');
Hi there,
There are a few options you could use to achieve this. (i'm assuming the requirement is for the same dimensions to be used in the dropdown each time the dashboard is viewed - so these options are hardcoding specific dimensions)
Option 1: Manually Entering them in the dropdown widget  (best for performance as well)Using the sample model ' Best Run Juice'
If you select the dropdown widget you can manually enter the dimension ID and Text (Description in the dropdown)

You can grab the Dimension ID's and Descriptions using this code:console.log(Table_1.getDataSource().getDimensions());// I added it to a button so at runtime I can click it and show them all in the chrome console

Option 2 is via a script
As an example I added this script to a button, It grabs all the dimensions from the datasource, compares them to a manual list (dimensions =["Product" etcOnly those dimensions whose description is present in the manually created array will be added to the dropdown
Thank you James, works perfectly! Performance for 1 option is indeed better than 2 one. Thank you!

We have embarked on migrating from CI9 to CIG based integration for our Ariba Buyer portal. However, while performing regression testing, we are encountering the below error messages:
The following errors were received from the external system: E : No instance of object type PurchaseRequisition has been created. External reference: # 1  
E : Unit of measure PCE not defined (please check your input)
I have checked the Unit of measure (PCE) by exporting the UOM values & found that the value PCE exists in the export file:

It was also confirmed that the UOM PCE is mapped to itself in the UOM mapping CSV file:

Further, the UOM PCE also appears for selection in the drop-down list while creating a PR.
 Can you please advise why this error is getting generated.
Kindly advise.
Thanks,
Sameer
Hello Sameer Kadam ,
I assume, that this error is being raised from the integrated in the ECC or S/4HANA system, also visible in SRT_MONI.
Please check two things:
Without having the chance to look into the system, it's tricky to help. Above points should at least guide you in the correct direction.

Hello Experts,
I am looking for supportive information.
I am using in my project variant configuration setup. In the pricing condition for PO instead of having a constant gross price, I have the price from the variant. Thus PO gross price is visible on the PO as 0.00 and with a "red" bullet. Is there any info for the standard SAP setup that explains why is like that? I couldn't find any solution to skip this the gross price read from my PO as it's mandatory. From my perspective and the process that I have, for now, don't see any issues later on in the process related to that. I can post and pay invoices and so on. I am only looking for confirmation if this is the current system behavior or if I should change smth. 

Hi, 
I'm on BI4.2 SP6 and I'm looking for a way to put a tooltip on a bubble chart (as it does on a bar chart).
Is there a way to do this? 


Thanks
Can you please recheck if you can see the mouse over value.Mouse over functionally is working in 4.2 SP08..

in your opinion in which order should we migrate data to QAS client to get a good connection between the master recipe and the production version so they are auto identify to each other after migrating BOM and Resource 
1-Master Recipe then Production version or 
2-Production version then master recipe 
or it doesn't matter the problem is that after migration Production version and then master recipe everything looks good but the system needs you to go to every material and manually click just check button to see the task list is exist and give you the green color 
Hi Islam,
In my opinion, migrate the Production Version before the Master Recipe. This is because
when you create a Master Recipe, it references a specific Production Version. If the Production Version is not yet in the system, the Master Recipe cannot be created correctly. However, if the Production Version is already in the system, the Master Recipe can reference it and the required BOM and routing data can be automatically populated.

Hi,
Here is the scenario,
I want to have previous six months values in my current forecast months. For example, if I'm in Sept22 then I would need the values of Mar22 and if I'm in Oct 22 then I would need Apr22 values. Please refer below screenshot.

I know this can be achieved via data action but is there a way to achieve this calculation via calculated / restricted measures at story level? Anyone who has faced similar kind of issue or knows the workaround for this case. Their comments would be deeply appreciated. Thanks
Al Zaib Mohd
Not sure of your model type, Measure based or Account but you can try something like below. As you have not mentioned what should be the value if a month less than September is selected, I assume it should be 0.
Created 2 calculated Account members. Examples are based on Quantity measure. You can do the same with calculated Measure if the model is measure based.
Forecast: [d/CALMONTH] is my date dimension.
Forecast Qty: Just to check for month between Sep to Dec and use the previous measure
Output: 

If you wish for a reporting layout like you have shown, just create a calculated account with formula like below using above measures.
Output like your table shown:

Hope this helps !!

Hi, 
in e.g. cost center Plan/Actual App it is possible to select a cost center, but it is NOT possible to select a Cost center group. 
This is the most important selection-field for my users in existing ECC-System. We are now have a brown-field project from ECC to S4. 
In the old Report writer/painter reports we have the Cost Center Group as selection field, see screenshot:

In the Fiori app for cost center Plan/Actual i only can select the Cost center, but NO cost center groups, see screenshot.

Any idea for that ? Why is SAP so "stupid" and does not offer this important field in selection ? 
br Martin
First, you can check the app documentation in the SAP Fiori Library to see if it lists the required authorization objects for the app. To do this, go to the SAP Fiori Library (https://fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/index.html) and search for your app.
If the documentation does not list the authorization objects, you can try using the transaction code SU24 in your SAP system to see the authorization objects that are checked for the app. You can enter the transaction code in the SAP Easy Access Menu or in the command field of the SAP GUI.
Once you have opened the SU24 transaction, enter the name of the Fiori app in the Object field and click the Display button. This will show you a list of authorization objects that are checked by the app. You can click on each authorization object to see the details and check if it is relevant for your use case.
Please note that the authorization objects required for a Fiori app may vary depending on your specific implementation and configuration. It's important to work with your SAP administrator or security team to ensure that the required authorization objects are assigned to the appropriate users and roles.. 
Cost Center group reporting is avialable look below screenshot.: 

I would like to recommend this Fiori app to you. I took this screen shot from Version 2021.
Cost Centers - Plan/Actual 
F0949
By using su24 you can trace authorization object for related fiori app. 
Hi Experts,
In my MDK app, I have few old requests that had faced error when uploading last time. I am using sample Mobile service api ESPM service. 

I created a few new records through the app which are new 'CreateEntity' actions and then trying to sync. But the new records are not getting uploaded, only the old failed requests are being retried to the OData server.
I took a mobile network trace from MS cockpit and the trace contains only old requests but nit he new ones. Is it an expected behavior?
Best regards,
Sumit
Generally speaking transactions are sent to the backend in the order created on the client.  So if there is a failure that would stop subsequent transactions from being sent.  You should fix or clear the error and then sync to continue processing.
We have the need to delete a team member via batch process. If a TM is a no show, we want to delete all records tied to this TM. Possible via batch? There a transaction or function module?

Hi experts,
I'm unable to see "My Employee File" from the dropdown menu after switching to my inactive assignment via the employment switcher.
There are only two selections made available after expanding the menu, namely 1. Home, and 2. Performance
Is there any way employee can access their inactive employment profile?
Hello,
The Employment Switcher is available in the profile of the user with multiple employments, but this feature is not yet fully functional. There is an ongoing enhancement being tracked in ECT-114530. This touches features of two modules (EC and Platform), hence, engineering is carefully planning the fix. This KBA will be updated accordingly as soon as ticket ECT-114530 provides timeline of the fix.
The PM and Calibration form is created against a User ID. In your case you probably have a PM form in Home profile.

Hello, I have a lot of promotion, we have been creating promotions rules (and, consequently, drools rules) for 2 years without a stop. So, the system is overloaded. I am thinking about creating a Impex, to eliminate a lot of promotions that make no sense anymore. So the header I was thinking is: REMOVE PromotionSourceRule; code[unique=true] -> to eliminate Promotion Rules
and the header to eliminate the DroolsRules is not ready, because the code is not unique. I am thinking about using the PK. 
Has anyone tried this before? 
I tried it but it didn't work very well from memory. 
I ended writing a groovy script that archives all rules that have expired. I suppose you could modify this to delete after archiving. This will run on a cron every night.
there are out of the box cron jobs in the latest versions to remove the drools rules. its called droolsrulemaintainence job. also there are lot of recommendations given to take care of the promotions under Cx works area of sap.com. please do validate.
Hey Gurus,

Looking for the best practice in this situation. 

We are brining a new company onboard with SAP. They have one main office with two additional branches for storage and that crews work out of. 

Should we set the braches up as different plants within the new company or just treat the branches like different storage locations. From my reseach there is an arguement for both.

Thanks!
Ih two additional branches for storage and that crews work out of. 


New COmpany means what ? is it Company code.?

If yes and want valuation at new branches.

Answer : Yes yo should go for creation of Plant and storage location which has wider business prospective for future growth of org. / business.
Hi!

If you use different plants, you have the advantage that you can use stock transport orders to get material from one branch to another. 
You can run a normal MRP and need not to work with MRP in storage locations.
You may have also problems with the valuation of the materials when only using storage locations, because the planned delivery costs are normally different between one vendor and the different branches.

have fun.
Flo
Dear, 

Depends on what operations branches are going to perform. What costs branches consider for materials inventories, will be the same. Sales operations etc. 

But as you mentioned in simple - Storage location will be enough - but varies based on exact business process. 

Regards, 

Syed Hussain.

would recomend; one plant for the new company, different warehouses (both with there own storage locations) for each branch.

So plant XXXX
warehouse AXX storage location 1xxx
warehouse BXX storage location 2xxx

like you said there is an arguement for both but this way is best in my own personal opinion
Hi dear,
It totally depends on the business process that will be followed at two locations.If it is very clear that two locations would be used for storages then no harm to define them as storage locations under one plant.
If there are chaces of other business transactions also to take place from there then it is better to define them as a separate plant.
Hi
We are brining a new company onboard with SAP. They have one main office with two additional branches for storage and that crews work out of. 

 one main office -It will be plant

 two additional branches for storage  ,Is it manufacturing unit,They have any registration for excise or production,How far it from each other and from your production plant
If no manufaturing ,then create depo  or warehouse in sap 
If they are very near to production plant then create storage location

Hi, 
I have an issue, we have choose the availability check Z1 and works well in our sales order but in the delivery have a different scope, can we have different scope for sales order and for delivery in the same availability check? or can we have an availability check for sales order and a different av. check for delivery?
thank you for your time
Dear Cecilia Romero, 
There can be indeed different availability check logic for SO and delivery.
You can refer to transaction OMCP where you have to define checking rule for each availability check (group):

There you can see that SO (A) and delivery (B) are customized completely separately.
You can accept answer if helpful.
We have multiple materials that share the same GTINs due to our brand's requirements to maintain the same barcodes irrespective of the supplier. We would like to integrate EDI into SAP but how can we overcome this issue with the ZH32 table which matches the GTIN with the material if we need to add multiple materials with shared GTINs? Would the addition of matching our customer's product codes to our own materials in VD59 help? Could EDI operate on this one-to-one basis instead of the GTIN being the determining factor?
Hello Laura Hardy,
What could I understand you have Z-table in which you are maintaining materials with shared GTIN and also you are maintaining customer material with your material in VD51. If yes, it's suggested that please check the feasibility to enhance the transaction VD51/VD52 for GTIN field or you can maintain GTIN in any existing text field of VD51 to process your EDI instead of using Z-table. 
Also if some materials not maintained in VD51 and you want to process EDI for those materials then you can explore the field in material master in which you can maintain GTIN for processing. In material master there are some fields which are not usable, you can use those fields.
Think on it, it's suggestion.

Hi,
I have a requirement where we will get multiple cost centers from source and we need to map with new cost centers. We will get Old cost centers and New Cost centers from BTP Tables and created Hashmap Property through using Groovy Script Ex: CA1000012 = CA1000013,CA1000014 = CA1000026. How to Retrieve HashMap values in Message Mapping? Any one have Groovy Script that can be utilized in custom function inside message mapping?
You can absolutely do that. Instantiate a HashMap object from the property object and properly type cast it. There should be lot of examples on Groovy forums for this.
Dear,
If you have assigned the hasmap properly to any property then getProperty method will anyhow return object. So use below to get the value from HashMap.
Hi, our customer is using PMGM and has recently started a new performance cycle, so people have completed their 2022 Goal plans. However, not all goals on the 2022 goal plan are "completed", either because they have been "cancelled" or not met due to other reasons and wont be transfered to the 2023 goal plan. 
The customer wants to keep this information intact, as it is an accurate representation of the goal states in this point in time. 
Now, all those goals that have not yet been completed, show up in the Goal card on the Latest homepage. Dismissing the goals will only cause them to reappear withing 7 days. "Mark complete" is also not an option, since some of those goals won't be completed for the reasons above and this would lead to missleading information and it's cluttering the goal card with no longer relevant goals. 
SAP has provided the following conditions for the goal to disappear: Mark it complete, Delete the goal, or it will disappear after being more than 365 days overdue. None of these options sound good. 
Have there been any ways to work around this and provide a solution? Maybe with permissions to the goal plan? 
Thanks!

Hi experts
Is it possible to upgrade SAP_BASIS from 700 to 740 without an full EHP8 upgrade?
We have an old ECC 6 (NW700) system that requires certain components from 740. The obvious way is to do a full upgrade but that is time and energy intensive regarding regression testing.
Any documentation on how to do this?

Hi Joe,
You have to upgrade all the ECC components not an single component of Basis alone. It is inter linked with other components like ABAP, PI basis, BW, etc.

We added a new question to our job application template. When the candidate applies, they see the new question and can answer it, however when the hiring manager or recruiter open that applicants profile, the new question and answer are not visible. What am I missing? 
Found it ... I had to edit the Field Permissions within the application template to enable the Recruiter and Hiring Manager to see that new question. 
I have a weird issue. Code change has been done to an existing RFC enabled function module(Custom) and migrated to QA. 
When executed from SE37 or via Program, the correct version(recent) is being called. However while calling from Third party, still old version is being executed. This was confirmed by having an external breakpoint. 
I can see the code in the debugger but cursor behaving similar to the older version. 
I had seen this issue within clients but get resolved after sometime. But not in QA. It is more than 2 days but still issue persist. Created a new transport and migrated. But issue still persists. 
Any suggestions? 
I am not RFC expert, but could it be that Third party has still opened one old RFC session / connection?
Check this ABAP help document:
https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abenrfc_context.htm
By calling FM RFC_CONNECTION_CLOSE you might be able to close old session and Third party will (hopefuly) call latest RFC module version?
Hi,
It can be that the metadata cache of the third-party application is not refreshed, which could cause such issues. See SAP Note 1479970 Changes in RFC modules are not reflected in Java Server.

Hi, I'm building an integration with SAP Service Cloud. My server application is going to use OData API to access SAP resources. I would like to use OAuth 2.0 to authenticate my clients with SAP in order to get an access token to communicate with API on their behalf. Access token should also be refreshed regularly without client intervention. 
I'm new to SAP ecosystem and struggling to figure out how to configure OAuth 2.0 for the scenario above. I only have SAP Service Cloud account. While reading help article https://help.sap.com/viewer/ea72206b834e4ace9cd834feed6c0e09/Cloud/en-US/ba893b5161d34760989429c24b28f25b.html I've got an impression that I should also have an SAP Cloud Platform account where I will register my server application to be able to authenticate and communicate with API on client's behalf. 
Could you please confirm my assumption? Is it possible to implement OAuth 2.0 flow with SAP Service Cloud account only? 
Thank you!
It seems that OData API doesn't support classic OAuth 2.0 flow: https://github.com/SAP/C4CODATAAPIDEVGUIDE#authentication
As an alternative I'm going to use 'OAuth SAML bearer flow'. For that I need to request a token from C4C platform.
Hello,
Based on my experience, C4C prefers Basic as well as Client Certificate-based authentication and for these, you do not need any explicit configuration for trust establishment.
In case you want to authenticate your client with an OAuth 2.0 flow for C4C OData communication then you need to have an OAuth Identity provider who can authenticate the incoming user. By standard SAP provides OAuth mechanism via SCP hence following article talks about the same:
https://help.sap.com/viewer/ea72206b834e4ace9cd834feed6c0e09/Cloud/en-US/929294823bc44614ba2034662f043793.html --> For Neo

However they are not just restrcited to this but you can use any other OAuth Identity Provider as well like Okta or MS ADFS but the procedure for et will remain the same i.e. register a OAuth server for authentication and register OAuth Client for OData Access,

And how to fix the errors in TEXT format, which was showing Fiscal year missing. This fiscal year filed mentioned in the format and i have filled as well, apart from this where I needd to mentioned or what was missing?
Hi, 
Is this a quick way to find whether S/4 is pre-requisite for listed feature?

Hello,
Crystal 11 had no concept of Windows 11, lots of change made by Microsoft which caused this to happen.
I suggest upgrading to Crystal Reports 2020 to be supported on Windows 11, you can upgrade from the Start screen of go here:
https://www.sapstore.com/solutions/99043/SAP-Crystal-Reports
Also note, you MUST upgrade your reports to Version 2020 also, simply open them, Refresh the Report, click on File, Print and select the printer and Click on Apply, don't print, now save the report, Cr will now use the saved printer info in the report when printing.
Don't use No Printer, but if you do you also MUST check on Dissociate option.

Hi to everybody,
I've encountered a problem with Crystal 2022 patch 4 (14.3.2. 4272 but also the previous patch): it's no more available the function to divide (cut) a section. In CR 2020 (and all previous version), it was possible to split a section directly by pointing the cursor (left click) in the left side ruler dragging up and down the cursor to the point of the cut.
This "bug" is very annoying because there is no any other possibility to cut/divide and resize a section.
Please, any idea?
Thank you in advance.

Hi Dausto,
I asked our Developer to have a look at this and he confirmed it is a bug.
Someone in the Support Team will create a KBA and escalate the issue to R&D for a fix in a future patch for CR.
Have a great day

I'm creating a report on VB.net 2022, MySQL and proper Crystal report version. The report wizard working well. the problem arise when I run the form that contained the crystal report viewer, it shows the error below:
An error occurred creating the form. See Exception.InnerException for details. The error is: The type initializer for 'CrystalDecisions.CrystalReports.Engine.ReportDocument' threw an exception.
is it a bug on crystal report or what? please help me to solve this issue. thank you.
OK so i have developed a VB.net web application that uses the crystal reports for visual studio module and wanted to know the license issues with deployment to the customer. I used Visual Studio 2022 community edition and downloaded the CR for visual studio and the reports are displayed on a webpage. also I developed a windows EXE that can open a RPT not view and send it to a printer. can you help please?I have called 0808 1012181 a number of times only to be told they can't answer despite trying 5 people
I have done a number of webchats and no one can answerI have emailed and noone repliesplease help and advise me as i have been trying for 2 months to deploy my software with no idea on license/costs
Hi Paul,
Unless you get an OEM support contract they won't pay much attention to you, go here to get to the real people, mayby, ask for OEM sales.
https://support.sap.com/en/index.html
Click the Chat window.
To become and OEM partner you need to sell a lot though.
For Cr for VS go to my WIKI page:
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/Crystal+Reports%2C+Developer+for+Visual+Studio+Downloads
On that page is a link to the Licensing Info.
Crystal Reports for Visual Studio Licensing (updated)
Quick answer is for every user who logs into your app you/they need to purchase Crystal Reports Designer per deployment, this is where an OEM Partner is a better deal, you get discounts etc.
You can purchase bulk licenses also, though OEM Sales partner.
To get CR Designer 2016 or 64 bit 2020 go here:
https://www.sapstore.com/solutions/99043/SAP-Crystal-Reports
Good luck
Don
Hi Paul,
I've been informed there is no OEM contracts available for CR for VS any more so you'll have to follow the the Licensing info and single purchase a copy of Crystal Reports per deployment.
Have a great day

Hello Experts, 
Is there any BAPI available for MP30 forecast execute function? If i understood correctly with BAPI BAPI_MATERIAL_SAVEREPLICA one can update the forecast value. But is there any BAPI/FM that will the trigger the same function 'Execute' as in MP30 
Hello
I don't think we have a BAPI to run the forecast, but you can create your own FM to submit program RMPROG00.
Regards,Caetano
Dear P D,
I think you do not need BAPI for executing total forecast calculation.
You can refer to standard transaction -> MPBT
You can refer to this thread where is MPBT shortly described:

Hello Experts!
1) I run balance carry forward task thru consolidation monitor and I see:
FS-ITEM 101010 - SUBITEM 900 - PERIOD 2023.000 - USD 1000 (which is perfect).
2) Then, I did flexible upload of an external consolidation unit for 2023.001. as follows:
Parameter PERIODICAL BLANK (FOR YTD DATA IN FILE)
FS-ITEM 101010 - SUBITEM 915 - PERIOD 2023.001 - USD 1765 <--- YTD value
I want the balance for 2023.001 to be equal to USD 1765.00, so I expect that GR loads just the difference of USD 765.
3) When I run Group Data Analysis Report my surprise:
GR did not consider the beginning balance of USD 1000 already loaded as part to calculate the final balance; instead it loaded the entire USD 1765, summarizing a final balance of USD 2765.
I do understand that this happens because I have two subitems here: 900 (beginning balance) and 915 (variant).
But my question is:
Shouldn't GR have considered EVERYTHING (independent of the subItem) to calculate the correct movement value to be loaded into the subItem 915?
Am I missing something?
PS: This is not happening to S4H consolidation units! It happens only for external units loaded thru csv file.
Thanks a lot for the help
Jadir Mendes
Hi Jadir,your understanding is correct and there is following roadmap item which will allow identification of dimensions and dimension values as a total - https://roadmaps.sap.com/board?BC=6EAE8B27FCC11ED892E919ED096400CC⦥=FIRST-LAST#;INNO=000D3AAC9DD21EECBCF2EF70A3597520Please be aware that in case of No Posting/Entry settings of Subitem there is an exception when there is no data existing for the consolidation unit in any preceding periods of the fiscal year and then opening balances can be changed.Kind regards,Tomas
I think that's why it doesn't work:
For example, subitem 900 (Opening balance) is set to No Posting/Entry. For consolidation units that have opening balances carried forward from the previous fiscal year, if you upload a file that has the input type Cumulative and update mode Delete all, the exact existing values in the system need to be included in the file on subitem 900.
So, I understand that, for EXTERNAL COMPANIES, as long as I will execute balance carry forward task, I need to upload files with PERIODIC data.
Am I right?
Hi Jadir, 
Do you specify any movements at all in your source file or is 915 more or less a place holder for all movements?
The system expacts that you deliver the ytd movement, but that still does not include the opening balance. (and for Januari the YTD movement will always be equal to the periodical movement).
I would double check wheather it is possible to exclude the openingbalance in the export from the source system. 
Hello all,
Thanks for the replies.
Customer decided to continue with BCF for all companies and they will upload PERIODIC data for the external ones.
Thanks again!

Does anyone have a step-by-step guide (or can guide me) to configure Phase Control Codes in the 9 phase Reactive Maintenance orders? Thanks Gurus
Hi Maria,
I would read these two pages first to understand the concept:
Phase Control Codes
FAQs - Phase Control Codes
In the FAQ link above, there is an example of blocking a phase (Ready to Schedule) based on a permit-to-work process (no permit has been issued yet).
If this is insufficient, reply back with what you are trying to actually achieve. eg: What phase you are trying to block based on what context.

We are trying to build a workflow based on the Person Responsible of the PM Work Center. How do we assign a Person Responsible in S4H Public cloud as there is no integration with HRMS and we cannot assign Personnel Numbers to the Work Center. 
Hi Maria,
What type of workflow are you trying to create?
It all ties into the 'teams/responsibility management' concept now.
1. You use the app 'Manage Teams and Responsibilities' to create a team for each Work Center (I just did 1:1 relationship)
2. In the team you can link the PM work center
3. In the team you can add business partners.
You can define different 'functions' such as a team lead / team owner which could be sufficient for a person responsible.
This structure can then be used for processes such as the Maintenance Order approval workflow, or filtering on technicians in the work centers for dispatching in the scheduling apps.
I would review this link for more info on how to setup if this is what you are looking for: Setting up a Work Center Team

I am unable to proceed , can anyone please point me the right direction as the information even from console does not tell what exactly the problem is.

How do I sort Attributes into alphabetical order ?
Hi,
some list are of type "unsorted" and can not be sorted, even in the GUI.
I now the pain very well and I am asking this for ages but it will most likely not come.
BR
Volker
Hi,
go to Model - Attributes. There you can sort attributes alphabetically by Name, by Code or by any other string based property. You can sort it even by entities owning the attributes. You can filter the list too.
If you don`t want to alter default list of Attributes or you simply need more types of view (different sorting, different filtering,...), you can create multiple List reports. Go to Reports - List report wizard. Here you can sort, filter, add or remove individual properties. You can have multiple List reports with different settings. And these List reports are live, so when you add some attributes they automatically become part of all your list reports (depending on your filtering, of course). And you can even create snapshots for certain points in time and access them anytime later.

I had tried ticking the asset shutdown field, but it didn't works. I change the depreciation key , e.g. 0000-zero depreciation, it works, however i do not know what is the implication of doing this.

What is the best option to stop depreciation of an asset?

Thanks.

Best Regards,

Roberto Sayo
Hi,

One option is to change the depreciation key in Asset Master to MANU - Manual Depreciation. Depreciation is managed manually. Or setting to 0000 should also be ok.

Rgds.
Hi, 
just activating the shut down indicator will not do, you have to change the depreciation key also to allow shut down, this is the last field on depreciation key screen,hope this helps
Hi,

No depreciation for a period of time 
If you have an asset which would not be used for production purposes for next six months as the plant is being closed. 
Therefore you don't want to retire the asset and neither do you want depreciation to be carried out during these six months period. 
Once the plant is opened, from then on, you want to execute the depreciation run. 
You can utilize the Asset Shutdown feature on the Time-dependent tab of the asset master record. 
Select the Asset Shutdown checkbox - create a time interval - Save. 
If you cannot find the checkbox, it could be hidden :- 
In AS02 click Environment -> Screen Layout -> Master data 
Select the Screen Layout and click Logical Field groups 
Select 3 - Time-dependent and click Field group rules 
Tick Opt, Mnno and Sbno - Save 

Optionally, 

you can set the Depreciation key in the Deprecation Area Tab. 
You can also change the depreciation key to '0000' (No depreciation and no interest) for each of your depreciation books. Just make sure you have run depreciation up through the current month before doing so. When you are ready to put the asset back into service, reset the keys to their original values. The system will calculate no depreciation during the months where you have the key set to '0000'.
Hi, I think that using 0000 depreciation key will works correctly
Regards
Hi,

Good evening and greetings,

Please go through the following SAP OSS Note

Note 454989 - Shutdown not considered with depreciation calculation

Please reward points if found useful

Thanking you,

With kindest regards

C_S4HDEV1909: SAP Certified Development Associate - Programming in SAP S/4HANA, for SAP NetWeaver ABAP Programmer.
The certification C_S4HDEV1909 says that it is an "Associate level" certification which means that, it is for fresher.
1. Please correct me if I am wrong and
2. can a fresher directly go for certification C_S4HDEV1909 without learning ABAP ?
Thank You.
Hello KIRAN KUMAR
As per the description of C_S4HDEV1909 SAP Certified Development Associate - Programming in SAP S/4HANA, for SAP NetWeaver ABAP Programmer
The "SAP Certified Development Associate - Programming in SAP S/4HANA, for SAP NetWeaver ABAP Programmers" certification exam verifies that the candidate has the knowledge required in the area of Programming in SAP S/4HANA. This certificate builds on SAP NetWeaver ABAP programming skills and experience that is then refined by practical experience during several projects. This exam validates that the candidate possesses foundational knowledge in the area of SAP S/4HANA ABAP Development
So if a fresher, without ABAP knowledge passes this exam, that would defy the whole certification purpose.

Is the access via the User menu (GRC) -> Message Monitor -> Monitor Outbound NF-es/Events -> NF-e Monitor what you are looking for or do you really need a t-code?

Hello Experts,

I have the following scenario for one of my clients. So far, one IM storage location (0110) EWM managed. One storage type 5000 (multiple storage bins) representing the warehouse, and another storage type 0050 (fixed bin with sometimes several fixed bins per material) representing the shopfloor where there are some racks…. Generally, items are mainly stored in fixed bins in the shopfloor, and in case of overflow the same item can be stored in the warehouse as well. In the warehouse can be stored low turnover items as well. My customer would like to automatically trigger the components staging from the warehouse (storage type 5000) to the work center and backflush the quantity in the PSA, and automatically backflush in fixed bin for components stored in storage type 0050 (supermarket). I might use PMR functionality. Any idea to cover that business requirement? For me we have to stage components to the PSA in both cases. 
Thanks for your feedback

Hi all,
I saw in this KBA: https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3072236 that when submitting a data capture form, “Authentication process also checks for fields already completed by existing candidate. Candidate can only view fields not already completed”. Does this mean that if existing candidates apply to the form part of the data they fill in (if already present in their profile) is not saved in their profile? Isn’t the information placed in the form by candidates used to update their profile, even if data is already present?
I opened a ticket to the support two years ago and they said that they knew about this issue but they had no ETA for the fix. Do you know if things changed in the meanwhile?
Many thanks in advance,

Dear all, 
Being in S4/Hana Public Cloud, we need to make it possible for a German private Company to send e-invoices (O2C) to different customers (public or non public...) with XRechnung.
My understanding is that we have to activate PEPPOL in SAP S4Hana Public Cloud and that it requires the following prerequisites before we can start specific configurations and mappings*... Is this check list correct ?

First : we understood that scope item 5XU must be activated (1J2 is not enough).

Then , check list of actions to be processed :
A. prerequisites : 
0- I understand that we need to subscribe to Peppol Exchange Service for the Cloud Edition of SAP Document and Reporting Compliance by getting in touch with your SAP representative for further details (then we'll receive different emails...)
1- Create additionnal users : https://help.sap.com/docs/DC_PEPPOL/18b7404616704ee5a71ca373418fc4bf/b09412d672f8423fa04590602ea92cd7.html?locale=en-US
2- connect the service to the back end system : https://help.sap.com/docs/DC_PEPPOL/18b7404616704ee5a71ca373418fc4bf/8b906172650c4872a849a4b30577d983.html?locale=en-US
3- Enable your company to send and receive electronic documents : You register your company in the Peppol network (is it point 0 ?) and are ready to send and/or receive electronic documents from your business partners. See Enabling Your Company to Send Electronic Documents in the Peppol Network and Enabling Your Company to Receive Electronic Documents in the Peppol Network.
4- Configuring Custom Identity Provider (IDP) and Using Own User Base : https://help.sap.com/docs/DC_PEPPOL/18b7404616704ee5a71ca373418fc4bf/f6142c71c1874270aabab446981acf5c.html?locale=en-US
Then proceed to Integration : it looks a little bit like the previous prerequisite points but my understanding is that the following points are different andd also need to be done. Am I correct ?
B. Intergration : 

Creating Communication UsersYou create communication users required for establishing communication between SAP S/4HANA Cloud and Peppol Exchange. To be able to exchange data, the two systems must authenticate themselves.
Creating Communication SystemsYou create communication systems required for establishing communication between SAP S/4HANA Cloud and Peppol Exchange for the Document Compliance Peppol Integration (SAP_COM_0529) integration scenario.
Creating Communication ArrangementsYou create communication systems required for establishing communication between this system and Peppol Exchange.
Configure Connections to Service for SAP S/4HANA CloudYou use the Connection Management app, to define the configurations required for S/4HANA Cloud to connect to the service.
Connect Service to SAP S/4HANA CloudYou use the Connection Management app to define the configurations required for your service to connect to SAP S/4HANA Cloud system.
Download Service CertificateYou download a certificate from the Connection Management app. This certificate is required for the creation of a communication user in SAP S/4HANA Cloud

C.- Then, for memory, the finalization would be done in the following steps / Germany : 
- Configuration Options for Key Users – referring to doc types mapping to edoc, ID types for business partner, etc. 
- Configuring Value Mapping for fields in XML 
- Master data – maintain the party ID’s in company code, customers, suppliers 
details : https://help.sap.com/docs/DC_PEPPOL/18b7404616704ee5a71ca373418fc4bf/e21093a94e934531949cc48029b9ec1e.html?locale=en-US
global view : https://help.sap.com/docs/DC_PEPPOL/18b7404616704ee5a71ca373418fc4bf/9925b6f3fefd421c9cc0fca47ce5ba43.html?locale=en-US
D. And then, as we want to use XRechnung, we should also : https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/e2d057b7b4df44ba941a040d4dda2956/d7b504827698421189ca346341dc1f8e.html?locale=en-US&q=xrechnung

 For each business partner you want to send electronic documents by e-mail, you've chosen the E-Mail Process with XML option in Assigning Party ID Types to Business Partners (Mandatory).
 You've integrated Peppol Exchange and done the onboarding activities. Check Integrating with SAP S/4HANA Cloud. (done in previsous steps...)
 For each business partner you want to send invoices by e-mail (XML), you've maintained their e-mail addresses in master data. Check Maintaining E-Mail Addresses of Customers.
 If you use the process described in this topic along with another process, then you've registered factory classes to generate additional electronic document instances. Check Activating Additional eDocument Instance Creation (Recommended).

Thanks for your understanding, there are so much documentation that I need to realize a check list !
Kind regards,
Guillaume

But I think I'have alreaduy read all this and made a check list from it and from other documents again. But there are so many documents, and sometimes the fomulation is different so it is not obvious to say if the subject is indeed or if it is only the formulation that is different... Anyway this is the reason why I had this check list done and wished you could confirm confirm.

Hi,
Please advise if there is way to hide button in the EBRR app (Revenue Recognition (Event-Based)
Buttons to hide with the app:
Enter Temporary Adjustment

SAP专家老师：
下午好，SAP专家老师们，我公司有S价自产半成品，下阶物料全是V价外购材料，由于业务需要，公司在2023年不在生产该S价自产半成品，且下阶V价物料的采购信息记录价格已到期，所以在发布2023年1月份标准价的时候，将S价自产半成品做了剔除，但是发布时，系统还是错误提示：下阶V价物料没有价格。
想咨询下各位老师，为什么将相关的成品所涉及的这个物料都有做了T除，全部T除干净后，这个S价物料还是报错了？是因为不允许T除半成品吗？这个T除有什么限制吗？

Hi LIZHEN,
剔除是指在所有存在的BOM里面把该半成品删掉了是吗？
估计是有没删除干净的状况，或者该物料在选择阶段仍然被选中了。

Hello Experts,
I want to restrict a role to only view on certain Cost Centers.What I did:
Maintain Business Roles ->

Maintain Restrictions->

Set the CostCenters in "Acess Categories" Read, Value Help & Value Help and apply "Leading Restriction"
But somehow the user is able to see ALL Cost Centers, when he uses for example the App "Supplier Invoice List"

Why does the role still allow to see all Cost Centers?
Only this restricted Role is applied to the user. 
Thank you!
Manuel
Hi Manuel,
In app IAM Information System app id F2450  for 
"Business Role ID" include all roles assigned to the user
"Access category" equal to Read 
"Restriction field" contains Cost Center 
check whether there are not restricted items.
Especially for 'Cost Center Hierarchy'

We are implementing public cloud in our project. my module is SAP FICO. is it correct that all the configuration is done by SAP. Do we need to upload the master data and transaction data. will the GL accounts differ from the GL accounts given by SAP. if we need to change any configuration we manage your solution is it correct. how the transport of changed data is sent to Production. can anyone explain in brief.

Dear Experts,
My customer has service orders that will not expire prior to their fiscal year end.
Apart from running the 'Event-Based Revenue Recognition' process (which will do the necessary accruals/deferral adjustment postings), are there any other mandatory tasks/considerations required at the fiscal year close for the service orders to seamlessly transition into the new fiscal year with the ability to continue service order administration and present the service order financials?
Please confirm.

Hello All,
S4 HANA Cloud.
We are closing a Profit Center so currently we plan to block this Profit Center. However we have IC subledger as well as multiple offset entries already booked in this PC. We now want to transfer the balances to a new PC. Please help with below queries-
1.How can we transfer the old PC present at subledger line item. What process suits best in this case? Since its a recon account no direct transfer can be made.
2. There are few documents from older periods. Is there a way to avoid forex involvement for this scenario?
3. Is there any App which can help to post in all the currencies since old periods cannot be opened?
Thanks
Hi Vishal,
The allocation context for Profit Center is restricted to G/L account types N Non-operating expenses/income and X Balance sheet accounts (also documented in SAP Help - Allocation Contexts). But reconciliation accounts cannot be posted directly.
For the reposting you could create a new G/L account with type X (or N depending on original G/L account) and use this account as Overhead Allocation Account in the Universal Allocation. For the allocation type you use Overhead Allocation instead of a Distribution. As sender you can use reconciliation accounts in Universal Allocation, but for the posting you cannot use it.
This should result in a credit (debit) posting with the new G/L account on the old profit center and debit (credit) on the new profit center. For reporting you would have to assign the new G/L account into the same FSV node as the original (reconciliation) account.
This workaround should also be useful, if you want to repost primary/secondary costs elements on profit centers. See also KBA 3117138 - Allocating Amounts Between Profit Centers in Universal Allocation.

Hello,
We are using Embedded TM in S/4 HANA 2020.Somehow I am not able to find a proper method for mass maintenance of TM Transportation Lanes.
All information I've been able to find so far, whether by looking for IDocs or BApis in the system or via notes search and blogs, is about EWM Transportation Lanes it seems.
Indeed I found quite some references about BAPI_TRLSRVAPS_SAVEMULTI2 and IDoc TRLAPS_SAVEMULTIPLE202 for instance but the nodes structures of the bapi, in terms of carrier assignment to Transportation Lane, only point to BAPI11201TRMCARR2 which expect to provide carrier as location ID (and not as carrier BP).Hence this looks to me more like the data you provide when using transaction code /SAPAPO/SCC_TL5 (SCM EWM module) (where you can assign TSP location ID) rather then the one expected when using transaction code /SCMTMS/TL5 (TM module) (where you can assign actual carrier BP nr and herewith can benefit from automatic carrier selection when planning freight orders in TM). These two transaction codes seem to create the same transportation lane header and means of transport nodes but different nodes in term of carrier assignment. And the ones created via /SAPAPO/SCC_TL5 (SCM EWM) do not seem to be useable in TM carrier selection...
Anyone ever managed to create Transportation Lanes (and thus assign Means of Transport AND carriers) in TM.It seems odd to me, seeing the nr of instances to maintain that no other methods would be available other than the one provided in the transaction /SCMTMS/TL5 itself (tabs "Mass Maintenance") which only provides some collective maintenance feature and mostly copy options...
Thanks in advance
TSP assignment transaction /SAPAPO/SCC_TL5 (not useable in TM) (location ID)

Carrier assignment transaction /SCMTMS/TL5 (useable in TM) (carrier business partner)

Hi,
Scenario Builder - > You can use this TM application to download the templates for all kinds of master data (transportation lanes, zones). If you have the lane data (along with carrier) in a excel format, I believe Scenario builder would be most suitable for mass creation/update.
You could give this alternative a try to see if this suits your scenario.

Dear Experts,
I am working with inspection type 1701, I have posted the GRN through EWM and after GRN an Inspection Lot is being created but that is coming always in CRTD status instead of REL Status even though the inspection plan already exists in the system. See the below screenshots for reference.




The above one is being released without any error if I released it manually through QA02.

I want this lot should get released automatically once the lot is triggered after GRN posting.
Please help me to resolve the above issue.
Thanks in advance,
Mateen.
Hi
check around the sample calculation.
The drawing sampling procedure is probably asking for the number of containers to be able calculating the size of sample. And as far i know, depending to the S/4 Hana release, you have to apply an OSS note to get them from the EWM inbound delivery.
Hi Mateen
In this case, set the box "inspection 100%" in the inspection type 1701.
Seems not to be the case according to your screenshot
Are you using the physical samples?
I can see you are using the usage 9 (material check) for the inspection plan.
By default the inspection type 1701 is linked to usage 5 , check the customizing for the inspection type 1701 if its well linked to usage 9.
With QA02, are you manually select the usage 9 or coming from automatically?
Hi Mateen
Are you using embedeed EWM? Check QRSETUP configuration for the warehouse E001 and your inspection rule 4
May be some inconsistencies with inspection type 1701
We set up the flexible workflow for blocked invoices and the approver derivation and processing an approval works fine. However, if the workflow is rejected, it ends and in the Fiori-app no settings are possible to process anything further.
My expectation would be that when rejected the creator of the invoice receives a notification (ideally in the MyInbox-app, but alternatively also via email).
As an alternative, I tried to add an email notification (YY1_00800251_COMPLETE_NEGATIVE) but this doesn't get triggered either as it seems (other email notifications CRT_ALL work).
System is S/4 1909.
Hope anyone can assist. Thanks in advance.
Hi Achim,
Checking the documentation, it doesn't seem like completion E-Mails are supported in 1909 for this scenario (see here). I'm afraid you'll have to wait for 2020.
Best regards,
Mira
Thank you Mira, a release change is planned for later this year, but we cannot wait until then with the workflow change (due to legal reasons).
So part one of my statement becomes relevant, as I'm surprised that the flexible workflow (standard) in that regard does not provide a notification to the creator of the invoice in case of rejection. Is there a way to achieve this without having to utilize a customer specific workflow?
Hello All,
My webi report should showcase the data based on user response when user gives 2020 as year selection in prompt and in the cross tab or vertical table my years should go till 6 years such as 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 by fetching the revenue amount. Data is there in table till 2028 but based on prompt it should change dynamically. I did checked multiple blogs and implemented the same formula but data is showing differently and in turn amount is showing blank. As per the screen shot if you see when I give 2020 its bringing 2018 and 2019 which should not.

Hello Folks,
We make a permission filter to restrict display of planner data but we need to display same data (capacity that is shared between 2 planners). Is there a way to make restriction as mentionned previously.
Regards, 


 SAfouen Galai
Yes, you can create permission filters for planner data to restrict the display of certain data. To display the same data (capacity) that is shared between two planners, you can create a permission filter that includes criteria to ensure that the data is only visible to the appropriate users. Additionally, you can also assign user roles to ensure that only the necessary users have access to the data.
Hi
I was looking at the slides for cloud and for on-prem migration:
SAP S/4HANA Migration Cockpit - Migrate Your Data to SAP 
cloud: https://www.sap.com/documents/2020/07/7a263781-a67d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html
on-prem: https://www.sap.com/documents/2017/07/26113ac0-c47c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html 
I also saw similar questions but not really answers to it. How to perform multiple load cycles in public cloud?
On the slide of on-prem there is following sentence: "Several test data migrations are required before you transfer data to the SAP S/4HANA production system."
I think this is also required in cloud. Especially since processes usually need to be changed / adapted much more to the cloud system than to on-prem, it also means data need to be changed much more.
As the migration cockpit only allows creation of data but no change and having only two systems with single "client" it means that if data is loaded wrong first time there is no option to load it correctly as a test before productive load. Or is there a chance to load again into another "clean client"? Simulation is helpful but only when looking at a single object. If an error in Material Master load is only found during stock load, how to correct these errors and test the correction when the data is already loaded and there is no other test "client" available?
If in cloud environment only one load of data is enough before loading to production why does SAP think that is not true for on-prem?
Thanks!
Best regards

you already solve this issue with removing Id's.that's good😊

destroy that xml fragment like this,

Hi Former Member,

First access that element where you want to destroy it.

var id = sap.ui.getCore().byId("IDinFragment");
id.destroy();

Dhananjay
The Dialog component has an event called afterClose. You should use it to destroy your Dialog when you close it.
Example:



Another option, if you don't want to destroy the Dialog (whatever the reason you have), is to check if the Dialog has been instantiated, avoiding to create it again.

Example:

use the id for columns but keep the cells without IDs 
Hi guys,

I'm experiencing problems within VL10b.

I created a cross-company purchase order with all the necessary data. If I open VL10b and select the order (by date or order number... both works) it is shown just fine. BUT when I click the button for background creation, it doesn't work.

There's no log or error-message, just nothing which would give me a hint about what's the problem.

Anybody got any ideas what to check in order to find out where's the problem?

Any input is greatly appreciated... thx & regards,

Make sure the PO is released and or the shipping data is populated

if the plant is not setup for shipping data than also you will not see the delivery
Hi,
Open your order & check 'Delivery Schedule' tab.
Check 'Delivery Date'. Check it to system date & then try to make delivery.
It should be displayed in VL10B - background check.

Chintan

You can just use maintenance views in SM30/SM31.

Hi Atharva,
please make sure to not include the spaceDefinition property in case you only want to update the definitions. If you include the spaceDefinition property, the user is required to have update privilege on spaces. If you don't include it, DW Modeler privileges are sufficient.

Creating a table in SAP Data Warehouse Cloud (DWC) using Command Line Interface (CLI) is a straightforward process. The following steps should be followed to create a table in DWC:
Login to your DWC account using the command line interface (CLI).
Run the "create table" command followed by the table name, column name, data type, and column length. For example, to create a table named "Employee" with columns "Name" and "Age", the command would be: 
The table is then created in DWC.
Insert data into the table using the "INSERT" command. This command is used to add values to the columns. For example, to insert a record into the previously created table, the command would be: 
By following these steps, you can easily create a table in DWC using CLI.

Hi expert,
 Our company uses Business ByDesign. In our Purchase Order Approval Process, we only set up local currency amount thresholds for different approval steps(levels). But in our business, many of our suppliers use foreign currencies. Recently, I found in our approval records with foreign currencies, ByDesign seems to ignore the currency, which may skip the approval processes that the POs should have. I don't know if my understanding is correct.
 In our configuration of Currency Conversion Profile, there is one for creating PO, which uses the exchange rate in posting date. Does that mean the system converts the foreign currency to local currency in approval processes to judge if the PO amount exceeds the approval thresholds? If yes, when is the date for the exchange? Here we choose "Posting Date", is that correct? Should it be "Document Date"?
 Thank you if you can explain the logics of catching exchange rates when we only set up local currency approval thresholds.

Best regards

Hi I have purchase requestions generated through MRP in which a plant is getting picked as fixed vendor I want to remove it..
How can it be done??
Thanks in advance
Dear Nikhil, 
Please check material master, MRP 2 view and value in field -> special procurement key
Also you can check source list setting -> transaction me01
You can accept answer if helpful. 
Not sure if it is a configuration issue with the RSP in SAP but it seems that I can't see the database on the dashboard.




Hello,
We had the same issue. We solved it by going to the path in RSP -> Configuration -> Channels ->Directory Channels, which was enabled with max directory size 500MB. Unfortunately, you cannot change the directory folder size to more than 500. So what we did was, we deleted the older files in the result folder (to free up some space) and restarted the "SAP Business One RSP Agent service". On the next log on in RSP we were able to see all our databases. 
I hope it works for you too.
Hi,
I have done Integration of SAP Service Cloud with Qualtrics for a process, were in once the ticket gets completed a email with "Qualtrics Survey URL is sent to the customer. Customer open the Qualtrics Survey to fill the Survey response. On submission of the Customer response, the Survey Details gets replicated back to tickets in SAP service Cloud. Our client has a requirement where in they want to have a report in SAP Service Cloud to have these details captured related to the Qualtrics Survey. We want to know if there's any standard report or Datasource for capturing Qualtrics data. We can see there's one report "Survey Score" earlier but that has been deprecated now this report does not captures the Survey Score and Percentage. 
I have checked "Ticket Survey Answers" datasource but It does not fetch the correct data.

Hello,
I've set related configurations to work with "Inventory-managed MPN" for interchangeable parts.
I have two problems: 
1- in production order the ATP popup is totally empty! as if ATP check doesn't recognize interchangeable part.
2- in Sales Order the ATP is executed automatically, and split the item therefore the sub-item is a substitute part and it is OK BUT I need the scenario that system open a dialog so that user could select between more than one part. 
Additional data: in the MIGO with reference to reservation the process work fine: the system open a dialog and I can select between suggestions.
my data is very simple. A, B and C are parts and they're all in one FFF-class fully interchangeable. also note that I'm using the standard/default setting for availability checking group "02".
SAP version is S4HANA.
- is specific configuration or something else missed?
- is it possible to have material exchange in CO11N automatically during backflush? (and also COGI)
Hello
In the customizing activity Define Settings for Material Exchange and Restricted Interchangeability, make sure that you selected Manual or Automatic material exchange for code CO09RIC, then try to run ATP manually for your production order component. 
I'm not an expert about sales order ATP, but I suppose that the same setting for the respective SD code should resolve the problem.

I have two Goods receipts with same batch. Suppose first GR qty is accepted with inspection lot, then second GR quantity also can add in same batch and same storage location without creating a new inspection lot.

Suppose first GR is rejected then for second GR new inspection lot will be created with same batch with same storage location.

Suppose first GR inspection lot is pending then second GR quantity also can add to first inspection lot.

Rgds,
Krishna
Hello 

You can do this by

1) Go to QM view in Material master
2) Inspection setup
3) Inspection type Details
4) Inspection control -  2 An inspection lot for each material ,batch & Storage location

If you set this indicator, the system creates only one inspection lot for each material and batch. This setting is only advisable for materials with a batch management requirement.

You can setup this in the default values of inspection type

Please revert back with your feedback

Regards

gajesh
Hi Krishna,

The solution provided to you by Gajesh is absolutely bingo for you. Will work perfectly. And as per best of my information, it will work, even if the material is not batch managed also.

So just do the settings as suggested by Gajesh, in the inspection type for material master. And check.

Regards,
Shyamal
I have applied the solution, but it does not work with the Handling Unit.
Do you have a solution,

Hi
have you implemented Time tracking/time sheet modules for Germany using duration as reporting method ?
If not, why ? is the reporting method Clock time legal requirement for Germany employees ?
Hello,
In our system, when we create an outbound delivery, a stock reservation is made (Schd. for delivery). So if there is not enough stock users cannot create the delivery.
our need is to allow users to create a delivery even if there is no stock, with an incomplete status like the case of purchase orders when we do 'put the document on hold', nothing can be done (post goods issue...) but we can save the document.
We don't want to remove the stock reservation and control permanently, but we just want to be able to save the delivery and come back to process it when the stock is filled.Thanks.
Go to 0vlp, select your delivery item category where you can see a field "Check quantity 0".  Set this to warning so that system will allow you to create delivery and save.

Hello. 
I am trying to write a groovy script to exclude employees from my CPI integration. I need to exclude employees who have been terminated for 90+ days. 
So I would a script to remove employees when EmpJob/employmentNav/endDate is 90+ days from current date. 
Suggestions? 
Hi Heather,
Something like the following would work, but I did alter your payload slightly because it was not valid XML.  2 EmpJob entities were embedded in another EmpJob entity and they repeated but there wasn't a single root.  I ran this XSLT against your two lowest EmpJob nodes in a node named root.  Note the short circuiting and operator in the date check because your example has a date node with no value, which doesn't work with date functions.  Essentially, it is checking the 90 days in the past rule if there is a value and outputting nothing in that case, otherwise it outputs the node and all child nodes and attributes.
Regards,
Ryan Crosby
Attached is an example of my payload file after Success Factors call. 
payloadaftersfcall.txt
Yes, I would want the entire entry for the employee to be deleted from the file if the termination date is 90+ days in the past. 
Attached is a payload file with both a terminated employee (an example of what should be removed) and an active employee who should remain in the report. payloadaftersfcall.txt
In your payload, I see that you are using EmpJob Base entity. (this brings up all the measures of the employee's organizational change) . It's best to base EmpEmployment and navigate to the EmpJob entity. This will give you better management of the employee's hiring records. Well, you can better handle rehiring scenarios that can play bad for you. From my own experience and by recommendation of the ODATA SSFF manual it is advisable to consult first EmpEmployment.
Also try calculating in a script the date of 90 days in the past. and you can use in the extraction filter as a condition
Hi all,
is there a way to use the usage api within an Fiori Application created in BAS or is there an existing guide, which shows how to use it?
I would read via a $.ajax get against the monthlySubaccountsCost api endpoint, shown here: https://api.sap.com/api/APIUasReportingService/resource
Further information to this, can be found here: https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/monitoring-usage-information-using-apis-of-sap-usage-data-management-service
Is it possible to test against this service from the BAS or do I have to deploy the application each time to CF?
BR
In the details of the documentation you find Service Plans. You need to create an instance. Then you can create a destination that can be consumed in BAS using a service key that you've created.

Hello,
I am working on setting up the S4HC tenant for the first time. After the initial tenant activation is completed, I need to complete configuration activities for organizational setups in CBC. 

When I click on the "Assign Purchasing Organization to company code" activity, it opens the S4HC tenant but gave me the following error message

I checked my user role assignment in the admin console, and make sure I have all user roles assigned.

Does anyone run into the issue before? How to solve this?

Dear SAP Expert,
In Release Billing Proposal app, we could not generate DMR with error message showing "Document is incomplete". Noticed the Sales Price per Unit column has no value, could this be the reason it is causing the error?
Btw, I have checked the condition records (PCP0 condition type) are maintained with the valid period and values. 
Appreciate your expertise on this.

Hi experts,
I have been looking for a solution for my problem, I already went through multiple questions & answers with the same problem but nothing seems to work for me.I am doing the SAP Learning Journey - Developing with SAP Integration Suite with my trial account and I am completely stuck on the topic where I need to publish a Product.

My user has all Roles Collections necessary as I have been following other questions & answers and yes, I am trying to access API Business Hub Enterprise before clicking on Publish but I always have the same screen, doesn't matter what I do (clear browse history, use incognito chrome mode or even delete and assign all Roles Collections again)

If I click on Login button it does the contrary, it logout.
Please, any clues here on what I have to do so it really works?
Hello Flavio,
I have the same problem in my trial account. I also tried to delete the capability and also deleting the whole SAP Integration Suite and reconfiguring everything. This did not work. I wrote a mail to SAP to help me on that but since 4 days no answer. You should open up an ticket or write a mail to SAP. They should be able to reset the configuration so that you can try it again.
The problem seems to be, that I opened the API Business HUB Enterprise before configure the APIM. Normaly with the role APIManagement.SelfService.Administartor you should see the "APIs" Link under Settings:

This example picture is from another tennant there the configuration was done correct. In my case I do not see this link on my trial account although I have the role collection. 
Only after configure the APIM over this link the API Business HUB Enterprise will work correct.

The relationships is deleted in the BP the source system, how it can be replicated to the target in mass? ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
Manual replication will not trigger a deletion of the last relationship. If you want to achieve this switch your system settings from Pooled Output to Direct Output (or Object-Dependent Default) and it will work automatically. If "Object-Dependant Default" is set a deletion of the relationship will automatically trigger a deletion message for the relationship. There is no other way to send the deletion of the relationship message. Another option would be to use the changes option in DRFOUT.

Good morning,
I'm working with created universe on a HANA view.
I noticed that if I make a change in the field label on the Hana view or a change from dimension to measure of a field by refreshing the structure in Information Design Tool I cannot intercept these changes.
If instead I add a new field, it can identify the modification of the CV.
Do you have any suggestions?Thank you
In this case you need to change the objects description and dimension to measure manually.There is no automated way.Refresh structure is applicable at Data foundation layer.
Hi,

anyone knows commands for this to update.

Thank You,

Hi Priyanka,
I ran 'npm install -g node' in the terminal view. That solved the node.js version error. I now have a new issue. 
Kind regards, Marius
Hi,
you need to update NodeJS Version on Your Business Application Studio.
For this you can do on your terminal : 
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.36.0/install.sh | bash
==>After that you need to close the terminal and to open new one : 
npm config delete prefix
nvm install node <version> ( you can use nvm install node to get the latest one )
node -v : to check the installed version

Hi Experts,
We have recently exported and Imported one of our environment in PaPM Cloud from one tenant to another.
Post import we are unable to see the Reports which are defined in the process management. We have also deployed the process but the report section is completely blank.
Please see the attached print screen for your reference.
exported-tenant.png
imported-tenant.png
Regards,
Vishal
Hi Vishal,
Thank you for raising this topic in the Community! ��
To begin, if you have a newly imported environment, it is expected for the reports to be empty, even if a process instance has been created (deployed). 
Given this behavior, it is recommended to create a new Report with report elements. 

Once these has been created and you return to the environment screen, the new report will now be displayed.

Hope this clarifies your concern.
Best Regards,
Venus Cruzat
Hi Vishal,
If the environment you imported already has a report, this is the expected behavior. The report will not appear in the Environment under Reports initially after being imported. If you have a created report (imported environment), when you create a new process instance (open/deployed), the reports will now be visible in the Environment screen under reports after saving it.
Hope this answer your question.
Thank you,
Venus
Hi All,
I tried to extract the Body data from the XML payload, but couldn't succeed so I blogged and couldn’t found the one which suits my requirement. Hence I am writing this blog to make the script/Content Modifier based on the requirement.
Requirement
I need to fetch the data which is in the Body, I declared the xmlns:s="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" in main and tried to fetch the data using content modifier. But the body is coming as blank after the Content Modifier step execution by giving the path as //s:Envelope/s:Body/.
I tried using the Groovy script using the removal statement by below code, but its failing.
import com.sap.gateway.ip.core.customdev.util.Message;
import java.util.HashMap;
def Message processData(Message message) {
def removal=message.getBody(java.lang.String) as String;
removal=removal.replace(/s:Envelope xmlns:s="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"/,””);
message.setBody(removal);
return message;
}
Payload.

Can you all please help me on this using the content modifier where i am wrong. I have highlighted in bold which i required in payload.
Thank you in advance.

Meer Hyder Ali
Hi
What you need is the Filter step, not the Content Modifier step. Add the namespace declaration to your iflow's runtime configuration like this:

Then add a Filter step configured like this:

Simulating this with your payload gives me this result:

Regards,
Morten
Hello Hyder Ali,
you can declare a content modifier and copy the body into a parameter, that you set as the body of the message.
If you use local-name() functionality in XPath you do not need to know the namespace of your selected node.

Parameters:

how to recalculate accumulated depreciation for capitalized fixed asset
situation

Hi Mahmoud,
I'm not sure if I fully get the scenario, bur in In general, if the asset has depreciation from before you joined ByD, the accumulated depreciation and amounts can be migrated. The depreciation computation is ByD takes place once the transactions are posted and are relevant for depreciation calculation depending on the depreciation method and period control keys.

Hi experts,
I am trying to create Automatic cleaner for Customer Accounts and their invoice, credit memo documents in Receivables Work Center. With clearing I mean change status from "Open" to "Cleared".I Found corresponding Business Objects (DueClearing, TradeReceivablesPayablesRegister ) which should helped me a lot but both of them are No Write access Allowed. When I choose customer account where I want to clear some documents and click on "Clear Manually" it automatically show me standard screen "New Manual Clearing" where I have to click on "Clear" button. So my question is if there is Business Object with this kind of action to allow me clear it automatically or if there is some kind of workaround ?
Best regards.
Dear Lukas,
What you have explained in the question is the standard process of Business by design where it clears the open items.
In case if you are looking for customized or automation of clearing,you might have to look for some custom solutions and provide specific use case as to why you have to do so in an incident.
Regards,
Manasa 
Hi Lukas, 
 If you want an automated process to regularly clear or 'clean' larger numbers of open Receivables, thereby accepting a certain degree of fuzziness, you could look into the application-feature 'Clearing Runs' (assign business-user to corresponding view in WoC: Receivables). 
 Here open credit-postings would be matched with candidate open debits according amount, due-date etc.. 
 Hope this helps, 
 Frank 
Hi Lukas,
As mentioned in previous comments, there is a standard feature named Clearing Run, that can be scoped in business configuration.
Apart from that, you could create your own custom solution with reuse libraries, as the DueClearing business object is not write enabled. For details, please refer to Due Clearing Utilities (SAP Business ByDesign Only) | SAP Help Portal

Hello,
I am trying to use AF_Modules/DynamicConfigurationBean to insert password value from REST sender adapter to later use it in my mapping. I am trying to avoid hardcoding this value in the map which is why I am trying to use this functionality to mask it.
But for some reason, it is assigning a null value. If I set the parm name to value.1, it works fine. But masking is lost.
What am I missing?
Is there another way to mask the password in mapping using a java UDF maybe?

hello all
this is a simple question but as I am relatively new to this formula stuff, please be patient. :-)
I also looked for answers in the forum and found some which I had already tried and did not work.
Basically, I need the following:
a specific work center in a routing, performs an operation in a prod order, that lasts 10 minutes and must be lot size independent. no matter what the quantity produced is, this specific Labor operation lasts 10 minutes.
I understand it is WC Labor formula related but I tested several possibilities and the labor duration remains on 0 even if I set it to 10 min.
Can someone guide me to this?
thanks
Hello Alisa
I wrote the following wiki explaining the basic settings that you should use in your work center for scheduling and capacity leveling. In this example, I have used formula SAP002 as the processing formula in the scheduling tab of the work center: 
SAP002 = Machine * Operation quantity / Base quantity / Operation splits
In your case, you would have to create a custom formula, removing any reference to the operation quantity, base quantity and operation splits, so the formula results would be basically the machine time (or labor time, if this is the case).
In your routing, you will then add the 10 minutes as the machine or labor time, and you should get the desired results.

I have set up Flexible Workflow for Purchase Order in the development environment including two test scenarios. Everything works fine in DEV. The workflow definition WS00800238 is transported to the test environment, and the scenarios has not followed this transport. When launching the Fiori APP Manage Workflows for Purchase Orders in TEST, I am denied change mode and the message is: 
 Modification is not allowed. 
The workflows were imported from the development system. 
Need help to resolve this issue!
Hi Joachim,
We generally advice to only modify flexible workflows on the development system for the following reason: 
All workflows for a scenario form one logical unit together. Let's say for example you want to create a new workflow valid only for large purchase orders. You create a new workflow with preconditions, move it to the correct position in the workflow list, activate it, and deactivate a now obsolete workflow for large purchase orders. If you do this on the productive system, there is one point in time when you have two workflows for the same conditions or one point in time when you have no workflow for the condition. 
It is possible (if you have only the productive system and no development system for example) to develop flexible workflows on the productive system, but you should be aware of the risk. 
If you do transport flexible workflow content to a system, we save this information and will prevent changes on the scenario from this point on. You can reset this flag using the App "Manage Workflow Scenarios" (Fiori ID F3067). Any changes that you perform on the test system will be overwritten by the next transport!
Best regards,
Mira
Thank you Mira,
This is actually what I have done. The standard workflow WS00800238 is transported to test successfully. However, the test scenario I have added in the App Manage Workflows for Purchase Orders is NOT transported. Yes, I have added the scenario to a customizing request created for this purpose in SE10, and used the "Scenario Content" pushbutton in the maintenance view SPRO (scenario activation), relased it and imported it to test. However, my added scenario is not showing in the Fiori App in the test environment. Thus I started to wonder if these scenarios are meant to be created in each system. 

DEV:

TEST (After trasport/Import):

Best regards
Joachim
Hi Joachim,
What release of S/4HANA are you in? I am working in a 1909 FP2 Enterprise Cloud system and do not have the "Scenario Content" button. I also doubt you need to transport a standard delivered scenario. What needs to be transported are the start conditions, steps, step conditions and agent rules that you define in the Manage Workflows app. I have been trying to find an answer to this for more than a year. I developed a custom flexible workflow for a customer in 1809 on premise system and that's when I realized the configured steps cannot be transported. Below is the link to my question. No helpful answer from SAP.

Hi Joachim,
Were you able to resolve the issue? I am facing the same problem in our system and couldnt really find why I cant add new Workflows in Test.

Hi Priyanka ... are you doing the Developing and Extending SAP Fiori Elements Apps course? Is this an issue you are facing with the exercise in "Hands-on exercise for week 3 unit 3:Creating an overview page"?
If yes, please advise at which point of the exercise you are getting those console errors.
Thanks
Ranjit
Hi Priyanka... I reviewed .json file for my 'Travel Overview' application and compared to yours and it looks totally different. Please review the course content again and ensure you follow it correctly.
This is what I have for the table card in my .json file but I am not using the northwind v2 service. I have gone as per the exercise instructions.
Hello,
I noticed that when we update BP catalog numbers with a large number of records it takes a long time to update even when we are inserting one new recording. It seems that ALL the records are getting updated altogether. Is it possible to only update it to add only the single row we added to minimize the update time with DIAPI?

Hi Xela,
you can use the DTW for updating it.
regards Lothar
Hi,
With the DI API it will be faster than the client, but developing an addon is not easy. Assuming that you do not need to performs such updates multiple times a day, you should think about the ROI on your time.
As per Lothar Hasenkämpers' answer, you can also do it with the DTW. It too is faster, but you cannot update existing BP catalogue numbers with it. I am not sure if you can delete BP catalogue numbers with it.

Johan

Hi, 
I am new to Fiori Elements and sadly our backend ABAP version doesn't support CDS views. So I am using SEGW based OData service with additional annotation file in UI project. I have a requirement to show smart multi input control for 'plant' field to capture multiple plants in an Object Page. 
I checked the documentation for this but it seems uncomplete to me as it doesn't has any annotation or metadata sample code. Could some one please provide an example for this case or guide me a little further?  https://ui5.sap.com/1.65.0/#/topic/04ff5b1a81344a8e8169ea99630ff4e5
So I have two entities 'Variant' and 'Plant'. Here Variant is the main entity which has a 'Plant' property and 'ToPlant' navigation property based on following association
<Association Name="VariantToPlant" sap:content-version="1">
    <End Type="ZTEST_EKANSH_SRV.Variant" Multiplicity="1" Role="FromRole_VariantToPlant" />
    <End Type="ZTEST_EKANSH_SRV.Plant" Multiplicity="*" Role="ToRole_VariantToPlant" />
    <ReferentialConstraint>
        <Principal Role="FromRole_VariantToPlant">
            <PropertyRef Name="VariantId" />
        </Principal>
        <Dependent Role="ToRole_VariantToPlant">
            <PropertyRef Name="VariantId" />
        </Dependent>
    </ReferentialConstraint>
</Association>


'Plant' entity just has two properties 'PlantKey' and 'VariantId'.
The annotation for Plant field which I want to be as smart multi input field is as below (removed some extra fields):
<Annotation Term="UI.FieldGroup" Qualifier="GeneralData">
    <Record Type="UI.FieldGroupType">
        <PropertyValue Property="Data">
            <Collection>
                <Record Type="UI.DataField">
                    <PropertyValue Property="Value" Path="Vendor" />
                </Record>
                <Record Type="UI.DataField">
                    <PropertyValue Property="Value" Path="Plant" />
                </Record>
            </Collection>
        </PropertyValue>
    </Record>
</Annotation>


Based on this, currently it shows a normal smart field with only single select.

BR, Ekansh

Alright. I got it working with following changes:
Hi Amit,
yes i solved it. 
you have to make a 1..N composition in the root entity like this:



and make an annotation with value like this:
  
the result in the ADT:


Best regards 
Sebastian Sobierajski
Hello Ekansh,
 currently I also have the requirement to map a Multi Select Combobox. I am trying to implement the 1-N association in a RAP based service. So my question. Have you been able to finish your implementation? If so, can you publish the complete annotation here? I would like to compare this with mine :-) 
Best wishes Sebastian
Hello - is it possible to hide the job req originator on the position org chart under Job Requisition Details? 
 Amanda Burton this KBA might be useful 2464841 - How To Change Order or Hide the Side Panels on the Position Org Chart (Employee Central)  but that will hide the side panel for Job Requisition details in the Position Org Chart.

*Please consider marking this answer as solution if your question was properly answered
Thank you for the sharing the KBA. I found that article the other day and discovered that its an all or none sort of situation. There is not a way to hide only the Job Originator which was what I was hoping to do. There are some situations where there are more than one job originator and this may be confusing for some of our people leaders who have access to the position org chart details to see this information. 
Hello Experts, 
In the Custom Cds Views app I am searching for a standard view or cube that contains the "IsObsolete" Field of a Contact. Unfortunately after my checks I was not able to find it. 
Does anyone of you maybe know where this is available?

BR Christof 
Hi Christof Blaickner,
Long time, hope you're well.
You're right, the IsObsolete field is not provided by SAP to be used in any of CDS intentionally and it won't be for technical reasons!
Please check this Business Documentation for more details stating below:
I hope this information was helpful to close this thread.

Hello,
I had configured a rfc-destination (TCP/IP-connections) in an S/4HANA System.
Technical settings: Registered Server Program 

Program ID: <Program ID>
Default Gateway Value

Hi Expert,
Could you please help me on below
We are doing a greenfield S4HANA 2021 implementation, Now regarding accessing SAP system ,we will follow Fiori first approach , still we need to understand one thing here
Do we need SAP GUI for Windows anymore? is there any functionality that FIORI can not cover and SAP GUI has it?
If we still need SAP GUI for certain functionality, then which user will need that.. For example Business user probably do not need SAP GUI,
whom from IT user like BASIS, SECURITY, DEVELOPER, FUNCTIONAL CONFIGURATERM need access to SAP GUI in that case? 
It would be helpful for us to know this in order to define strategy
Actually I am not getting any side by side comparison between SAP GUI on windows vs FIORI , to determine why the hybrid approach (Both SAP GUI and FIORI) is preferred obviously keeping in mid that it should be FIORI First approach.
Could you please guide
Thanks
Bikram
Hi Bikram,
GUI or FIORI is mostly more of how you wish to work with the look and feel and less of obligation.
Fiori has everything a GUI has with some sophistication and ease but that does not mean GUI is not needed.
As very rightly said in the blog There is no need to treat SAP Fiori as replacing SAP GUI – moving to SAP Fiori is not an “either/or” decision, in practice it is an “and also” decision.
https://blogs.sap.com/2021/03/31/sap-fiori-for-sap-s-4hana-recommendations-for-transitioning-users-from-sap-gui-to-sap-fiori/
The scenario is explained beautifully in the above blog.

Hi Experts,
We did have an OData query in our system which uses OData publish true, however it uses a different class.
Please find below the screen shot:

This used to use a custom class for exposure and that was the warning message that was shown. We were doing some package re-assignment and we ,commented the annotation: @OData.Publish: true and it seems it has deleted the custom class that was generated along with the configuration.
Below is the screen shot of the QA where the custom class exist:

Can you please suggest what is the process to regenerate the custom class. We dont want to go through transport import from QA to Dev as that would be the last option. What we want to understand is what is the standard process of generating a custom class artifact when we use OData publish true. I am surely missing anything.

Hi Experts,

Can i copy a sales order from existing ones? I am not referring to create by reference. Just create the new sales order which has the same information as the existing.

Thanks
Hi,

 You can create another Sales order with the same information but keep one thing in mind the Sales order number will be different.

I think this solves your doubt.

Thanks

I know you are not referring to 'Create by ref' but it seems thats the option you are looking.

If you hit 'Create with ref' on VA01 and goto 'Order' tab and specify the sales order number which you want to copy it will copy all the values from that order and create a new one for you.

And of course sales order number will be different.
Hi,

If you wanted to do this programatically, then you need to fetch all the details of the existing sales order and create a new one using BAPI_SALESORDER_CHANGE.
Hi guys,

I know what you mean. But if i create by reference, the field VGBEL in table VBAK will have the sales number as reference. 
Anyway, thanks for the suggestions.

Thanks
So I am using cl_salv_table=>factory alv to display some data in an internal table to a user.
At the selection screen the user has the option to fill in a language parameter.
So for example if a user is logged with EN language, but fills DE for the parameter, I'd want to display the information from the alv in German - That includes the name of the columns and all the content in the fields.
Is this possible? Thank you.
You can use SET LOCALE LANGUAGE command before the SALV factory method call.
Here are details in the ABAP help docu:
https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_latest_index_htm/latest/en-US/index.htm?file=abapset_locale.htm
Do not forget to change language back after the SALV display :-)
EDIT: I have to mention that according to programming guidelines: "Set the statement SET LOCALE LANGUAGE in exceptional cases only, and reverse any text environment switches in good time." ! Maybe someone knows better way to switch ALV output language.

Hi,
i've question regarding the movement of articles that has "Q" type stock and have inspection lot assigned between different storage locations.
For the article "XYZ" there is inspection type 01 assigned for GR. The parts are stored at warehouse and wait for the usage decision. The problem is that parts can be move into the production storage location via LT10 or MF60, despite the fact that the article is "Q" stock and has inspection lot. Is this a standard to allow posting Q-stock between different storage locations without usage decision?
Is there any way to disallow moving the parts with Q-stock between different storage location? Is it on the customizing or permission level? 
anyone could help?

I want to check if a record already exist in a table ( zcustomer ) by using it's primary key ( zzcustomer_no) before inserting a new record from the structure table ls_customer to actual table zcustomer. how do i do that?
you can use modify statement, which will internally check the entries before inserting into custom table zcustomer.
Hello,
You can use the code below:
You can also check the following blog from Michael Keller - the ‘X’ in the select statement
Just read any already existing record with a simple SELECT statement.  (or use a dirty ACCEPTING DUPLICATE KEYS or a dirty MODIFY)
But first check duplicate records in the internal table.

Hi, 
I am trying to create a simple regex check for an entity. 
My regex is
\bCHG
My test string is 'CHG123'. I am not finding a match. 'CHG 123' does find a match. 
Can anyone provide me some help regarding this matter. I have put the same regex into an online testing tool and it appears to be working there, but not in SAP CAI. 
Thanks
Martin
From what I can see, the CAI regex will check each "token" (i.e., each word) and see if it matches in its entirety.
So for you, if you want to match any "word" that starts with CHG, then something like this would work:
Just above the regex, it says this: "Your regex pattern will match for the entire token of your bot."
NOTE: This would match "CHG" when you entered "CHG 123" or "CHG123" when entering "CHG123". I assume this is OK, but if not we could use lookahead.
Martin ShinksBoth the links will help to find out Regex... https://sapzero2hero.com/2023/02/03/sap-cai-working-with-sap-conversational-ai/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mucijh8JAYc

There is logic behind checking order of field selection keys:
(from top to bottom):
1) Transaction field selection keys (ME31, ME32, ME33, ...)
2) Activity field selection keys (AKTA, AKTE, AKTH, AKTV)
3) Doc. type field selection keys (LPL, LTL, LUL)
4) Item category field selection keys (PT0L, PT2L, PT3L, ...)

Hi,
We do have a doubt regarding the Indirect access using SAP Cloud iRPA.
We have build an RPA using SAP iRPA that create documents, but sometimes the button where the RPA must click is not avaiable becasue of the screen resolution (it is automatically hidden in the menu tab). To solve this we have created using SAP itself a script to make the shortcut corresponding to that button, as with SAP iRPA we are not able to run shortcuts. 
My question is, is this consider as indirect access as the RPA is running an VBScript to create the document?
Thanks!

I am able to add script code inside webView where it will load as a frame inside app, But I am not able to add that script code inside the app of SAP AppGyver/SAP Build Apps to make it load without any frame as in webview.
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Sindhu
Hi,
At the moment, using the WebView is the only way to integrate it. After some testing, using a SAP Conversational AI Web Client in the "Connect" tab seems to be working great. 
An alternative solution would be integrating an API that calls CAI: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CONVERSATIONAL_AI/3aab817a03be4432abbfd00c42b23cb8/22d65b5127c54fb684d7962ec66af8bb.html Following this path would even allow you to build your own chat interface.
Hi Sindu,
Have you tried using JS component to the event where you want to load the app.
Thank you!!
Dear experts, hello!
I'm looking forward to be using GCTS in my company and I already customized it, it works fine.
But honestly I have many question about how to manage architecture / branching in it, it really feels like we can't use GIT to its full extent. I'm pretty sure I missed / misunderstood something as I'm no expert in GIT.
If I consider a simple landscape : DEV, QUAL & PROD. 
My understanding from the open SAP course is I have to create one repo for workbench and one repo for customizing. I saw 3 branching possibility but I see major issues on these solutions. Still I'm unable to find something satisfying.
1) One branch for each environment.+ one branch for hotfixes. Development is made on dev branche then we merge DEV with QUAL when testing is requested. When test is successfully done, we go live by merging with prod branch.
On simple cases, it seems fine but in real life it seems to not be sustainable. When feature A is developed then feature B is developed. Feature B cannot go live without feature A. I have the feeling that here we cannot work with a single repo for workbench. But in that case how should we divide our repos as there usually are interdependencies between our objects?
2) One branch per feature + one main for production. Each feature is developed on DEV and is pushed to the feature branch when development is done. The feature branch is pulled on QUAL system for testing. When testing is done successfully, the feature branch is merged to production.
Here, if feature A is developed then feature B is developed it seems to work fine: we can pull A or B in qual to test them independently. Then we can choose to merge A or B to production. But to a higher scale it seems rather complex to handle testing. If we have to checkout to the branch to be tested: we can only test on feature at a time in quality system. It cannot be acceptable on real project.
3) One branch per feature + one branch per environment. The same as previously except we can merge the feature in quality then in production when test is done successfully. It allows to implement multiple features to be tested in quality and fix the issue we had in 2.
The main issue here (and this is the biggest pain point on GCTS in my opinion) is we can't develop multiple branches in development system at the same time. If developer for feature A is developing for his branch: developer for feature B cannot checkout to branch B as it would "erase" feature A from the dev system. A solution would be to create different repositories, maybe one repo for each package would be an idea. But whenever there will be interdependencies (because it will happen of course) I think it will behave pretty poorly.
I heard about a solution using docker to mimic dev systems for each develop to be able to develop on their own system that would fix anything.
Any one has ideas, feedback on such topic? I'd be very interested.
Thanks for reading my text.
I did a drawing at https://github.com/larshp/two-alv-reports#full-monty on how to retain the flexibility of CTS but with git branching
Good afternoon, dear experts. 
Could you please advise, if there is any standard guide for expanding standard web services for integration with C4C from S/4 side?
In particular, I am interested in adding new fields to service CO_MDM_PRD_BULK_REPL_REQ_OUT.
 We made several attempts to expand the standard structures, but, in any case, the service fell into an error.
Thank you in advance!
Good afternoon Sergey Pasechnikov ,

Hello Anand,
Did you ever figure this out? I am dealing with the same issue and I have not been able to work out a solution so far.
Thanks in advance.
Edit on 09.16.
It is possible to make your custom rest service (not odata) work with oAuth. I was able to work a proof of concept and it appeared to work. I cannot share too many details on the configuration but these guides helped me get through the config:
Now with this being said, I had to pursue another route as this did not end up fitting my scenario, and the reason is the following. In my scenario I had my own SAP box, so not cloud, and I needed to communicate through a REST API with another server that takes care of Interactive Voice Response. The show stopper was that the oAuth flows that SAP supports (not cloud) are Bearer Assertion Flow (with SSO) and Authorization Code flow. SSO was out of the question due to some technical reasons, and Authorization Code flow requires user interaction (this is like when you use your Facebook account or other account to log into a 3rd site, that pop up that you get to accept the log in). In my scenario there was not going to be an user in between, so that made me throw this away. Now I also have to say that if you are working with SAP cloud, oAuth Client Credentials grant it is supported and you can find plenty of literature only on how to configure it.
I hope this helps someone.
Kr,
I am also same issue , please share details if any one have solution
 Rest API and we are the providers (using handler & cl_rest_resource) any oauth2.0( ) configuration -?

Hi All,
I have created as custom display profile for adding custom logical transactions. When I click on initial menu buttons , next set of menu buttons appear. If I press BACK or F7 I don't navigate to earlier screen. 
Also, within subscreens Back button functionality works fine. But for template screen above mentioned issue exists 
Can anyone confirm what might have went wrong while creating the custom display pofile. 
Thanks !!
Hi Snehal,
Check if F7 is assigned to function code or not for main screens. Hopefully that is the miss...

You can check the Fkey assignment to standard here

 The second key was not execute. What I need to do to create all fields after just one Post send?
Please see my attachment bellow.
Hi Thiago da Silva Moura,
This HTTP request appears to be the same which we use while inserting multiple records into a No Object type User Defined Table.
The issue is that it is not supported because the mentioned payload does not follow oData protocol.
As a workaround, kindly verify whether oData Batch request helps for your cause or not.

Dear SAP experts,
we're working for a customer subject to Italian localization and we'd like to understand how we could manage the cash discount. Basically, we performed:
1. Supplier Invoice Posting through app "Create Supplier Invoice" using std doc. type X1, for a net amount of €100,00 (VAT 22%) and days / percent. 30 / 5%;
2. Outgoing Posting through app "Post Outgoing Payment" using std doc. type ZP for an amount given by €122,00 minus €6,10 (because cash discount days were satisfied). Performing this step, we got the mentioned error "Doc. type ZP not relevant for any VAT Register" because in SSCUI 102451 doc. type ZP is not available.
Our solution could be to have three different doc. types (e.g. ZD, ZE, ZX) to be linked in SSCUI 102451 respectively vs VAT registers INCD, INCEU, INEXEU, choosing properly the desider doc. type for manual payment but this approach doesn't work for automatic where we have always a unique doc. type.
Have you any idea how we can satisfy the requirement?
Thanks,
Massimiliano
Hi
While I would say that you can add ZP to tax register as well as tax code, as the payment clearing process generates tax line items while processing the cash discount,  I also understand that the combinations can vary.
I suggest you please login a ticket in FI-LOC-CNT-IT, best practices for Italy and colleagues may advise properly.
Thank you so much

Dear experts,
I create an iFlow in DEV, activate and deploy it. Now when I transport the iFlow using CTS+ to our TEST/QA system do I have to deploy it manually again?
Thank you, Peter
Hi Peter,When you create the IFlow in NWDS, you have to activate and  deploy the iflow in NWDS.
Once the iFlow is deployed, you will see the ICO is attached to the iFlow.
It is very important when you transport to higher env. you should only include the iFlow in your CTS+. And then once transport is successful you have to deploy the iFlow in higher env. using NWDS- this will create the ICO. If you select both iFlow and ICO to transport , it will fail when you will try to activate and deploy the iflow.
Thanks

Hi Experts,
Need a help. We are trying to implement Workflow on SAP Build - Process automation. I am determining list of approvers with all match in the decision. However, the same i am not able to map into the approval step for users. However, when i change the same to a single approver in the step decision ( First Hit ), It works for me and i can assign the same to the list of users. Anyone has faced any issue related to this before ? In other word, it does not allow me to assign list to the approval step for users. Any options available related to this. I can see role collection/group option is there but is it not possible to assign multiple users as approver in the user step. I guess in classical workflow management subscription , it used to work.
Thanks

Hello Tirthankar, 
In SAP Build Process Automation, multiple users cannot work together as the project gets locked. So conflicts will not occur. All the versions are currently stored in our repository. For now you can view and export the project of any version, but cannot edit but going forward you can also edit any old version. There is no plan to integrate with Git as setting up Git is more of a pro-code developer but our new no-code tool come more embedded features for easier version management and lifecycle management etc. 
Hope that helps,Archana

1. Which certification I must do ?
2. Is ABAP still essential to learn the new SAP S/4 Hana ?
3. Is SAP S/4 Hana Cloud is an Advanced Version of SAP S/4 Hana.
I am totally confused. Kindly guide me a proper learning path
Thank You.
Hello KIRAN KUMAR
1. Which certification I must do ?
Certification is not a must, but nice to have. There are plenty of options - check out: 
https://open.sap.com/
https://learning.sap.com/
https://training.sap.com/
2. Is ABAP still essential to learn the new SAP S/4 Hana ?
Yes, it is. ABAP is a backbone of S/4HANA. Pure ABAP is just an entry point. On top of that you need to learn other technologies like CDS, BOBF, RAP, UI5 etc. Also some understanding of S/4HANA functionality will be beneficial.
3. Is SAP S/4 Hana Cloud is an Advanced Version of SAP S/4 Hana.
S/4HANA is available in two flavors: in the cloud and on premise. None of them is "advanced version" of the other.

We are using the following API to get the variable, but it does not return the value.

Hello All,
We have created many Live and import connections in our SAC tenant. Our source systems are B4HANA and S4HANA. Also excel in some cases. Our clients also use Analysis For Office (AFO). So whenever a client log into AFO he sees all these connections and its so confusing for him to select a correct connection to build his report. So we want to hide these additional connections so that these connections should not show up both in SAC and AFO.
Please suggest if there is a way to hide connections in SAC.
Thank you.

Hi,guys.

 When I was executing the report J_3RMOBVEDH, I find that the Debit Revaluation/Credit Revaluation Display during the wrong period , the Debit Revaluation line posting date is the expiration date for executing interface inputs, i know it was wrong.
 In other words , this report if I query this report by month, n the monthly statement, the amount of this debit revaluation is the same and equal to the amount of this material's debit revaluation up to now, Obviously this should not be reasonable, each month's data should be the amount of each month.



 I hope someone can help me with this question.

Hello,
how can I modify the journal entry after the creation of a supplier invoice?
Note that I can modify the entry from financial management modules, but what I want is to be able to modify from the invoice itself.
Any ideas ?
Hi,
When you told that you can modify JE, I guess that you can update some informative fields only: cost center, due date, remark,... You can not change the G/L accounts that are the key info in JE. That is system behavior.
In the case, you can cancel / reverse to adjust the wrong JE.
Hope this helps,
Son Tran
Hi,
Any change in the Invoice is not going to update the JE created for the Invoice.
You have two options:
1. Update the fields(which can be updated) from the Finance Module > Journal Entry and search for the relevant Journal Entry.
2. Right click on the Invoice and click on the Journal Entry option. The associated JE will open and then the fields which can be updated can be changed.
Since JE is a legal documents, once they have been entered, most of the things cannot be changed.

Jitin
Hello,
Thank you for your help,
for the first solution It Works, but the second one I tried I can't modify the JE,

In your case, you can use Reference Field Link function to reconfigure link between supplier vendor and ref2 in JE.

Based on what I read, SAP S/4 HANA is the latest version of SAP. Can you guide and advices me which one should I choose ?

It's great that you're learning Python, SQL, and Tableau! Those are important skills for a data analytics career.

Regarding SAP, it's true that there are many modules and areas to focus on, and it can be overwhelming for someone who is new to the field. SAP is a vast and complex system used in many industries, so it's important to narrow down your focus to a specific area that is relevant to your career goals.

SAP S/4 HANA is indeed the latest version of SAP, and it is a powerful platform for managing enterprise data. However, it is not an ETL tool in the traditional sense. SAP S/4 HANA is a full ERP system that includes modules for finance, logistics, sales, and more. It is typically used by large corporations with complex business processes.

If you're interested in using SAP as an ETL tool, you may want to look into SAP Data Services (formerly known as SAP BODS). SAP Data Services is a data integration and transformation tool that allows you to extract data from multiple sources, transform it, and load it into a target system. It is often used for data warehousing and business intelligence projects.

If you're interested in learning SAP Data Services, you'll need to have a basic understanding of SQL and data modeling concepts. You may also want to learn about SAP's data structures and tables, as well as the basics of ABAP programming.

I recommend doing some research on different SAP modules and talking to professionals in the field to get a better sense of what would be most relevant for you.

Regards. 
Hi Aina, 
Welcome to the SAP world,
You can very well learn SAP S/4 HANA, first, you can get some of the free SAP online courses at https://open.sap.com/ and then get into the real SAP courses.

SS
In addition to what Raheel suggested. SAP BODS is used with both SAP R3(ERP), SAP HANA(ERP). Also works with non-SAP ERP like a SQL or Other db based systems. So since you are working on learning python, SQL, and Tableau. I recommend learning SAP BODS over HANA. There are several tutorials online for the tool. BODI is a synonym used for BODS. Good luck.
As a beginner in the SAP world, and trying to get orientation in it you might want to look at this free course at Coursera:
https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/sap-technology-consultant#courses
Happy learning!
Hello Everyone,
I would like to know how can i get the response from SAP B1 HANA Service Layer during Insert, Update & Delete operation.
For e.g : If a record is successfully added into the database using the Service Layer then I should get something in the response like 1, 0, Incremented ID or new Object Key.
Same scenario for Update & Delete operation. So let me know your thoughts.
Currently, I have registered 1 UDO & performing CRUD operations through service Layer now every-time I am getting the blank response upon successful Insertion, Updation & Deletion.
So How would I confirm whether the object has been successfully added in the UDO or not.
Thanks
Rahul Jain
Hi Abhay,
Only the Add operation on Service Layer returns in the response body the full object you requested to be added.
Other operations like Update and Delete return an empty body response.
Nevertheless for all Service Layer operations you get a response status: "201 Created" for Add, "204 No Content" for Update, Delete,... in case of success or different error codes (3XX, 4XX,...) in case of failure. Based on the response status you can know if it was successfull or not and what is the problem. In case of success you can always send a GET request to double check the changes if required.
If you look at the Service Layer API User Manual: https://yourhanaserver:50000/ then click on "User Manual" link section "3.5 Create/Retrieve/Update/Delete (CRUD) Operations" you will be able to check the request and reponse format for each one of the entities exposed via Service Layer.
Hope it helps,Trinidad.
Dear Team,We are not able to copy the GRDC role template in BTP as the create role is greyed out. We tried to do it in Manage role section but no attributes are showing. PFA screen-shots of the steps,We have a requirement to restrict "define data mapping" in a way that specific teams can see only designated run.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
Dear Customer,
 
You can read about "Defining and Bundling Roles on SAP Business Technology Platform" for OP system on the following link: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_Group_Reporting_Data_Collection/e29950571a2b4065b1dacaf881c67413/c3401bd8e9354359a777b264d0b16309.html?locale=en-US
As a prerequisite for assigning roles to IdP users or user groups, you also need to configure role collections. A role collection consists of one or more roles from one or more applications and can be used to bundle authorizations within and across applications.
For more information on how to assign a role collection to a user group, see Map Role Collections to User Groups.

Hello,
We have some pdi code that is throwing error "Importing parameter STARTDATE is initial" when executing built in function "this.GetFromDB()". (The pdi code is written within EBO_ServiceRequest.xbo->root.node->Event-AfterModify.absl).
Does anyone have any idea how to get more information on exactly what the error means - is it expecting an import parameter for this built in function, if so what should it be? Thanks,
Hi all,
kind of a strange "requirement" or thing to ask, but maybe someone can give a bit more insight here. I'll first paint the picture of what is happening and what I'd like to archive. If what I ask for is stupid or unreasonable so be it, I'm just curious. I myself think that it is not possible but maybe someone else knows better!
We're within a custom, let's say report (doesn't really matter) and run through a process which registers some further processing in Update Task (not controlled by us so we cannot just hand over our values, registered by SAP Standard). We do not use "SET UPDATE TASK LOCAL". So a new separate session will be created. So far so good. Now after ending the main/previous session, the Update Task is executed. Somewhere down the line within this Update Task we run into a BAdI Implementation. In this BAdI I'd like to retrieve a value which existed in the previous session (the one that registered the Update Task to begin with). 
Now the question: Is there a chance to retrieve this value without previously persisting it somewhere? MEMORY ID, PARAMETER ID and things like trying to use a STATIC or Function Group "globals" (i.e. Top Include) won't work. Which makes perfect sense because we're in a separate session without any connection to what happened before and not just any kind of session as well. I wonder if there is any trick that'd work here?
Haven't used much Shared Memory Objects before but as far as I understood they wouldn't be the best solution either (due to: what if you have multiple Appl. servers). 
Any thoughts?

Hi everyone, I have PowerDesigner Repository -> There is two branches with Physical Data models (MAIN and DEV) -> in both branches is the same model (one table with one attribute).
Then I open DEV branch and RENAME attribute. 

Then I want to "marge" this change from DEV branch into MAIN branch. (Right click on Dev branch -> click on button "Integrate").

 Then I see settings window. 

If I leave Change list empty -> then I see change schema correctly.

and If I click on "OK" button, then change will be done correctly and everything is fine :) I have in MAIN branch wrong attribute name (ParTy) and in DEV I renamed this attribute to (Party) -> and made the integration between DEV and MAIN branches -> at the end I have correct name in the MAIN branch. 
BUT: I can not to do integration from DEV to MAIN branch without approvals. this is the reason why I need to create ChangeList. So in the integration settings window I set the change list (or just say "create a new one").

then again I see correct change schema (the same like in previous process). 

everything is fine and I click "Ok" - after that I can see change list. 

but if I (or some approver) open the change schema: 


then change is gone. 

no one can see that I did attribute renaming -> what approver should approve? and also it is not just about that change is gone in some view, but the change is really gone. Nothing happens after the change list is approved.
is it bug? or do I not understand something? because adding new attributes and tables works fine. the problem is with renaming. If I do branch merge without change list then everything is fine - if I use change list (for approvals process), then rename change is gone.

Hi all,
I'm binding the items of a table from the controller, but on doing this I'm getting an extra empty row in the table.
Then I found some references where they define an empty path in the items of the table like this and then as usual bind the data through the controller:

This way I don't get an extra empty row in the table.
Could someone please explain this behavior? And I've seen at many places where they define an empty path like above, what is the purpose of doing this?
I actually never came across this…. I guess this is to not bind anything as long as no data is available. As soon as the data is loaded in the json model they set the binding correct. The better solution would be to use suspend and resume in the binding: https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/b0f5c531e5034a27952cc748954cbe39
The documentation points to odata v4 but I also used it for v2 and I think it will also work for a json model.(to be validated)

Hello All, 
we have an issue where the AUC asset class has investment measure is active with Projects Systems (WBS) being used. The AUC was created with wrong asset class. one settlement to this AUC from WBS is executed. we would like to correct the entry and post the values to the right AUC. 
Since for investment measure is active, we cannot create a new AUC and assign it to WBS. One of the option was to change the status of 'Investment measure' to 'Line item settlement' in Asset class, create the AUC assign it to WBS. Then revert the config back to 'Investment Measure'. 
My question is it ok to change the configuration just to create a new asset and revert back? will create an inconsistency in the system OR do we have better option. 
Appreciate your repsonse.

Hi Experts.
I want to pass date range between today's date & next 30 days date while navigating from my custom app to a standard app.

Hi colleagues,
I would be interested on getting further details related to the technical shift that C4C developers will need in order to work with C4C version 2.
Is it expected to have JavaScript knowledge to work on side-by-side extensions which will integrate with standard C4C through API calls? Is this the approach that will be used?
Will SDK disappear?
Is the new way of developing expected to be as rigid as C4C or can we expect to have more freedom as we used to have when working with technical stuff on CRM?
Is anyone aware of when SAP will provide further details about this topic?
Regards.
Alejandro.

Hi   Alejandro Kinsbrunner 
As far as I understand there is NO C4C version 2, there is Sales Cloud version 2 and Service Cloud version 2, and both are diffrent systems.
For Customer specific extension we might have two options one is through AppGyver or SAP Build(they changed the name recently i think) and for complex developments SAP BTP Extension suite knowledge will be required, which has CAP(node js) and may be SAP UI5 expertise required( which means JS) also knowledge of Java and some other Web based technology is going to be very helpful.
SDK is not going to be used since that means inAPP development and Sales Cloud V2 or Service Cloud V2 are not based on ByDesign.
SAP will provide further details once they also have clarity, overall i feel there is many ambiguity over Cx Suite applications.
Hello everyone,I am quite new to SAP and I need some help how a potential solution could look like. We have a potential customer, which uses SAP HCM/HR on premise and we would like to synchronize their users/employees into our system. (basic user data such as name, email, location, team). The connection should be only in our direction. So we don't want to update their data. We just need to get the data initially and after that only if employees are leaving or starting at the company. (Is it possible to subscribe to changes?)So my question is, how we achieve that? I saw already other threads that our customer needs to publish a web service and we can then query it via ABAP. Is this the preferred way or are there any other better solutions?And secondly: is there any way to test this during development? As I can see SAP does not offer HCM/HR as a trial product. Any help or links would highly appreciated!
Hello All,Could someone please help me with the below requirement.

a simple way would be to create a CDS view for those two tables and expose it as an odata service. What kind of frontend are you trying to create?
Hello,
We are facing trouble connecting SAP Universe(SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform 4.2 Support Pack 9 Patch 4) to SAC. We are getting either a “bad request sent to the cloud agent error” or an “Unexpected error occurred.”
When we looked into the Tomcat error logs, there is a message "java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no sapcrypto in java.library.path". Does anybody know what this error is and how to resolve it?
We think we have configured the prerequisites, like creating an entry for the BOBJ CMS server in the Cloud connector and ensuring that port 6400 is open between the cloud connector and the CMS server. We also tried activating additional logs on the Tomcat server, as specified in the OSS note 2531819 - Troubleshooting errors with Import Connection to SAP Universe (UNX) in SAP Analytics Cloud but there are additional logs generated.

Hi ,
I am new to SAP Screen Persona and I am trying to fetch values using RFC . For this I was trying some examples given in blog - sample . I did all the necessary checks and wrote the same piece of code given in the blog for tcode SU01 . But I am getting error . I will share some screenshots for clarity .
I am using the exact same code but its giving error for me . Can anyone please help me with it . As what to do in this case .
Its giving error line no.4 as - Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'object'.

Good morning,
The blog may be old, but as I don't know which you followed that is just a guess. The below seems to work for me.
Not sure why yours wouldn't work, maybe move the field value retrieval above the RFC processing?
I just used this on IW32 on the Control tab to get the detail from last changed by.

Not sure what SAP's roadmap is but it seems like onPrem CRM, C4C is definetely on the path of "End of Life", If you officially open SAP Product portfolio there is Hardly anything i could find for C4C.
Basically I think SAP is just trying to "DE"construct CRM or Cx that you have to "Get/Buy" systems and just try to integrate them, for example SAP Sales Cloud i guess wont have any service capabilities or there doesnt seem to have one system which deals with Sales , Service and Marketing. (And may be customer master data).
Everything is "separate" and we have to integrate them with prepacked iFlows, we all know how amazing that works :P I would like to understand how you as a consultant or a Partner company or as a customer plan or see this from SAP?

Hi,
there will be version 2 of the both solutions Sales & Service Cloud. Please see https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CX?locale=en-US.
Best regards,
Kacper
Hi  Kacper Koralewski ,
Yep exactly those version 2s are I dont think based on byDesign or "old-OnDemand" solutions. Which can be very good since I think SAP had their fairshare of issues in that, IMHO.
However with the Cx Suite SAP is slowly moving completely away from overall CRM Space/concept. For each topic, Sales, Marketing and Service we have to buy : Emarsys, Sales cloud V2 and Service cloud V2. On top of that there is no migration stratergy for V1-C4C Sales-Service to V2.
Thats my opinion and i might be wrong but thats what i see at the moment!

Hi There
If anyone faces the same issue, please can you vote for the Customer Influence Suggestion or if you know a way around this, please can you advise?
Improvement Request Details - Customer Influence (sap.com)
As a business we need to know when employees have moved within the business and need to report on their previous and current details and determine the effective date of change.
Further to advice from SAP, we have created a Canvas Change Report to identify people who have moved Business Units, showing their previous and new business unit and the effective date of change. We discovered that although the report successfully identified people who had moved Business Units, the effective date of change was not always accurate.
This is because the functionality within canvas report will be based on the changes/effective dates within the Job Information portlet. If there have been other subsequent changes that may not relate to Business Unit but to a different field within the Job Information, the canvas report will show the last and previous effective date regardless of what the change is, therefore we cannot accurately report on the date the Business Unit Changed.
We had wanted to use this report if successful to identify other changes such as Band Changes.
Kind Regards
Gemma
Are you using the button that creates the changed field for 1 particular field only or did you go for the version where you copy the job info table + make a calculated column to get to the prior record (effective date - effective end date of prior record = 1) so that you will have the current and prior record next to each other (and then by filtering for cases where prior business unit <> current business unit rules out all other rows)? I'd always advice to also build something in that statement to check for hires + remove records that don't have the maximum sequence.As with the approach described you should be very much able to achieve what you are saying. In stories that concepts works very similar (which I would personally recommend over canvas)
Hi Jasper
Thank you for coming back to me. I used the change button in canvas for the Business Unit field as this is the avdice that we got from SAP, however I will try your suggestion in Stories and see if we can created calculated columns and rules to identify just Business Unit changes.
Many Thanks
Gemma
Hi,
I have requirement where I want to connect Successfactors and non-SAP system with SAP DWC. I am thinking on below options and needed some clarifications for each one of them:
1. Connect through ODATA connection for successfactors -

What is the pre-requisite for this?
Do we need to create connection for individual APIs or one per system?
Will it be push based connection or pull based?
Can we access data virtually?
For replication scenario, can it be real-time? 

2. Connect using Data Intelligence for successfactors and non-SAP system -

Can Data Intelligence write directly to DWC? How?
How data intelligence connect to non SAP sources


Is it real time?
Any limitation?
Prerequisites?

3. Is there any other way in which successfactors data can be accessed in DWC apart from above 2 options?
Thanks and Regards,
Sparsh

Hi Sparsh,
connecting a Successfactors system to DWC is pretty straight forward (one connection per system). Use the OData Adapter and connect the SFSF system via the connection wizard in the Space Management. Once this is done you can access the tables and build your required DWC data model on top of the tables/views.

Hi Experts,
We are using a tagged query to get the master data and hierarchy data from S/4 HANA (via CDS View) to PaPM Cloud by referring this blog : https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/06/sap-papm-cloud-introduction-of-query-based-master-data-and-hierarchy/ 
For one of the field (which has two different hierarchy names) , we have a requirement to filter out by different hierarchies in the processing part. But from what we have observed, we can specify only one particular hierarchy name in the ‘settings’ section of the field as shown below in the screenshot. This would not allow us to filter by the other hierarchy.
So, kindly let us know the solution to this.
hierarchy-name.png
Regards,
Soundarya C Adiga
Hello,
It is expected behavior to select only one Hierarchy for a field. Still, there is a way to see values coming from the other hierarchies as well. 
In case you have Hierarchies enabled for a field and you choose one hierarchy, you will be able to see values coming from the chosen hierarchy only as shown in the screenshot below.

But, if you disable Hierarchies option for a field, later in modeling and processing you will be able to see values coming from all available hierarchies (in your case that's two). Here is how it looks like. 

Then you can perform filtering in Show/Analyze screen based on the hierarchies you need if there are more of them and save different layouts based on the expected results. 
Hopefully this helps. 
Kind regards,
Kristina
Hi guys,
Starting to a little crazy with this. Using ABAP need to upload a BPC Excel Distribution template, and then change master data dimension members in it, and save it back to UJFS.
I have tried debugging the downloading of an Excel distribution template from the Excel front end, and I think it uses SAP Transformations (Call Transformation), but I don't understand those.
Is there a way to upload the file to xstring, and then convert the part where the BPC Dimension members need to be updated, and then save the file back to UJFS ?
I have tried FM's SCMS_XSTRING_TO_BINARY, THEN SCMS_BINARY_TO_STRING etc. but I never get anything readable. SAP Class CL_ABAP_CONV_IN_CE etc.
I have tried class cl_fdt_xl_spreadsheet, and I get the itab containing the worksheet contents, and then I tried to have named cells, which I can read using Method IF_FDT_DOC_SPREADSHEET~GET_NAMED_CELL_VALUE, but I cannot seem to write a new value using method IF_FDT_DOC_SPREADSHEET~SET_NAMED_CELL_VALUE.
Any pointers please ?
Thanks
Mark 
Thanks Vadim for getting back.
The business case is as follows:
We are loading a file set of 14 separate csv files from a remote Azure Blob to BPC in an automation process to BPC. These files cover Master, Transaction and Comments data for a specific Entity (Type 'E') which are country projects. 
There are currently 5 Entities (country project members) that we have to load each file set above.
When the all the data above has been loaded to BPC, I next need to refresh Distribution templates with the latest active country project ID's and email addresses for the Project managers (who receive the Distribution templates). This is done using virtual machines, (which is not my area - I am just BPC & ABAP). 
All of the BPC BAdI's, e.g. different Entity master data attributes coming from multiple csv files, i.e. UJD_ROUTINE having a driver file and picking up other master data attributes, and Transaction data where different Account (Type 'A') members receive data from different SIGNEDDATA columns in single csv files, again UJD_ROUTINE, and as you know as there are no standard BPC packages to load comments, UJ_CUSTOM_LOGIC to load the comments, and this is working fine. There is also error handling incorporating the inclusion of the BPC Send Email if any of the loads fail. 
As I said above about the need to refresh the Distribution templates, with the latest Project Entity master data, is where is am stumped at the moment. 
Of course I can bring in the latest master data, and import the distribution templates as xstring data from UJFS, but I cannot figure out how to parse this .XLTX (Excel template), change it to have the refreshed members and then put the changed template back on UJFS.
I have tried using cl_fdt_xl_spreadsheet, and get the template data to display in an itab, but cannot change cell values (can display them) using methods of this class (and then want to save the updated xltx worksheet back to UJFS). 
I have tried various function modules, e.g. SCMS_XSTRING_TO_BINARY, followed by SCMS_BINARY_TO_STRING, Class CL_ABAP_CONV_IN_CE Create and Read methods etc. 
I have just seen, a FM SMUM_XML_PARSE which I may investigate. I was assuming the UJFS .xltx file contained BIFF binary, but perhaps it contains XML. 
Anyhow you only asked for the business case, and I am also providing the technical means I am try to implement in order to meet the business requirement.
Maybe it is just something simple, I can be doing, hence reaching out to you guys for some clarity.
Thanks
Mark

Hello Experts,
We have a requirement in CPI DS that we need to to filter out certain rows based on the input of a certain column in another sources table. I tried filter out option in CPI-DS but filter works on single values. We have this requirement to dynamically filter out the values based on business requirement.
Example-
Datastore 1:

Datastore 2 (values to be filtered from column 2 in Datastore 1):

Required Output:

Could you please suggest an approach in CPI-DS?
Hi Atreyee, 
You can use the concept of Lookup function in CPI DS, wherein the first datastore 1 table acts as the source table of the transform, and the second table can be used as a lookup table. The condition for being able to use this function will be that the lookup table must be defined in a file format datastore or a database server datastore.
 What the lookup function will do is, whenever it won't get a match between datastore 1 (col 2) and datastore 2 (col 3), it will generate a default value that you define (like "NA"), and the lookup output will be saved in an output column attribute in the current transform. Let's say you defined an attribute named - "Col_Check". Then in the next transform you can apply the filter, Col_Check equal to "NA".This will filter out all the matches like abc2 and abc6. 
Thanks & Regards,

Hi,
We are using Closing Cockpit to execute the transfer of AP/AR , Inventory and WIP from FI to PCA. For the transfer of Payables/ receivables, there is a program that allows to select multiple Company codes (RCOPCA49) and the same for the WIP (RCOPCA33). I would like to know if the same exits for the Transfer of Inventory because the program RCOPCA30 does not allow it.

I think it is mapping issue related to this script, if you will have other types than "mailing" on source side then you will have multiple tags in the output structure.. You can avoid this part in "else" that produce output = ' '. 
Can you also provide source payload?

Hello Experts,
i have a particular scenario that i would like to learn more about. We are setting up IBP integration with external systems by using CI-DS. External systems include S/4 HANA and other non-SAP systems.
For S/4 HANA, we have no issues as we are going to use standard IBP<->CI-DS<->CI-DS Agent<->S/4
However, for the other external system we are thinking to integrate them by sending a flat csv file containing the data to CI-DS and then upload to IBP (IBP<->CI-DS<->csv<->Ext.sys)
Now, what i understood by looking at SAP Help (File Location | SAP Help Portal) is that flat csv files can be sent via ftp protocol upon definition of the specific datastore. What now is the problem is that to define the datastore (and actually any other datastore as much as i can see) CI-DS Agent must be installed to the server where the to be integrated system is. 
For some limitations, we are unable to install the Agent on the external system server.
Therefore, is there a way to send the csv file through CI-DS and then IBP without using the Agent?
(i know there is the data integration job as manual step but we would like to avoid using it)
Could you please suggest on the above?
Thank you very much.
Hello 
The DS Agent is required for integration with CI-DS. You can set up the ftp/sftp file location or explore the available datastore options to access the csv files.

Hi all,
In the existing code block i have this:
( si~pstyv EQ 'Z4K2' OR                  si~pstyv EQ 'Z4KA'  )       INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_stok).
Bu i would like to add a new part to this. I seperated it with OR as well. But i doesnt work:
( si~pstyv EQ 'Z4K2' OR                  si~pstyv EQ 'Z4KA' OR           si~pstyv EQ 'Z6K1')       INTO TABLE @DATA(lt_stok).
Is it because of wrong usage of OR condition?
Thanks.
Your new code with Z6K1 condition looks OK.
So it "does not work" most likely because there are no data matching all the conditions in your select.
Hi,
Problem: The standard managed update code generates an exception.
I have a managed entity for which I defined a custom action that updates some fields.
managed implementation in class Z_E2_CLS_BDI_RMS_QTP_UI unique;
strict ( 2 );

define behavior for ZE2_CDSI_RMS_QTP_UI alias registrationmessages
persistent table ze2_reg_mes
lock master
authorization master ( global )

{
  field ( mandatory : create )
  RegistrationUUID;

  field ( readonly : update )
  RegistrationUUID;

  field ( readonly )
  CreatedAt,
  CreatedBy,
  LastChangedAt,
  LastChangedBy;



  //  create;  
  update ( features : global ); "Note SDS - We do NOT allow create via UI but we do need the keyword to allow the custom action to work<br>
  // delete;


  action ( features : instance ) resetProcessingStatus result [1] $self;

  mapping for ZE2_REG_MES corresponding;

}<br>
I do not want the UI to allow an update - only the action should do the updates - so I added a 'global feature' check that always returns disabled. I could not just remove the 'update' keyword as then my action generates an error that 'update' is not supported. (Right :p ).
The action execution results in the following dump:
Header Information
 Short Text  The current application has intentionally triggered a termination with a short dump. Runtime Error  RAISE_SHORTDUMP Exception  CX_CSP_ACT_INTERNAL Program  CL_CSP_ACT_SAVE_TO_DB=========CP Application Component BC-ESI-RAP-CSP 
This is raised because the following method returns '4'.
METHOD if_csp_sql_write_access~update_w_ind_map_from_entity.<br>    UPDATE (iv_persistence_name)<br>        FROM TABLE @it_instance<br>        INDICATORS SET STRUCTURE %control<br>        MAPPING FROM ENTITY.<br>    rs_return = CORRESPONDING #( sy ).
The update command returns a '4'. Not sure why. The data looks ok and the %control structure has the right flags for the fields I am updating ( in the case of the action ).
The same happens when enabling the standard DELETE ... then the corresponding delete method returns as well a '4'.
Any pointers ?
Thanks,
Steven
Hi All,
SAP support reacted very quickly and provided the hint on why this issue was happening - thanks to 'Karl-Heinz Blumenhagen' for that - it all works fine now !
The issue was kinda 'hidden' by using the
I used the keyword 'corresponding' approach to test its usage and to 'avoid' the quite lengthy mapping of individuals fields. 
That lazyness backfired on me though.
Most of the fields were differently named between my table and CDS view (as initially generated by the eclipse service generator).
So the table field 'registration_uuid' became 'RegistrationUUID'.
Due to that 'corresonding' keyword almost none of my fields were actually 'mapped' - including the key field. Hence the SQL issue.
Unfortunately within Eclipse there is no 'warning' of any kind that eg the key fields are not mapped. That would be an improvement I guess.
Hi Steven,
without being able to see everything (tables, views, BDEF etc) it is rather hard to say what went wrong. A database save returning sy-subrc = 4 indicates a possible data modelling error, especially with regards to keys. I suggest you open a support ticket at the component indicated (BC-ESI-RAP-CSP) and my colleagues will be able to help you further.
Regards,
Jessie
We have a requirement where the data from Azure ( Service Bus end point ) is to be consumed into IBP via CI-DS.Am aware of 2 methods , Azure Cloud Storage and Azure Data lake Storage (ADLS) , also we have implemented Azure Cloud Storage where the data from IBP get loaded into a container in Azure .However we have a new requirement where we wanted to load the data from Azure to SAP IBP but they are willing to a Service Bus end point and wanted to consume in the CPI-DS Datastore .However do not see that any option to do so and additional the SOAP method is used for outbound and not inbound , also double checked and confirm that the datastore of type SOAP etc wont be visible under the source list when creating a data flow .I hope, I made my point clear , May I request you to please help me suggest whether a service bus end point link generated in Azure , will be consumable by CPI-DS ? if yes , please help me further move.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
To load from Azure to IBP, you can utilize the same type of Azure Cloud Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage file locations that you already used to load data into your Azure container.
On SAP side we are not fully familiar with other third-party products like Azure and the way its "service bus end point" works.

When you run the Manage Product Master Data App and hit the Settings option you can see many fields available, including Country of Origin. 
If you select Country of Origin it shows up on the initial screen but it does not show up with the actual values on the screen or in the downloaded list. The field will show up as a Column because you selected it but it will not show the actual values that are in the field. Is there a way to view the field with actual values in the app?
The field which is visible in the Manage Product Master Data app setting option is actually a retail-specific field with the source table as MAW1.
There are 2 country of Origin fields which are used in the Product Master App
1. MARC or Plant level - This field is present under Plant section and is maintained for Materials.
2. MAW1 level - this field is retail-specific and can be maintained only for retail article scenarios.
The field which is visible in the setting is from MAW1(retail header table) and has been added to the root view C_Product(CDS contains fields from MARA and MAW1), since only root view fields are visible in the setting, we are able to see only MAW1 field which is blank for material scenario.
To view the plant-specific or material-specific country of origin you will have to navigate to the plant section or to be specific International Trade section under Plant in the Manage Product Master Data App.
Hi Team,
is it possible to perform a query with $expand subquery in Odata v2. I'm following this doc: https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/expand-option
Query String: https://apisalesdemo8.successfactors.com/odata/v2/User?$select=city,hr&$filter=userId eq 'M2'&$expand=hr($select=city)
 I'm getting this error

Could someone please guide me, what I am doing wrong here.
Try for the first $select giving a value of city,hr,hr/city
and drop the second $select (and the parentheses), because the parenthesized nested $select is only allowed for OData V4.
(Or if the backend also allows you to use OData V4, maybe switch to V4 in which case your original query should be OK)
(My answer is only with respect to OData V2 and V4; I can't comment on what the backend will support but just what is valid syntax for V2/V4).
SAP shows the same transaction screen for Tcodes ME53N and ME54.
ME53N for display PR & ME54N for Release PR. But ME53N open in display PR screen mode for some users.
Some users gets proper transaction screen & some users not.
Please help
Hi,
ME53N use to display Purchase Requisition
ME54N / ME54 use to Release Purchase Requisition
There could be several reasons why some users are not getting the proper
 transaction screen for Tcodes ME53N and ME54 in SAP. Here are a few 
things to check:
Authorization, User parameters and System settings.
Regards
Hello https://people.sap.com/jagg12345,
It seems there is some Authorization issues for those users who are not able to see correct screen. For one user open ME53N screen and on another session run SU53 transaction to check authorization. Take the screenshot and connect with your Security Consultant to fix this issue.

Neeraj Jain 
Thanks a lot sir for giving your valuable inputs and time. This issue has been resolved finally.

Dear Expert,
I used the SAP table CDPOS to identify all document that has been changed at a particular time. But now I want to know to see the original SAP document through the changed document number.
For example:- The below-highlighted document is changed document number through this document I want to see the original document in SAP which has changed.

Hello Mohan Singh,
In this table .original document shown under column object value as highlighted below. Last four digit represent year.
You need this original invoice or something else. Please confirm
Regards,
Neeraj Jain

Hello Mohan Singh
"Document number" in CDPOS is just a change document number. The actual application document that was changed in stored in "Object value" - I guess that is what you call "original document" in your question. 
On top of that you can see the table that was affected by the change "Table" field and full key to the changed record - "Table key" field.
Best regards

We are in the process to implementing Peppol Invoices. We installed the SAP EFM formats in SAP B1 and partnered up with a company that that provides the Peppol Access point and is doing the format mapping. 
We can generate XML invoices successfully with the SAP provided *.SPP files. I can download the SPP schema, but this is a binary file that can only be opened by the SAP EFM.
Our partner is now asking for an XSLT schema. I can see the format definitions in the EFM, but there is no export function in the Electronic File Manager for anything.
Is there a way to convert SPP to XSLT?
I was able to find the relevant XSD schema on the following page 
https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/os-UBL-2.1/xsd/maindoc/UBL-Invoice-2.1.xsd
Client has 2005 A PL23. 

There are several BP's which have transactions which SHOULD have been automaticaally reconciled but appear not to have been and are still open. 

Scenario is that an AR Credit note has been created with reference to the AR invoice. The AR Credit note is still in the reconcilation screen - but with no AR invoice to reconcile it against. 

Please help
Hi Lisa,

this sounds like an inconsistent reconciliation. I recommend you download the IRU (Internal Reconciliation Upgrade) tool from the SMP. Among other things, this tool will highlight what has gone wrong with the invoice, credit note & payment.

You'll find all info & background here on this wiki page:


[BP account Balance does not match Journal Entries |https://wiki.sdn.sap.com/wiki/display/B1/BPaccountBalancedoesnotmatchJournal+Entries] 

All the best,

Kerstin
Lisa,

The possibility is the Invoice has been wrongly reconciled manualy by the user....

Please open Banking..Manage Previous Reconciliation..select BP..and enter the BP Code and check to see where the Invoice got reconciled.

You may probably need to Reverse the incorrect reconciliation and then link the correct one.

Also Patch 23 is quite old..please try to upgrade if possible
Invoice has been reconciled with an incoming payment.
hi Suda (strange I know)! CM is for full amount. 
 
I also have an example of an Invoice where the payment was made to the invoice (NOT on account) and it has not reconciled also.

how will i test the connection without any console tools ?

The plans is to use the odbc connection via node-red to the database yes.. i do this already using node-red on a windows machine but i want to move it to a docker container running linux. preferably i want to use alpine but my understanding is that the driver is not supported in alpine so i am using debian instead.
Have you sourced the SQLA environment, i.e., /opt/sqlanywhere17/bin64/sa_config.sh so that it is visible to the sudo environment? If not, this is expected behaviour. Here is a test in my environment where SA17 is only sourced with user scope.

Hi SAP Masters, 
In SAP B1, if I cancel a delivery document, will stock reverse..?
Kindly advice.
Hi,
If you cancel a delivery document, all accounting information will reverse including stock quantity & stock value.
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_BUSINESS_ONE/68a2e87fb29941b5bf959a184d9c6727/ac04609f828b411f93c2e31e9e58438f.html
Hope this helps,
Son Tran
Hi,
Yes, when you cancel a delivery document in SAP B1, the stock will be 
reversed. The cancelled delivery will release the reserved stock, and 
the stock will be returned to the inventory. Additionally, any related 
documents, such as sales orders or production orders, will be updated 
accordingly to reflect the cancellation of the delivery. It is important
 to note that cancelling a delivery document will not delete the 
document, but will mark it as cancelled

Hi

 In Item Master data it shows me different price list in Items Price List Column , when i create Sales Order it shows me the Price of different Price List for the item . How we can set the default Price List for Item

Thanks
Hi Sunny Brar...

SAP Business One lets you create different price lists for items, giving you the flexibility to offer your customers customized prices.
During the creation of sales and purchasing documents, SAP Business One derives item prices directly from a price list that is linked to a business partner's payment terms. When you add a business transaction for a business partner, the price of the item is determined by the assigned price list.
When you initialize SAP Business One, you define data for the business partners and payment terms as well as the price lists for customers and vendors. This data is revised and modified over the course of time, with the result that the price information used in sales and purchasing is always up to date.
SAP Business One provides 10 default price lists. You can use all 10 or just some of them. You can define new price lists and delete existing ones. You can also link different price lists to one another using multiplication factors. Maintaining different price lists for items makes it possible to set special prices and quantity-dependent discounts in each one, thereby letting you offer your customers customized prices.
In SAP Business One, you define prices for items in price lists. A price list is assigned to a business partner.


Regards
Kennedy
Hi Sunny Brar,

Please refer SAP notes:

1129133 - How to display a default Price List in Item Master Data

Hope helpful.
Hi smart people,
We have a situation that the procurement team using Contract agreement to procure items in which they have a defined requirement date (lead time) agreed between them and the vendor which is too long such that it can vary from 6 months to 1 year.
But in reality, a material can have only 15-30 days lead time as per the delivery time captured in the MM. So, when there is none in stock, MRP planning sees it as unavailability of stock and starts to create PR after PR in every MRP run, ignoring the contract agreement.
What' would be the solution to avoid recurring PR creation other than changing the lead time in MM in accordance with the contract lead time? 
Appreciate you valuable inputs and thanks everyone in advance.
Following are sequence for preference on creation of transactional data on picking data from master data. 
1st option- >  Contract 
2nd option- > Purchase Info Record 
3rd option- >  material master
Hence 1st option to change data in Contract  as you wanted for your PR creation.
I have a method 'CHANGE_AT_SAVE'.I have an include in this method 'INCL_SAVE1'.In this Include I am using call function 'REUSE_ALV_GRID_DISPLAY'.Here I need a hotspot click event but due to encapsulation I am not able to add a form.Is there a workaround this problem?Thanks.
Use an ALV OO class and not an old REUSE FM. You can add your own private methods and attributes in your implementing class, you are not limited to the interface of the BAdI. 
Just insure that the GUI interface is available to prevent dumping.
Subroutines have been obsolete for 14 years (since ABAP 7.02).
Use methods instead.

Dear all,
How use select and update statement while picking the records using jdbc receiver adapter in sap cpi, it means initial flag in db table as flag="N", once cpi will read that record flag will become as flag="S".
select and update parameter available in jdbc sender in sap pi, but it would be in sap cpi
Regards,
kranti.
Hi Kranti, After you fetch data from DB using JDBC adapter and process it successfully you need to call this DB again with JDBC Receiver adapter (it will be second standalone call to DB) and flag the records as processed using the field flag. For example: 
UPDATE <DB_TableName> SET flag = S where flag = N
Such statement need to be placed in Content Modifier. Make sure you only do it when records are processed by CPI to target system or you store it somewhere for processing (JMS or DataStore). It is also important to orchestrate timing of this pull and update depending on how often new records comes in to the DB. This is more specific to your exact scenario. 
BR, Piotr 
Dear Radzki,
Thank you for your reply.
Regards,
kranti.
Dear Radzki,
I did the same but only select statement working, update statement not working it means flag is not updating.
followed steps as below.
start timer-->select statement in content modifier1-->request replay-->jdbc receiver
update statement in content modifier2-->request replay-->jdbc receiver
both are with in one integration process.
but how both comes under single process.
kindly suggest.

kranti.

I can confirm that the Input Control for Cutover date is working inconsistently in Optimized design Mode. The problem seems to be that change in cutoff period is forcing to refresh the browser and not working with only story refresh.

Please see the in the Best Practices that explain how to set up the legacy date in the company code, create master data via the Manage Legacy Assets app, and then post the take over values via the Post Transfer Values for Legacy Asset. 
If you have a large number of assets then see the automatic transfer process in the SAP Help Guide, which details how to use the migration templates. 
Also it is worth noting when doing a transfer you post the cumulative values, APC at acquisition date, and cumulative depreciation up until the legacy date you set in the Make Company Code Settings app. 
I would advise to start on the Q system and do some testing there with some of the assets before you bring to P. 
If you come into any issues when going through the process detail them here and I'll check back to guide you.

Hi All,
Our client is using Upload General Journal Entries App to upload multiple entries at once.
They will be uploading multiple line items each month and every month there will be different GL accounts against which they would be inputting value as '0(zero)' in the amount field as below 

But while uploading the template with 'zero' in the amount fields they are getting error as below

So is there any workaround so that SAP will not throw this error even after inputting 'zeros' in the amount field against GL accounts other that deleting theses line items manually ?
Or is there any way so that system will ignore those line items which are posted with 'zero' amounts at the time of posting?
So can anyone help on this issue?
Thank you in advance
Regards
Kaustubh
You are reporting that error message An entry is required in amount field for account is raised when you try to post a document with zero amount line item in app Upload General Journal Entries. 
Posting zero amount line items is not allowed. The the source file has to be corrected.
See kba 2775054 - An entry is required in amount field for account &
Hi Kaustubh Belvalkar
Another alternative is to create your template in the Post General Journal Entries app using the Manage Journal Entries Template functionality,
Effortlessly, you can discard the items that you don't need to fill in.

Hi Team , 
Is there any option in public cloud to add asterisk for other fields in Business Partner , for example below is the screen shot 

Same way can we add for other fields as well so that user understand what fields are mandatory to create business partner .
Thanks & Regards
Suhas
Dear Amin, 
Thanks for your quick response, my question is to add astrick for existing standard fields in business partner. 
Thanks & Regards
Suhas 
Go to the IMG (Implementation Guide) in the SAP system and navigate to the Business Partner → Basic Settings → Business Partner → Define Fields.
Select the field for which you want to add an asterisk (*) and click on the "Change" button.
In the "Change" screen, you can find the field "Label" which is used to display the field name in the UI. Add an asterisk (*) to the label of the field you want to make mandatory. For example, if the field label is "First Name", you can change it to "*First Name"
Save the changes and activate the changes.
Once the changes are activated, the asterisk (*) will appear next to the field name in the UI, indicating that it is a mandatory field.
Note: Before making any changes, it's recommended to have a backup of the system, and consult with your system administrator or SAP consultant to ensure that this process will not affect the system negatively 
Dear Amin ,

Hello,
We have few scenarios related to leasehold improvement fixed assets that I'm wondering what the best practice/steps we need to take in S/4HC to handle them where we don't recalculate back to the beginning of the year.
1. Leasehold Improvement made adding increased value to the remaining term of the asset starting at the period of the improvement was made (not recalculated back to the beginning of the year).

An example, asset initial acquisition value is $120,000 with a 10 year useful life straight line depreciation starting Jan 1, 2015 (so $1,000 depreciation/month Jan 2015-Dec 2024). 
Improvement made Oct 1, 2022 of $27,000 to be depreciated Oct 2022 - Dec 2024 (we'd expect cumulative deprecation/month to be $2,000 thru the end of the assets useful life)

2. Similar to the above scenario but the improvement also extends the useful life of the existing asset moving forward (not a brand new lease/contract and not retroactive/recalculated to beginning of the year).

An example, asset initial acquisition value is $120,000 with a 10 year useful life straight line depreciation starting Jan 1, 2015 (so $1,000 depreciation/month Jan 2015-Dec 2024). 
Improvement made Oct 1, 2022 for $54,000 which extends the life 4 years from that period thru Sep 2026.

Thanks for the help,
Ryan
Dear Ryan,
We suggest that you can create a sub-asset and post the Improvement value $27,000 to it. 
Then use APP " post transfer - within company code" transfer the sub- asset to the main asset. 
Finally, according to your business requirement, you can add a interval in the APP "manage fixed assets".
Best regards,
Evelyn Liu
So I think scenario 1 has been answered as effectively create a new asset (be it a subasset or standalone LHI asset).
We still need guidance on scenario 2 however: 
The improvement also extends the useful life of the existing asset moving forward (not a brand new lease/contract and not retroactive/recalculated to beginning of the year).
An example, asset initial acquisition value is $120,000 with a 10 year useful life straight line depreciation starting Jan 1, 2015 (so $1,000 depreciation/month Jan 2015-Dec 2024). 
If we sign a new lease Oct 1 2022 extending thru Sept 2026, our accountants expect that all value changes would start Oct 2022 and not re-calculate back to the beginning of the year. How do we adjust the existing asset to make this happen (regardless of whether an additional acquisition is added or not at that time)?
What specific actions do we need to take with the existing asset to make it behave the accountants expect.
Thanks!
Ryan

Hi Mark Whately ,
So I've tested and can see how intervals can be used in concert with depreciation keys like LINS or LINR that are available in most 15 local tax and 01 book areas, but what about the group area 34 (USGP) which only has SUL* values and don't take into account net book value moving forward but original acquisition value? How can we address this completely across all areas of the asset? This happens for us hundreds of times a year.

We have migrated Fixed Assets during May'22 in S4Hana Public cloud. Client wanted to post partial partial retirement of few Asset now. After migration we have posted 2 month depreciation also. We use custom fiscal year variants (445) and only book depreciation 01 SLM. 
Eg. I want post 10% as scrap value. System is cacluating scrap loss on the accumulated acq, & Accumulated depr. value but not considering the posted depreciation values. Even for full retirement, it only calculates on the initial take over value not consider the posted depreciation.
Expected calculation
----------------------------
Cum. Acq. - 86828,67 USD
Cum. Depr - 53216.07 USD
Scrap loss - 33612.60 USD
But system calculates
---------------------------
Cum. Acq. - 86828,67
Cum. Depr - 51045.23
Scrap loss - 35783.44
Hence system is posting more scrap value by 2170.84 USD
Thanks for any pointers to solve this. Since it is public cloud we couldn't change period control values in the Depr. Key.(SUL1)
Thanks
Prem
Hi Prem, 
I think your fiscal year starts on 08/01/2022, can you check it? If you post the retirement on that date and it is the first day of the fiscal year, then the 3 months current year 2022 won't be included. 
You will need to post the retirement on the first day of period 04 and you should get the calculation you have entered above. 
Can you check it and give some feedback.
Kind regardsMark 
Hi,
No the fiscal year starts on 05/01/2022. As suggested, Again i had tried for Partial retirement Asset value date on 10/03/2022. The asset which i had mention in the screen shot have completed depreciation till 9th period of 2022.
Still I face the same issue of not considering the posted depreciation of 2022. SAP calculates only on the basis of initial takeove values. Partial retirement of 10% calculates based on Cumm. Acq. & Cumm. Depre values only.
Depr. Key : SUL1
Period control 

Don't understand what might be the cause of not considering the posted depreciation while doing the partial retirment. Appreciate well on the clear pointers.
Thanks

Has anyone outside of the EU used the app Transfer BIC Data to upload a list of bank information into the system?
I am located in Australia. I was able to get a list of all 16,000 banks that currently exist in the country and I need to upload them for the client. The information includes Bank Key, Bank Name, Street Address, Bank Code, Bank Country.
I tried using the app. The input fields look simple enough - see attached picture. 
For File Structure, I selected - Bank Directory SAP ERP (swiftrefdata.com), BDE
For Bank Key When Type 4, I selected - Bank Number (National ID)
These two fields seem to be the most important.
When I execute the upload, nothing gets uploaded. No errors - nothing happens...
Has this happened to anyone else? If so, how did you overcome the issue?

I did google but couldn't find the answer, hence posting in this community .
Thanks & Regards
Suhas
Hi Suhas Havaldar
The term ‘partner business area’ is used in a similar sense in Business Area Consolidation. 
The posting line of a group-internal, cross-company code, or cross-business area business transaction, therefore, includes both the ‘assigned’ company code and business area as well as the respective trading partner combination. Both combinations also separate the general ledger from the debit/credit totals, whose data is transferred to Consolidation. 
Elimination documents are then created there for each occurrence of the combination, and in Reporting. Create an eliminated representation within ‘subgroup creation.’ Within business area consolidation, subgroups are typically composed of all consolidation units within one consolidated business area

Edna Garcia

S4HC/固定资产转在建工程
HI，SAP专家
SAP老师们，我想咨询下，SAP能否支持固定资产转在建工程？
因为我们有机器设备资产需要大改造，想通过资产在转回在建工程。

如果是为了停止该固定资产折旧，可以通过app管理固定资产，选择该固定资产，编辑->估值->分类账->常规参数->启用 资产停用， 启用之后，该资产不会进行折旧。
然后可以对该资产进行追加价值，比如大修理，等。
待达到可使用时候，再取消激活 资产停用。
建议先在Q系统进行测试。
Dear Lizhen,
您可以参考连接中 冲销独立在建资产的结算 的部分进行操作。

Fixed assets were migrated. (Transition cockpit used).
The subject asset was impaired prior to the transition and is being depreciated on a straight-line basis.
Therefore, it is correct that the transitioned asset is being depreciated on a straight-line basis at the post-impairment amount, but it appears that the asset is being depreciated on a straight-line basis at the pre-impairment amount.
Please tell me how the transition would cause the asset to be depreciated on a straight-line basis at the post-impairment amount.

Hi Dileep,
here's an example how to fetch values from a get variable and JSON message, store them as dynamic header attributes and then use them in a message mapping, instead of value source get variable you can choose http header from the drop down in the REST sender channel
https://blogs.sap.com/2014/12/18/pi-rest-adapter-using-dynamic-attributes/
for an overview of other best practices REST blogs see https://blogs.sap.com/2014/12/18/pi-rest-adapter-blog-overview/
Alex
Hello Dileep,
You can use XI Dynamic Attribute for your header. Please select "Custom Attribute" and define one name for your custom attribute and then in "Value Source" choose "HTTP Header Variable" from the selection list and pass the name of your header which is being sent by 3rd party.
You can define up to 10 attributes here.

This way you can get all the data coming from the source header into one dynamic attribute "Head1" which you can retrieve in your message mapping by using dynamic configuration. Similarly go to your message log open the Message content and check for the dynamic configuration you will see the header value.

below is the code to retrieve the value:
similarly you can get as many as you want.

Hello naga kumari,
Check tax jurisdictions you specified in Customizing under Financial Accounting -> Financial Accounting Global settings -> Tax on Sales/Purchases -> Basic Settings -> Define Tax Jurisdictions 
Or 
Check in FTXP your tax code is maintained or not.
Also let me know in which transaction you got this error with screenshot.

Good night, 
I have a problem, when I'm going to export a Book in executable or scorm, Enable Now show this error: 
"Error while copying files [0x00000002] El sistema no puede encontrar el archivo especificado".
But the last week I exported the same book and it working correct.
Does some one know what is the reason error about?
I attach a screen shot with the error.

Hi Judy,
Is the issue only occuring for this one book and the corresponding book pages or it is occuring for all content in that WA?
RegardsShane
Hi Judy,
OK I suspect that the issue is to do with your Workarea.  In general, the easiest thing to do is to synchronise all the content that you have created/modified to Manager and then delete the Workarea folder on your PC and start again.  However, it might be worth trying to find the cause of the issue because I suspect that it is something to do with your current content player (called Trainer in Enable Now) Resource.  Try this:
1. Open Producer2. Open the Resources folder and then the Trainer group of Resources3. Right click the bold trainer file - I think it will be 10.6.11.5670 - and select Server Actions > Update from Server4. Try to generate the content again
If it fails, try this:
1. Open Producer2. Open the Resources folder and then the Trainer group of Resources3. Right click the 10.6.2.2265 trainer and select Set as Default4. Try generating the content again.
If neither of these options work, you can either raise a ticket using Component ID KM-SEN-PRO and try to get additional help or delete the Workarea folder on your PC and reload it.

Hi experts, I'm developing an app on SAP MDK for the 1st time and have gone through the tutorials provided by you. I'm stuck on the display page of an app which is the first page an user can see after scanning a QR Code. Requirement:
A display page which contains Company logo on the top, company name in the middle and Page footer to say that "you've accepted our terms and conditions". When user will click anywhere on screen login page should open.
I'm using Section page as I want to use the "Image" static control to display the logo.
Unable to display name in the centre of page (Tried using Title, Button, Header properties) but it doesn't fit in the centre of page. It displays right below the company logo. How to add padding in between controls????
Any suggestion would be appreciated.
For footer- I used footer in Section Bar controls, but it doesn't display the caption at the end of the page. It Displays the caption right next line after the Title which I'm trying to put in center.
Could you please help me with the below requirements:
1: display name in the center of page. Also, which control to use.
2: When user will click anywhere on screen login page should open.(same like OnPressed activity but for whole page)
3: Footer should display in the end of the page.
It sounds like you should use the EULA page for this purpose.  The EULA page is the first page displayed when the application launches the first time.  The user has two options, accept and continue forward to the Welcome screen or Decline and not use the application.  The page is designed to let you require users to review (ideally read) and confirm their acceptance before using the application.
This page is not part of the standard MDK metadata since it appears before the user onboards to the application.  It requires creating a branded MDK client that includes the EULA page content in HTML format or txt format.  The heading and values for the accept / decline buttons are customizable in the BrandedSettings.json.
Once the user accepts the EULA page they are presented with the Welcome page and given the option to start onboarding either directly assuming the client has branded in connection settings or by scanning a QR code to set the connection settings.
Hello guys, I need to retrive the sales order status:

Hello https://people.sap.com/luisrobertofrancomx,
Use the table VBUK to find the Sales order status.

Hello Gurus,
I want to navigate from Fiori app to GUI Transaction with startup parameters.
In short, the user selects multiple items (up to 100 or more) in the Fiori app and clicks a button. As a result, all selected item IDs should be passed in the GUI Transaction field.
I created a CrossAppNavigation service as per the doc, but ran into a number of issues:

The length of the URL fragment must be no more than 512 symbols (Screenshot from the official document).
When navigating, the parameters I want to send to the GUI Transaction are encoded twice.Example: The string "10,20,30" is encoded as "10%252C20%252C30".

I would like to know:

Is there a way to get around the URL fragment length limit?If not, maybe there are some alternatives to help me navigate with a large number of selected items (at least 100 at a time)?
Is there any reason for twice encoding?After all, the string "10,20,30" should be encoded as "10%2C20%2C30".

Would be grateful for any helpful hints/advice/feedback from your side.
Thanks

1.that fragment is for semanticobject-action, which doesn't include your url parameter. so you don't have to worry
2. can you show your coding for the navigation?
The easiest way to pass startup parameters to the target application is to add them to the URL hash. The maximum length of URLs is limited by web browsers and cannot change , (shortening of URL is possible only for SAPUI5-based Fiori apps that run within the same launchpad on the same front-end server)
 If you have a large number of parameters and / or parameters with long values, this limitation may lead to a truncation of the URL. To overcome such limitations, it is a best practice to store a set of parameters with a key, and pass only the key in the URL.
or 
You can make use of Personas scripting (in the target Web GUI ).
Step 1. Use Local Browser storage to store selected Items.
Step 2. In the target WebGUI Personas script, read from local storage and update WebGUI's selection fields.
I have not tried this but this should work.
Some E-Mail Providers will soon stop supporting Username/Password authentication and completely switch to OAUTH2 authentication. Is it possible to use OAUTH2 authentication with hybris mail configuration?
Patrick Tognotti
Yes, it is possible to use OAuth2 authentication with hybris mail configuration. Hybris provides an OAuth2MailService class that can be used to authenticate with OAuth2. This class can be configured in the mail configuration of the hybris platform.
is there any supporting doc is available?
Dears,
I want to ask if anyone know how to call rule from another rule?
Also how can I pass context parameter when calling it?
You can just import the second rule into the first rule and then directly call the rule passing the current context object to the second rule.  Here is a simple example.  You can of course call the second rule where needed in the first rule it doesn't need to just be as part of the return.

Hi,

All inputs would be appreciated.
Hi
I would suggest to look at the below learning jourmey
Learning Journey: SAP S/4HANA - Sales
What you could do is look for a job as an end user where S/4HANA is being implemented in area of Quote to Cash. This would give you enough exposure to the business process, while you embark on the learning journey. There after you could switch from end user/power user to a consulting role easily.
Thanks & Regards

I have 2 docker images. The base image of these 2 images are same. 
But the vulnerability scan engine (BDBA/Protecode) come out with different result. The SHA1 value of these 2 layer are same. 


各专家们：
上午好。
系统更新后，我们在操作导入销售订单时发现，生成的销售订单的订单号的顺序与我们导入文件的临时销售订单编号不是相同的顺序。比如：我们的临时编号是1-6，生成的销售订单号是446-451，但是临时编号1并不对应446。请问，是否有什么操作可以达到我们的需求？

您好，我们在新版本中为了加快销售订单创建的速度，引入了多线程并发创建的机制，所以Excel里面的订单是并行创建的，不能保证按照临时编号的顺序创建。可以问一下您为什么需要按照临时编号的顺序创建销售订单呢？是基于什么样的业务需求呢？如果需求是合理的话我们可以考虑在后续版本中引入一个配置，您就可以通过关闭并发创建的功能来保证销售订单按照临时编号的顺序创建。

Dear experts,

Any suggestions on how to do a 50% bonus depreciation on assets by configuring the depreciaiton key?

Example:

$100000 machinery purchased in 2008 and qualifies for 50% bonus depreciation. It is a MACRS 5 year property. The depreciation calculation should be as follows:

Recovery year Deduction
2008 bonus depreciation $50000
2009 $50000 x 20% = $10000
2010 $50000 x 32% = $16000
2011 $50000 x 19.20% = $9600
2012 $50000 x 11.52% = $5760
2013 $50000 x 11.52% = $5760
2014 $50000 x 5.76% = $2880

Thus, the bonus 50% is only in the first year which reduced the APC value of the asset. Then from next year it depreciates as a normal MACRS asset.

Does anyone have idea of how to do this? Thanks. Will definitely assign points.

Regards,
Vishal.
Hi Vishal,

The appropriate method is to use a depreciation key configured for bonus depreciation.
You then assign the key to the appropriate asset in the Federal and AMT tax depreciation areas.

In the multi-level method, AFAMS, either:
1. Add a new line for AcqYr = 2008; Year=1; Per=<blank>; Base=01; Percent = 50
 OR
2. Create a new method (look around, you may already have this one) for Acq.Yr=9999; Year=999; Per = <blank>; Base=01; Percent = 50.

Also, in the special depreciation phase of the bonus depreciation key, AFAMA, be certain to use BASE METHOD 0021 (special total depreciation rate).

I hope this adds more clarity to exactly what you need to do.

Kent Bettisworth
Hello, 

I am thinking in two alternatives. 

A.- Special manual depreciation 
I am currently experimenting with manual special depreciation. I did create a transaction type similar to standard 630 but including my area 31 Group Curr. After the asset is capitalized, you can use transaction ABMA - Manual Depreciation to post the 50% bonus. This option works fine, but require the user to create an additional posting. 

B.- Create a new posting key. 
Another option is to use a posting key created for this purpose. It is similar to what happened in 2004. It was an OSS note (505069) that describes the procedure. Unfortunately it seems SAP took it out from their database. I just took a look to Kent Bettisworth material. It is very clear and easy to follow. It seems to be bases on the OSS note metioned above. Asset Depreciation

It seems that the work I did for 2004 (allmost idem to Kent's) will work now without further changes. So if my test confirm it, will go with option B. 

By the way, I in your example during the first year just the bonus is depreciated. From my tax guy I got an slightly different scenario. You expense the bonus right after capitalize the asset, there for you apply the usual depreciation, in our case, double declining balance. 

Asset Value $1,000 

Bonus Depreciation (recognized at in-service date) $500 

Depreciation Basis $500 
Depreciation Key: 5 Yr, Double Declining Balance 
$200 1st Yr Expense 
$120 2nd Yr Expense 
$72 3rd Yr Expense 
$54 4th Yr Expense 
$54 5th Yr Expense 


Hope this helps.

Refered to OSS note on this and resolved the issue.
We are in the process of testing S4 2021 from 1709 and have found that when a material is added to a WO the Storage Location from the Material Master no longer defaults with the material as it did with the previous version. Has anyone else had this issue? I have searched SAP note and have not found anything related to this issue.
The only assumption I have is SAP has removed this defaulting code because they have now added as part of the WO defaults a Component tab that allows a user to set their defaults which include Storage Location.

Latest update for this warning. My assumption was incorrect this message was in the wrong position and has been corrected by SAP. Now when a component is added the Storage Location is determined before the EWM check is done .
See SAP Note: 3300888 - Mandatory storage location check executed before the default is determined, upon processing a Maintenance Order
Hello All,
We are in R3 4.70.
 I am trying to create a SES for line item 2 and the system prompts an error as per the subject bar.
For the same account assignment and G/L account details however I could post the line item1.
The only difference in the line items looks as the Order Nos being different PM orders .

Can any body give clue as to what needs to be corrected pls?

From what little I've found on the net, this is an issue specific to SF. 
My course loads and runs fine on ScormCloud, yet when I load the same file onto SF I get the error 'The Content Package definition is required in the manifest file'. I've been through the file and compared it to a known working file and it doesn't seem all that different - a couple of things that when changing didn't make a difference, so I don't think it's anything wrong with the code in the xml file. 
So I'm at a loss - is there anyone here that has had this issue and found a solution?
Dear Christopher Dale,

HI
 While trying to compile the github repo as per shine docs ,using sap hana web ide for sap hana (Sap hana express sps06) 
in the step where I started the nodejs apps - core-node,core-xsjs,user-xsjs,and then while starting the web app (fiorilaunchpad index.html) to generate shine role collections and sample data ,the web app does not start and i get an error as below from third party node_module http-cookie-agent file cookie_agent.js file ,the error is pasted below and a screen shot attached so I request the sap hana express community to help me as this is a show stopper (while deploying SHINE XSA)

 I have progressed further in Shine installation for SAP HANA EXPRESS 2.0 SPS06 
-=======================
So the above error I posted to happen because - the node module Http-Cookie-Agent is using syntax in js files like 
create_cookie_agent.js and mixed_cookie_agent.js - for example the vars are declared in the class - like jar; _httpAgent; _httpsAgent; these variables need to be commented out as ES6 standard does not allow class level variable declarations ,that is why SAP WEB IDE FOR SAP HANA is not able to build hana-shine-xsa projects web module (see above) , once i got past this errori could build and launch web module but see below 
---
There is another error that says the user running the SAP WEB IDE FOR SAP HANA in my case it is xsa_dev user does not have the role collection XSA_AUTHORIZATION_ADMIN even though the user is assigned that role collection already .. so on further investigating i came to know when I issue xs s (list services) in space development ,there is a service - XSA_DEV-elql9qtk8w1iwfcp-hana-shine-xsa-shine-uaa(created by userxsjs module ) and also shine documentation says to create shine-uaa service with xs-security.json file as input ,so basically these two services conflict and error happens so what i did is deleted XSA_DEV-elql9qtk8w1iwfcp-hana-shine-xsa-shine-uaa both services shine-uaa service , I again recreated XSA_DEV-elql9qtk8w1iwfcp-hana-shine-xsa-shine-uaa with xs-secrity.json file as parameter and then launched web module ,this time success i could create shine_admin role collection logout and assign shine_admin role collection to xsa_dev user logback in and i could launch the web portal 
Hope the above helps the SAP HANA EXPRESS community members 
thanks & regards

Hi Goutham Nagaraj Naidu
it is related to Javasceript ES6 syntax ,please read above as "....these variables need to be commented out as ES6 standard does not allow class level variable..." in my comment(above)
what has happened is that SAP HANA EXPRESS SPS06 is using newer node modules (node version ) and Http-Cookie-Agent (Node module ) is using < ES6 style syntax so as I mentioned I just commented class level vars decalarations (to be compatible with ES6)

Hello guys,

I would like to prevent users from changing the additional identifier field (OCRD.AddID) once it is added. So they can add a new value but can't update or delete it.

I'm unsure how to get the value entered and check it against the existing one. I tried the code below but it didn't behave as I expected. Did anyone have a similar requirement before and how did you do it?

Thanks.


IF
 @object_type = '2' AND @transaction_type IN ('U', 'D')
BEGIN
 IF
 (SELECT AddID FROM ACRD WHERE CardCode=@list_of_cols_val_tab_del AND loginstanc = 
 (SELECT MAX(ACRD.LogInstanc) FROM ACRD WHERE CardCode=@list_of_cols_val_tab_del)) IS NULL
 AND
 (SELECT AddID FROM OCRD WHERE CardCode=@list_of_cols_val_tab_del) NOT LIKE 
 (SELECT AddID FROM ACRD WHERE CardCode=@list_of_cols_val_tab_del AND loginstanc = 
 (SELECT MAX(ACRD.LogInstanc) FROM ACRD WHERE CardCode=@list_of_cols_val_tab_del))
 BEGIN
 SET @error =1
 SET @error_message = 'You cannot change or delete the BPAY ref no.'
 END
END

Hi guys,

What I need to achieve is the following:

- Block all changes in the field AddID where value goes from value X to value Y or from value A to blank.
- Allow all changes in the field AddID where the value goes from blank to new value.
- Ensure this doesn't affect any other fields.

Thanks.
Hi,

Use this concept to block:

SELECT T2.[CardCode] FROM ACRD T0 left join ACRD T1 on t0.[CardCode] = T1.[CardCode] and t0.loginstanc = t1.loginstanc-1  left JOIN OCRD T2 ON T0.cardcode = T2.CardCode  WHERE T2.AddID <> T1.AddID

Thanks & Regards,
Nagarajan

Hi everyone,
I wanted to know, if there is a way in SAC to generate a maximum according to certain dimensions and to be able to sum this result. 
Example: We have orders with lines items of quantity ordered and delivered on different delivery dates. The quantity ordered for the same order, line item is similar, while the quantity delivered is different each time. See picture

How do you do this if you want to know for a given month, the quantity ordered Vs quantity delivered? Because a sum will be right for the quantity delivered, but wrong for the quantity ordered
In the example, we should have an order quantity of 570 and a delivery quantity of 470.
Thanks so much,
Etienne Vionnet
Depending on your model type set the exception aggregation of your account member / measure Quantity ordered as None and Exception aggregation dimension as Date. Quantity Delivered should be treated as normal measure. My example below is from a measure based model. 

Output:
Detail View:

Monthly View: You have to create a Aggregated Measure in story


Original Quantity Ordered can be hidden.

Month Collapsed view

is it possible to use condition contracts (Wcoco) for something other than rebates?
I would like to create pricing records for groups of customers which are not linked to each other (GPO) and reduce the pricing maintenance, meaning to create records applicable for all listed customers and should then be used in sales orders.
I don’t find much documentation on condition contracts other than for rebates and settlement which are not applicable for what I intent to do.
Thanks
Hello!
I've checked note 3105025 for the new OpenID configuration available via transaction SOIDC. Note states: "...instances of "SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication" can for instance operate as OpenID Provider.."
As per my understanding this is not intended to limit only this configuration for IAS. The problem that I'm facing when setup the scenario is that the claim 'sub' seems to be hardcoded and used for the mapping to the ABAP users based on email, alias, etc.
This specific claim 'sub' is reserved in Azure AD for example and it contains some string that varies according to the user and the application, hence is not intended to be used for mapping. Has somebody setup this scenario with an OpenID provider like Azure AD?
Thanks

HI all,
is there any guide / tutorial step by step upgrading CCC Version & SAP version, 
for example from 9.3 to 10, what's the best practice step by step and the most low cost & less downtime for customer.
I've read the Admin Guide CCC but it's too straight forward, 
maybe is there anyone experience this & can share your experience ? what's the difficulty / obstacle that you face when upgrading the version ?

Hello CAP and UI5 Experts, I am tasked with exploring OData V4 capability in SAP CAP Node.JS specifically around rendering Analytical Charts or Cards. 
As of now, I do not have access to a SAP HANA Cloud instance or SQLite DB in Production (other than of course in BAS for testing).
I am mashing together a few techniques to try to visualize data without relying on a database to calculate functions for me, such as SUM, COUNTDISTINCT, etc.
Disclaimer: We do understand HANA Cloud calculation capability may be required for this PoC, but trying to see how far we can get without it, if possible. We are trying to minimize the data replication needs from S/4 to HANA Cloud to calculate our measures.
Here is the code to review:

Curious to know why I cannot populate my own "Counter" for testing purposes and why it is automatically aliased as "CounterAggregate" When I try to adjust the code to "CounterAggregate", I either receive "field not valid in the modeling" errors or it becomes aliased "CounterAggregateAggregate" :-)
Begs the question - Can OData v4 be used for OVP or is it still a roadmap item? I do not have these issues with OData v2 OVP and annotations in the same project.
Am I missing some Chart config in the manifest that can help adjust the behavior of the Apply Aggregate Sum functionality?
Thanks for looking everyone, Have a great weekend!
Scott
This was resolved by Debugging the OVP source and correcting analytical annotations at the CAP layer.
Upon receiving data, (sap.ovp.cards.v4.charts.OVPVizDataHandler) Dimensions and Measures are extracted from the annotated OData service, looking for this annotation: @com.sap.vocabularies.Analytics.v1.Measure.
So far, in CAP, The way to generate those annotations is NOT to use "@AnalyticalContext.Dimension: true" but TO use "@Analytics.Dimension: true". The same is true for "@AnalyticalContext.Measure: true" and "@Analytics.Measure: true".
Also, returning data in your service handler, you need to use the generated "<property>Aggregate" property, in my example "CounterAggregate." The OVP source will do the translation and move the data from this generated OData v4 dynamic property to the modeled "Counter" property in the service definition.

Hi ,
I made a tile for TCODE LS03n in my fiori launchpad. On the load of screen I have a tab strip menu and I want to hide my default tab on the load of screen . so I added an script and bind it with onLoad event . That script is not giving any error on executing but its also not reflecting changes on fiori screen . But I checked in GUI screen there the changes are reflecting as per the script .
For clarity I am attaching the screenshots below:
1. First screenshot is the desired results which I am getting after writing that script but its only reflecting on GUI screen 
2. Its screen which loads after writing that script and lastly the screenshot of the script is also attached.


Good day!
I think, the problem is that you are hiding the currently active tab, which is not possible. Only inactive tabs can be hidden using SAP Screen Personas.  Therefore, before hiding the "Storage Bin" tab, please  add a script statement that switches to the "Stock" tab (or other visible tan).

Hello everyone.
Is it possible to extract through a Story report in People Analytics information from Job Profile Builder? About sections in the job template.
Thanks in advance.
Hello Ignacio Padilla Esteban -
 Thank you for your question. Job Profile Builder data can be accessed in Story. However, Stories is not an export tool and I would not recommend you use it for that purpose.
If you want to report on JPB data and make decisions in the system, that is something you can do.Thanks!Ben

Hi experts,
I am creating an alert to show for HR when doing a termination of a supervisor.
My rule specifies that it should trigger on event reason "supervisor change" however the alert triggers on all terminations, not only supervisor changes. Any way to restrict the alert?
Thanks!
Br,
Ines
Normally if you specify the event reason, that should already help the alert.What does your rule look like and on what portlet is it set? The issue may for instance be that you use it on empemployment, while job info might be more suitable (but its hard to tell without seeing what you have right now).

Hi,
We have an Android platform MDK application which has push notifications. We are registering the app to receive push notifications and it all works fine, showing the received content in a Message popup.
However, we need to perform some actions when certain notifications are received, so I have started investigating how to do this and I've found this information https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/features/push/mdk/push.html which seems to suggest using an Event Handler to catch the received Notification and deal with it manually. My question is, where do I call this Event Handler or how do I tell my app to use it when a notification is received, as I cannot get it to run when I send test notifications?
Thanks
John
Push Notification Event handlers are defined in your MDK application in the Application.app properties.  Create a new rule for the specific handler event and follow the documentation you referenced to get the event data and payload from the push message.  
You can then take appropriate action within your MDK application based on the payload and your business logic,
Hello Experts,
Our backend system is SAP SRM system with 500 plus interfaces in SAP PO 7.5 single stack.
Also we are planning to migrate SAP SRM to S/4 HANA system. Parallely should we plan to migrate SAP PO to SAP Integration Suite. Our management asked to do impact analysis from SAP PO to SAP Integration Suite.
Could you pls share some inputs regarding the same, some thoughts, risk mitigation and so on.
Regards.
Hi Ramu, 
this is broad topic and with all respect to SAP Community this is more consulting service scope than QA topic :) 
You need to take a lot of aspects into considerations and analyze current interfaces with focus on integration pattern, type, styles, authentication, authorization, encryption, mapping complexity, cloud or on-prem, volume, mapping methods, UDFs, adapter modules, level of customization, frequency and so on. 
Please start with below blogs and help guides:

Hi All,
I am coming from PI/PO background and as you know that in PI/PO we can persist messages as long as we need for instance, 90 days. How does this work in CPI? Can we configure CPI in Cloud Foundry to persist message for 90 days? We may want to use this for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.
Also, we enabled Cloud TMS service for transports across DEV/QA/PROD. We noticed that anyone with the Developer role still has access to manual upload and download of artifacts. This will defeat the purpose of having TMS service with good auditing. Is there any way we can configure CPI to use only TMS and reject the manual option?
For TMS, you have to define your developer role at a granular level. You have remove roles that provide ability to import and export.
Refer to - https://help.sap.com/docs/CLOUD_INTEGRATION/368c481cd6954bdfa5d0435479fd4eaf/556d5575d4b0483e85d4f3251f21d0ec.html
For logs, the default is 1GB per tenant I believe. Anytime logs go beyond that, the older logs get deleted. If you want them to be available, you would have send them to another logging system using APIs

As your question is in fact how to make SAP GUI 32 bits work with Office VBA 64 bits.
Before SAP GUI 7.70, you can use DLL Surrogates, see these links, all are about the same thing (just few variations):
From SAP GUI 7.70, you may avoid DLL Surrogates, it depends which controls are migrated to 64 bits (I think 7.70 should be fine for RFC):

What are the best practices when creating new users in SAP? We have development, QA, and production systems in place when testing new user accounts and roles does it make sense to work in development and then transport to them to production? Also when we have a mature system is it best to just create users in production?
Hello Jonathan Brotto,
Please refer below SAP threads to understand best practices when creating new users.
https://answers.sap.com/questions/9904917/best-practice-for-user-management-in-sap-hana-db.html
https://answers.sap.com/questions/7261101/sap-security-and-user-management-best-practices.html
Regards,
Neeraj Jain
Dear Jonathan Brotto,
In my opinion best way is to create user in QA and then move it to production.
This way same users are created in both systems and as users might need to test some process in future in QA, you don't have to create user separately. 
In regard to basic end-users and development -> I think this is not necessary as development is used only by consultants / IT support members.
Hello,
I am working on this tutorial: Access a Classic Schema from SAP Business Application Studio . Before working on this tutorial last night, I selected the option to upgrade the cloud instance.

I tried to view the dashboard of the cloud instance, but then the system issued "Invalid Credentials". 
 I just worked on the previous tutorial the night before and had no problems with the DB module. 
Please help resolve the issue. I don't think I can open a ticket based on a trial account.

Hi Friends,
I need to update/change the values in the table /GRCPI/GRIA_CON. what is the Tcode to update/change the values in that table.
Thanks with Regards,
Vallamuthu M
Hi vallamuthu madheswaran 
There are multiple ways to update table. Generally you can update by going to Se16 Tcode, execute and there is create entries button on top but as this is standard table, you need to check if table maintenance is allowed for this. Only then you can change. Please follow below steps and try:
Goto Se11, enter table name /GRCPI/GRIA_CON, then click System(Top menu bar)-> Services - > Table Maintenance - > Extend Table maintenance - > then click display at bottom - >then there is edit/display button on top which allows to edit values or create new one.

I have two data sources built into a report.
Data source one is the main report with its own headers.
 grouped by a customer number
Data source two is a sub report with its own headers.
 grouped by a customer number
I have them linked by customer number and i get 100 % of the main report.
If there is not a match in the sub report i get a sub report header but no data, which is accurate but not desirable
I would like to be able to split this into two report outputs , one with matches in the sub report and one with no match in the sub report.
Update the subreport so that the header you're using there is suppressed if there is no data in the subreport.  I would put something similar to this in the supression formula there:

By running Activation Log of Domain-Text20 , we got some Dependent table.
To activate those Dependent table we use Tcode- SE14. 
But after running SE14 tcode we are getting Short dumps in SAP system 
Could you share more info regarding the dumps ..
Hi Raju,

Can you please tell what exact error message are you getting at domain level activation if its's activated without any error message the try to activate Data element if you are trying to activate through table. Also request you to please share screenshot of Dump details or Domain level activation issue. 

Also please check below link which may help you to solve your issue.

Hi Raju,

Try activating the database table in SE14 using Background Processing Type. If it does not work please check with your basis consultant whether they can revert the domain to its original format. This will result in table data loss. But it order to avoid the run time errors this is the best option.

Hi Friends,
I have a couple of questions on the migration of DMEE tree during a system conversion scenario (upgrade from ECC to S/4HANA)
We wish to convert and continue using DMEE and also wish to avoid upload / download of DMEE tree and conversion to DMEEX. I have searched through multiple OSS notes but have not found any clear understanding on the following:

Whether continued use of DMEE is an option after upgrading to S/4HANA or converting to DMEEX is mandatory
Whether DMEE tree as-is, will be converted automatically during the system conversion and can be activated without any issues Or
Is the Download/Upload using XML the only option to move DMEE tree from ECC to S/4HANA

Hey Team,
As I am creating a simulation in "practice mode", when I play back my sim, sometimes the screen will move with the explanation buttons and then the action bubbles keep the screen in the same location. Which setting is specific for where the screen focuses on the bubble?
Best
Also, just reading your comment now, I'm now thinking that it could also be that your screen size might not be set optimally.
"...when I start my sim in practice mode the screenshot shifts to the side instead of being centered. " 
If your screen is moving around while playing a Simulation you might want to try a different size when you record (or manually enter the Width and Height). 
Ideally, you should be able to see the whole target screen in the simulation while it's playing, without having to move around (whether it's Demo or Practice mode). 

iz
Hi Andrew,
In Authoring Settings > Recordings, check the box for Practice Bubble at Element. 
This will keep the Practice Mode bubbles closer to the referenced element in Demo mode. You might still need to review, but in your situation it seems like a better option than the Practice Mode bubbles automatically placed in the middle.
See below for a screen print of the Settings.

Best regards, 
- Robert Way
I resolved the "moving around" issue when playing a simulation by changing the DPI on the start step of the simulation.  Changing it to 200% and uncropping all the screens gives a nice playback experience.  Note that 200% will make the generated video too small, so I change it back to 100% for video generation.

However, I cannot remove the "User-specific" tick (see screenshot).As far as I can see I need the Authorization Object "S_ALV_LAYO"How can I apply this to the user? I don't get it which platform is necessary now. The CIS or the ATP and if I need ABAP for this?
Many thanks for your help.
Many greetings
Hi Manuel,
In S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, the access is controlled via the roles you have assigned to your user. In order get access to remove the user specific flag on the save layout screen, try assigning the extensibility specialist role with write access to your user. I believe the catalog you need is SAP_CORE_BC_EXT_ALV_PC which is in this role.
Regards,
Dennis
PS: the screenshot you shared was not visible
Hi Manuel,
To add more details on what Dennis also indicated.
Layouts in "Display Warehouse" requires a special character "/" to not to be considered user specific.

So when creating them, uncheck the box and also start it with "/".  

Hope this helps,

Hi All,
In our scenario we are connecting to external HTTP services from our S/4 system.
We are recieving error from this external server.
Now we want to enable the HTTP traces to view the HTTP response being sent by the external server.
Are the HTTP responses being captured in ICM traces level 1 ? Or in level 3 ?
If not what else can we do ?
Best Regards,
Saurav

If you get a response, then the connection succeeded and ICM will give you no information about the content of the response.
How do you call the http service? With the if_http_client you can „receive“ the response, then also „get_last_error“ and „get_cdata“ for http body.
You could also set up the http call in SM59 with the full url (length is limited though and no parameters) and try the connection there and get those results.
If indeed you are having connection issues, I would recommend temporary increasing completely the error level and look for your url in the trace.
With level 3 of ICM trace, you see the exact contents of HTTP requests and responses.
EDIT February 2023: I was wrong.
Hi,
Now I need to create multi POs using one line in third party PR, if it is possible.
Dear Abanob Atef,
You need to create N POs from 1 PR, right? 
Let's say PR is for 100 pcs, you can create 10 POs with 10 pcs in each PO.
You can do it directly from MD04 -> double click on PR -> Purchase order -> then you can reduce qty directly in PO (for example from 100 pcs to 10 pcs)
Hello Abanob Atef,
As suggested by  Stepan Kadera you can do that activity to meet your requirement.
or
In the sale order you need to create different line items for different quantities to create each PR/PO automatically for your quantity delivered to customer as it's not feasible to create multiple PO's for single PR. Think, how  the system recognize/knows for which different quantities system needs to create multiple PO's with single PR?

Hi all,
How does one typically deal with contractor superannuation payments in Australia?
We set up the contractors as vendors and pay invoices, but for some contractors we need to pay superannuation payments directly to their fund. (https://www.ato.gov.au/business/super-for-employers/work-out-if-you-have-to-pay-super/super-for-contractors/)
So ideally we would like the superannuation reports to handle this, but are concerned about unintended consequences of configuring contractors as employees.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
Cheers
Hello Bill Blankenship,
Please refer below SAP Blog and thread. Might be you will get some insights.

Hi , 
i have an issue with my BI : 
The following database error occured (CS) Java exception java lang runtime exception :
Com.sap.db.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc40.sqlinvalidAuthorizationSpecException : 10..:authentication failed.
Any idea please ?
thanks
That error usually comes up if you try to use SAML SSO to HANA, but don't have it configured properly.
Go through this wiki, and make sure that you're able to test connect successfully from CMC -> Applications -> HANA Authentication
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/SAPHANA/SAML+SSO+for+BI+Platform+to+HANA
In the case of your BI database error, the specific exception com.sap.db.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc40.sqlinvalidAuthorizationSpecException indicates that there is an issue with the authentication credentials used to connect to the database. This error occurs when the login credentials supplied for the database are invalid or the user does not have the necessary privileges to access the database.
To resolve this java runtime exception, you should check the username and password being used to connect to the database, and verify that the user account has the appropriate permissions to access the database. You may also want to check that the database is running and that you have a stable network connection to the server. If none of these steps help to resolve the issue, you may need to contact your BI support team or database administrator for further assistance.
Hello everybody, i would like to create attachments in ME21N and see those same attachments when i open the inbound delivery transaction VL33N or VL06 I. Is this possible somehow? 
Dear Cpi Experts,
How to connect and transfer the data from On-Premise SAP ECC(outbound service) to CPI with out exposing ECC server in net.
and we are able to transfer data from CPI to On-Premise SAP ECC(inbound) using cloud connector .
kindly suggest.
Regards,
kranti.
Hi Kranti,
Outbound communication from SAP ERP (ECC, S/4HANA) usually is not considered to be exposing ERP to internet threats because the call is initiated within the network.
But if this is a concern, you can use a third-party on-premise application as a proxy (or a proxy) to get internet access. Alternatively, you can request an exception to allow outbound-only connectivity from ERP to SAP BTP as your middleware, in this case, share the IP range for your tenant with network/security.
Regards
Hi Kranti,
ECC can use HTTP Proxy to connect with CPI.
Regards,
Priyanka
As Piotr there are outbound protocol for ECC to use, you need know which approach applicable to your scenario. For IDOCs, you can check this. Search for the others wouldn't hurt.
Hi Kranti
Check this SAP Note 2510236 along with SAP blog and help portal links
Regrads
SS
Usually any outbound protocol from ECC can call CPI through HTTPS, you can use SOAP, REST, IDocs. 
Do you mean SAP don't have outbound connection outside of internal network? 
If yes, then you simply can't connect with CPI. 
BR, Piotr
Dear Piotr,
thanks for reply ,
in our scenario ecc should not expose to outer world due to security .
Regards,
kranti.
Dear Priyanka,
Could you plz explain elaborately.

Kranti.

We would like to maintain Profit Centers in Standard Hierarchies nodes.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
Hello,The standard hierarchy is a special type of profit center group that contains all profit centers belonging to a controlling area and that reflects the organizational structure in Profit Center Accounting.
You can create the standard hierarchy in the Manage Your Solution app (or CBC) under Configure Your Solution. Select the Finance application area and the Master and Organizational Data sub area, and open the Profit Centers item.
Then, use the Manage Profit Center Groups app to edit the standard hierarchy so that it contains all the profit centers in your controlling area. Please refer to below documentation:Manage Profit Center GroupsFurthermore, there is also the possibility to use below API in order to achieve this business requirement:Profit Center Group and Hierarchy - Create, Update, DeleteI hope this helps!
Hello,We are planning to migrate SAP GRC ABAP system (NW 7.52 SP08) which is running in windows 2012 R2 to new windows 2019 server and we are not going to migrate the database that is MSSQL 2016 and its already in windows 2016 server.Can we install SAP NW 7.52 in new windows server 2019 with same SID & instance no using windows domain installation with an empty DB instance in already existing MSSQL DB host and repoint to original DB instance that is currently running to the new windows ABAP application server during cutover. Before repointing , shutdown source & target systems and copy all exe, profiles , global directory files,etc.The steps are below,Create a DB instance name SAP<SID>DB4 in existing DB host.Install ASCS instance with same instance no .Install PAS with same instance no.Shutdown source and target systems - Copy exe, profiles,global dir files,etcRepoint/change the DB instance to existing DB instance in profiles .Start SAPPerform Post steps.Will the above steps work?Can you please suggest SAP recommended procedures with minimum downtime ?Thanks,Uthamkumar
Hi Uthamkumar
1. For the Application instance server, do you have to check SAP PAM for your SAP version supported by windows 2019 or not? 
2. On existing SID you can add a number of App servers on the SAP GRC ABAP system.
3. For Any SAP installations you have to refer to the SAP installation guide.
4. Could you share your existing SAP GRC ABAP system main and DB instance details? 
Regards
SS
Hi,
I would say that you must follow an SAP Heterogeneous System Copy procedure using the SWPM tool.
You can refer to the guides here: https://support.sap.com/sltoolset .
Regards,
Isaías
Thank you Isaias .
It should be homogeneous system copy right?? since there is no change in OS nor DB. Only Windows OS version is getting changed .
Since the DB is already in existing DB host and there is no need to update DB host Windows version as it is already in higher windows version 2016. In this case , can we install ASCS & PAS in new host with homogeneous system copy and use existing DB without DB installation and providing existing DB schema & SID . ??

Utham
Hello, 
I am having issues with users rights have the "Right to Refresh" in BI Next Generation Launch Pad. 
I've reset "Security Settings" and this error has started presenting itself. have tried to add the user to full control and still this error presents itself. 
please help! 

Because of the way inheritance works for security, you'll need to check a couple of things:
- Security should be set at the folder level, not for specific reports. 
- Make sure that the Refresh right has not be explicitly denied for the Everyone group.  Explicitly denied willl override explicitly granted for a right if it occurs anywhere in the folder or group hierarchies.
-Dell
try with below step

1) Login to the CMC 2) Browse to the report-> Right click on the report and select User Security3) Select the User or Group to which the User belongs in order to provide rights and click on Assign Security4) Add the View On Demand Access Right and click on apply.5) Now the report should refresh successfully.
In case of explicitly providing the rights follow the steps below:
1) Login to the CMC 2) Browse to the report-> Right click on the report and select User Security3) Select the User or Group to which the User belongs in order to provide rights and click on Assign Security4) Go to Advanced tab -> Click on Add/Remove Rights5) From Content select the type of report e.g. Crystal report6) Grant Refresh the Report's data right and click on Apply. 7) Now the report should refresh successfully.

Hi,
We are using AS2 Sender in Cloud Integration with Client Certificate Authorization.
However our B2B sender gets "401 Unauthorized" error
I have uploaded all their certificates into CI AS2 Sender Adapter.
I have provided sap_cloudintegrationcertificate as well.
Please let me know if there's anything else required to resolve this
Best Regards
Hi Raja- Would you have a look at the below SAP notes?

Hi rajashekhar malgi,
The following blog explaines the basic certificate usage, and also there is a nice table and scenario
https://blogs.sap.com/2021/07/28/how-to-..-configure-inbound-as2-with-dynamic-encryption-and-signature-verification-using-partner-directory-on-cloud-integration/
if you are having issues with client certificate authentication, you can refer to the following blog for troubleshooting: https://blogs.sap.com/2021/07/22/how-to-troubleshoot-client-certificate-authentication-for-inbound-communication-to-cloud-integration-using-wireshark/
if you believe the certificate the sender is using is the issue you can also check this blog: https://blogs.sap.com/2021/08/02/how-to-..-validate-server-connectivity-to-sap-cloud-integration-with-client-certificate-authentication-using-openssl-and-curl/
I hope this helps you.
Best regards
What are they using to login? Basic Auth or Cert based auth? Did you configure that accordingly on your tenant? How did you test the interface? It is the sameway you need to provided them the needed authentication details.
Hello TM Community,
we are facing the issue, that a freight unit is not created out of a delivery. 
As a reference we have a system (also S/4HANA Embedded TM 1709) with exactly the same Customizing & Configuration concerning SCM-Basis & Delivery Integration. In this case, everything is working fine.
Meaning the following key configurations:
- Setup SCM Basis Customizing (logical system etc.)
- Setup Delivery Integration (control key for delivery, Integration Customizing including Mapping of logistics integration profile to shipping point/delivery type/ shipping condition)
The Delivery has the right attributes meaning Shipping Point/Delivery Type and Shipping condition. A right integration customizing can be verified by the fact, that the delivery finds the right control key in the TM Status-Tab:

But nevertheless, a freight unit is not created. Furthermore, there's no Dump/Error Message. So no chance to get an insight, why the freight unit is not created.
I'd be very glad about any suggestions/assumptions on that mysterious issue.
Thanks a lot!
Hi all,
i wanted to ask you, if it is possible to get the functionality of opening an Analysis for Office Workbook from the Analysis Tab (Menu Bar), where you also open DataSources.
I wanted to leverage the UI customizer to use the exact button functionality from the File Menu Analysis > Open Workbook > From SAP Netweaver Server.
This functionality must have a Macro or function behind. But unluckily i am not able to open/display the function as in other functions of the UI customizer. (e.g. something like "Open_Workbook" - but the exact function is yet unknown to me).
I would be happy to receive some help or where i can find some specifics in the code (xml) of Analysis for Office, where these functions are realized.
Ok i went so far to even search in the DLL files of the plugin for that specific opening function.
But somehow still no success until now.

Now i wanted to look, if I can trick the XML of the Menu somehow.
Custom UI profiles are stored in: %APPDATA%/Roaming/SAP/Cof/User Interface
So i tried to copy the function from the File-Menu Button "Open a Workbook" to another Button in the Menu.
This is the function i identified from the FILE MENU Button (nested Button - see MenuGroup 3)
But the Button does not work afterwards. 
I checked that I put it to the same Button category as the xml is validated afterwards. 
But until now no success somehow.
Hi , were you able to achieve this? I would like to achieve the same(open workbook pop up) through a custom button in the ribbon  and not sure which macro is associated with this? 
Thanks in advance.
Regards,Harsha

We used 21 different movement types in our S4C system last year. When using the native inventory reports, these movement types are critical. Next to each movement type # is a 3-5 word phrase attempting to describe the movement type. However, in looking at some of the short descriptions I'm still left wondering exactly when or in what scenario each type could be used.
Has anyone seen a document that expounds upon the goods movement types? 3-5 word descriptions are one thing, but 3-5 sentences would be better, especially for anyone who doesn't regularly process inventory transactions but is needing to generate inventory reports.
Thanks.

Hello Ralph Abraham,
I didn´t came across a document like the one you are looking for, but I will like to give a try from what I have at hand.
Firstly, you can group the Movement Types by classification.
Common examples:

On the SAP Help Portal, you can find a Feature Comparison for Goods Movement, this list will give you insights on the information you are looking for (for example if you want to perform a Goods Receipt for a Purchase Order, you can use 101, 103, 105, 543 or 545):
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/32da8359c8ee4e8b8e8c5e15cacba5aa/de29287f0c0840caacbbc6f79c8d6242.html?locale=en-US

I also would like to suggest to give a look at this extended list of Movement Types:
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/0f69f8fb28ac4bf48d2b57b9637e81fa/8b7b5fe73ef54063a2bfcfbe83cebd38.html?locale=en-US
The description of the Movement Type is almost "self-explanatory", but the "when" to use it came by experience, scenario, industry, etc... Please if you need any particular information about any of your 21 Movement Types, let us know and me or other member of the community will try to help you.
I hope this can help you a little bit, and perhaps someone came across with a detailed document! :)
Best regards,
Gabriel

Hi All,
I want to poll multiple file names from different folders using SFTP adapter. I saw several blogs talking about Poll Enrich and Loop steps but I am not clear how to achieve this? Is there any easy way?
Hi Abraham,
For different folders, check the below link.

Hi
I have scenario with an STO for which an info record exists, but I don't need the info record. I remove the info record from the PO line item and untick the InfoUpdate box. Now I need the standard price to be defaulted from material master. How can this be done. PBXS to be defaulted in PO instead of manual entry for price

Hello,
Do you want to this only for this single PO or for all future PO's? 
If only for this one, why you just can't update Gross Price manually with correct price?
Regards,
Patryk
Hi
The client wants the price to be defaulted from the supplying plant standard price. They do not want to enter it manually
The client needs to know how to fix this in mass for many purchase orders and why the problem occurred in the first place. The standard cost price were always defaulted from the supplying plant. In stead of fixing it manually one by one PO, they need mass change on many purchase orders

Is there a way that you can trigger an incomplete error if a validity date at the item level of an export document is in the past? We have implemented BTI functionality in SAP GTS and this allows us store BTI details that will be copied into an export document when that material is used. We are now seeing issues where some BTI details the valid to date is in the past and this is not checked in the document and hence we are sending to customs references of old BTI details. 
I am aware that we can delete the BTI references against the product master but would like an additional check in the customs document that shows the user the error. 
Thanks

Hello, dear comunity,
In a Workflow BO2080 I have made the following steps: 1. change the status of a service; 2. look for someone who approves the request; 3. If there is someone who approves, then an email is sent to the first person. In this scenario, the email is sent to an adress stored in a single value variable. However, when the Workflow is runt, the email is sent twice to the same address. 
I will really appreciate if someone can help me with this situation. 
Hi all,
we are managing a migration from Nakisa Lease Administrator to SAP RE-FX on S4H. We are now trying to understand how to manage on SAP the lease amount that generate posting but do not impact on the ROU Asset. 
On Nakisa side we have a sort of condition type called "No lease amount" that is a standard sistem conditions for those amounts like payments for services, maintenance or any kind of fee. This condition allow the amounts to be posted monthly but with no impact con the ROU.
On SAP RE-FX side we are not sure if there are any standard condition type to manage this situation. As standard condition for the lease we are using "Credit side basic rent" with purpose "actual rent" or "one time actual rent" when needed. But in case of no lease amount, which standar condition should we use?Thanks in advance.

Hi,
How can we set up several vendors in connection to customer in WEL1, when using Plants abroad? 
For the same sending company we have several vendor numbers, for the different plants we have abroad and I can't find out how to set this up in WEL1. 
 Best Regards
 Ann-Sofie
Ann-Sofie Svensson
In WEL1, you can create a master vendor record with the sending company's details and then create separate vendor records for each of the plants abroad. The master vendor record should be attached to the customer record and the individual plant vendor records should be attached to the master vendor record. This will create a hierarchical structure to connect the customer to the different vendor records.
I have read multiple blogs like [ https://blogs.sap.com/2019/09/03/abap-openapi-ui-v1-released/comment-page-1 , https://github.com/oasis-tcs/odata-openapi ] those are addressing the solutions for the same, but I am unable to follow them. 
I have create a ODATA service that gives Flight details (My inputs are Carrid and Connid). Now I want to generate an Open API for this service.
As, I am very naïve to this API world .Can someone please help me how to create an Open API from ODATA v2?

Hello Abhishek Aggarwal,try this: ABAP OpenAPI UIBest regards,Julian
Hi  Abhishek Aggarwal,
You could install abapGIT temporarily in a local program by copy-pasting the compiled version of abapGIT, which can be found here. (create a program in your development environment starting with $, so it becomes a local program and doesn't need a transport request)
Next step would be to download the git repository as a ZIP file as shown in next screenshot:

Next you create an offline GIT repo in abapGIT as described here and import the zip file you downloaded from the repo in the previous step. (create a Z-package not a $ package, so this can be transported)
Once imported successfully, you can delete the temporary abapGIT program and can start using the ABAP OpenAPI UI.
Best regards,

Hello, I don't work on Successfactors but work as a consumer of data from Successfactors. Our client doesn't have an IT team to support this application, so trying to get an answer here.
We use odata api of successfactors to fetch many fields and one of the fields we look for is Vendor Name that comes from WorkOrder portlet. Its working fine when I hit the rest api for a person whose hiredate is in past. But, if I try to hirt WorkOrder portlet for any future hire person, it returns empty. 
From my HR team, I learnt that the WorkOrder portlet is effective dated. We tried passing the joining date in filter criteria but that didn't work either. So, could anyone let us know on how we can fetch the portlet details for future dated hires.
URL that works for past hires
/odata/v2/WorkOrder?$format=json&$filter=userSysId+eq+'1234'
Hello,
Use the property: toDate, it will return all effective records betwwen today and the toDate date, examples:
/odata/v2/WorkOrder?$format=json&$filter=userSysId+eq+'1234'&toDate=2023-03-16

Hi All,
I am new to SAP Crystal reports. I am using SAP Crystal Reports 2020. 
My requirement is I am trying to build a report where I can set 2 parameter fields one is Date Range Parameter and another a String Parameter and I want to cover the below scenarios. I have created a view and using that same in Crystal Report.

both the parameters should be non mandatory to run the report. 
if a User selects only Date Range parameter and leave the String parameter as blank the report should be filtered based on Date Range Parameter 
if user leave the Date Range Parameter as blank and selects the String Parameter value then the report should be based on the selected String Parameter value 
if user leaves both the filters as blank the entire data should be displayed 
if both parameters were used then based on the selected parameter value the report should be displayed.

Regards,
Deep
Newer versions of Crystal (2011 and newer) have a way to specify a parameter as optional in the parameter definition.  You then handle optional parameters like this in the Select Expert:
Two things to note here:
1.  You must use two separate date parameters instead of a data range parameter in order to get this to work
2.  The parentheses in the above formula are required for getting it to evaluate properly because of the "or" statements.

Hello! I hope someone can help advise how to revise an item (online training with SCORM 2004 4Ed) that's part of a curriculum, while not forcing those who've already completed the item while in the Curriculum to resit the course under the new version. 
I've tried at length to get substitutes to do this, using one version as a substitute for the other, but I cannot get it to have the desired effect and leave the users with just one credit / record on their learning history - I do not want it to look like a user has sat both versions (two rows on the reporting) when they haven't. I just want to say if a user has completed version 1 then they shouldn’t see version 2 on their plan – I don't need them to repeat the item even if version 2 is now on the curriculum. A completion of either version should satisfy the Curriculum requirement - I want version equivalency. 
Simply swapping out 2004 4Ed content without reversioning loses all the SCORM exam detail data in reporting so a simple content replacement as alternative is a non-starter. I’ve tried the online guides for both revising an item and substitutes but neither seems to cover this scenario which I’d have thought is pretty common. If anyone out there has managed this successfully I’d be extremely grateful for your advice!


how to request lms backup
Karl, to my knowledge, there is no back, but you can refresh your desired tenant to another tenant. Typically, a production tenant can be refreshed to your test (or preview) tenant. Once the refresh is done, you will lose all data in your destination tenant. You can find more details here: 2791468 - Instance Refresh Tool for BizX & LMS | Must-know guide & FAQ - SAP ONE Support Launchpad

Hi All,
Is there a standard SAC report showing inactive users in say the last 6 months?
Regards,
Cleo
Cleo James
yes, there is such a standard report:

detailed information on users in a separate tab:

Hi Cleo James , 
You can check out the Administration Cockpit which has information regarding role, KPIs like users that have not logged-on in the past 6 months, team assignments, and much more. 
Please refer to the community post SAP Analytics Cloud – Administration Cockpit | SAP Blogs and help article Use the Administration Cockpit - SAP Help Portal for more information. 
Hope this helps you get the information you need. 
Thank you, 
Manik Mahajan 
yes, this shows user information for active users.....how can I get inactive users. 
The model SAP__SAC_USAGE_ACTIVITIES and SAP__SAC_USAGE_USERS are linked here. filter on activity = login, read and so on....but that's counting or describing active users who have done something in SAC. How do we find users who have been inactive?
The link of models is Link type = 
1. primary data . SAP__SAC_USAGE_ACTIVITIES users
2. All data SAP__SAC_USAGE_ACTIVITIES and SAP__SAC_USAGE_USERS users.....that's all users so , SAP__SAC_USAGE_USERS users.
3. only intersecting data : i.e. SAP__SAC_USAGE_ACTIVITIES.
How do we get (A Intersection B) inverse? or
 (SAP__SAC_USAGE_USERS ) minus (SAP__SAC_USAGE_ACTIVITIES)?
and in that result set we seek not only count of inactive users but their IDs and names.
Hi Cleo James,
You can get the information about the inactive users in the Administration cockpit.
Go to Files -> System -> Common -> SAC Content -> Administration cockpit. 
Run Analytic Application. Under Authorization tab, click on Inactive users.
Here you can define desired time frame as per your choice.

Hello,
In the Admin Cockpit you will het the information about the Inactive users.

wda.pngHello Team,
The NWBC transaction is exposed as Fiori App and attached are the buttons which are available in Webdynpro. When it is exposed in Fiori with Standard Fiori Theme "Save" & "Close" is displayed in Bottom Right Corner and other buttons are visible in Left Top Corner. Can we re-align the Button Positions??
Thanks & Regards,
Salman
Hi Salman,
could you please post your question directly to the Fiori community? That would be great! We (SAP Business Client) are just a shell. And even if that shell is a very clever one - combining several UI technologies, managing navigation, running on BTP within the SAP Fiori Launchpad Service, ...... - we cannot move or add buttons on application side. 
SAP Fiori is a design language. But there are many ways to adapt the UI.

Hi IDM experts,
I have to connect IDM to a MS SQL Database, using the equivalent of "Windows authentication".
IDM is installed on a unix server. I think I got the overview of what to do, but i'm stuck. I added integratedsecurity=true to my db connexion string. I get the following error : This driver is not configured for integrated authentication.
Is is quite similar to what Matt had here : https://answers.sap.com/questions/11198836/sqljdbcauthdll-reference-in-a-dispatcher.html
First of all, I downloaded again my jdbc driver from microsoft website. I found the file to rename in the zip and put it in my java jre/bin folder. Is it the right place to put it? I guessed that since this java folder is in my dispatcher properties it should find it. I then restarted my dispatcher but no success.
So two questions : where should i put this sqljdbc_auth.dll and how should i declare it to be found?
Then, I think I'll probably be stuck again : should i also create a different dispatcher, ran by the windows user that should connect to the DB or is it another way to do it? Also, DB string connexions in IDM require a user and a passord, if i put in something wrong, will it be ignored? Or should i go through a script?
Thank you!
Clotilde
Clotilde, I've never done myself what you're trying to achieve, but Alex' comment regarding the DLL is definitely correct: you can't use this on Linux. So I'm pretty sure putting the DLL into whatever directory won't solve your problem. Microsoft might not even ship any Linux version (ending in .so) of this shared library - at least I didn't found any mention of sqljdbc_auth.so anywhere.
This StackOverflow answer mentions that you need to have a different configuration on the SQL client/JDBC driver side to make integrated security work on Linux by using a different security mechanism (Java/Kerberos). You may want to try that suggestion out.
Hi Clotilde,
sorry but I cannot provide insights with MSSQL as DB.
But I am using a custom jar with my dispatchers and I put it in the Identity_Center/Java directory from IDM runtime. There you can find other DLLs like sapjco3.dll as well.
For my custom jar I add it to dispatcher definition "DSE Class Path" in the Dispatcher Gui menue "Settings". I would guess that the DLL will get loaded automatically once it is in the right place.
From reading your post I have one question: Is your dispatcher instance on Windows? If it is on Unix as well I would assume that a DLL is not helpful! IMHO you would need a unix library as a pendant, most commonly ending on .so.
Reading the linked post I would recommend checking the link to MS page http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms378428.aspx. There should be an option to enable integrated authentication like Matt did with "mxmc_db;integratedSecurity=true;" as database parameter in the dispatcher settings of IDM 7.2.

Alex

As mentioned by Jorge Bastos above we have solved using the BAS by removing the below parameter  "sap-value-list": "none"
hi Vijay,
It works if you expose value help entity in service definition explicitly.

Any solution for this.

Hi Rajesh , Vijay,
you have to sync metadata from BAS to reflect this addition in service definition.

There are 2 points regarding value help in ODataV2.
Best wishes,
Ramjee Korada
Hello Vijay,You can achieve this by defining the appropriate value help for the relevant elements of the CDS abstract entity using the CDS annotation @Consumption.valueHelpDefinition for the parameter. This can be done either directly in the CDS data definition of the abstract entity or separately using a CDS metadata extension. 
Here is an example:


Hope this helps.

We've bought Crystal Server 2013. Is it free to use any version of Crystal Report Runtime (for .NET Framework) within our organization?
  The runtime is downloaded from https://www.tektutorialshub.com/crystal-reports/how-to-download-and-in  stall-crystal-report-runtime/  
Hello,
Crystal Server 2013 is end of life, no more patches or security updates, you can see it here:
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/SAP+Crystal+Products+-+End+of+Mainstream+Maintenance+Dates
If you purchased it from a third party I suggest returning it for a refund and go to SAP site and get it, link below.
Please don't use third party download sites for Runtime, Product teams don't know how many are downloading the products, even though it's free. Using Third party sites doesn't show our Product teams how many are actually using the product which can impact supportability.
And all they are doing is redirecting to our download page anyways.
For CR for VS go to my WIKI: Download link is there also.
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/Crystal+Reports%2C+Developer+for+Visual+Studio+Downloads
Next issue is CR for VS will not connect to CR Server, it does not include the 2 dll's required, we stopped shipping them after CR 2008.
To get the latest supported version of CR Server go here: (note you can change the country to your locale)
https://www.sap.com/canada/products/technology-platform/crystal-server.html
To get the .NET runtime capable of connecting to CRS you can use the Installer, select Custom and choose the .NET SDK, should be both 32 and 64 bit.
The 2 assemblies are Framework and Infostore that you need to connect to the CRS Server
Or if you purchased CR Server from SAP you will get a 1 year Support Contract or more if desired and have access to our Support portal and downloads, you can download the MSI packages separately.
Here's the link: https://support.sap.com/en/index.html
If you have SDK questions you can get a SAP Support Engineer to assist also.
Don
If you'd like some sample code for using the Crystal Server SDK, see my website: http://dellstinnett.com/sample_code.html. Most of the code there is for SAP BusinessObjects. Since Crystal Server is just a subset of the SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform, the samples will work with Crystal Server. Also, the code there is older, but none of the updates to the SDK will change how that code works - you just have to update the assemblies that are being referenced.

We would also like to manage employee's emergency contact data directly through the people profile. Is this possible?
Thank you

Hi all.
I need a report that brings to me the consignment material stocks by customer, the MMBE t-code shows that information, but to see the customer code I need to enter in the consignment stock one by one, I want a report that shows in each line: material; batch; customer code; customer name; stock count.
Is there that report by standard? What is it?
Thanks best regards.
Dear Marcelo, 
Please refer to transactions MB52.
Special stock = "W"
Display batch stocks = "marked"
Everything will be there.
Hello Marcelo Rodrigues de Jesus,
Please check MB52 to see Consignment stock with customer. Select special stock indicator "W" with display option "Non Hierarchical Representation.
Let me know if any question on it.

Hi SAP/Alexander Bundschuh ,
We are using CIC with PO runtime. In one the interface ,http receiver client certificate authentication should be used.
Please let me know if client certificate authentication is supported or not.
We have loaded the private key in igw_default_keystore in NWA ,but while testing ,we could see only "401" unauthorized error.
Same certificate/key works fine with POSTMAN.
Please let me know where to import the certificate and Keys in NWA.
What would be the Private key alias name in channel configuration.

Hi,
I am trying to set up SAC Embedded Edition by following the set up activities mentioned in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icy1m2yaLsw
I seem to have hit a roadblock at the final step in accessing sac_embedded_edition_service endpoint.

It seems like the DataWarehouse Cloud standard functionality for Currency Conversion cannot be setup for a S/4HANA Public connection. There is only a Manual option as source. But that is a dead-end street, because the TCUR* tables cannot be replicated to DWC (as tables). 

As an alternative I had to compose something with CDS-views (provided they are released) and had to create own views in combination with calculated colums. A cumbersome approach while the in-built functionality is sitting there idle.
This seems strange, because the built-in currency conversion is a powerful feature. What am I overlooking here? How can the standard conversion be setup for S/4HANA Public?
Hi, In SAP when ai fill a equipament number, in IW21 for exemple, it fills the functional location automatically, it works perfect, but I would like to know if is possible, by standard configuration, I do the inverse: when I give the funcitional location the SAP automatically fills the equipmament number. Is it possible? If yes, how can I set up that?
Thanks best regards.
Hello https://people.sap.com/mrrjesus,
The equipment is installed on the functional location that's why system pick up automatically functional location in IW21. If there are multiple equipments installed on a functional location then how system knows which equipment to be picked so it's not feasible.
Regards,
Neeraj Jain 
Neeraj's answer is correct. This is not possible and should not be feasible. 
If you have plenty of functional locations with only ONE equipment and you're not using IS-U, then you might have either flocs or equipment records which are not necessary.

Hi All,
As mentioned in Blog Cloud Integration – Remote OData API’s for Integration Flows I am trying to perform multiple Parameter Update via Batch mode.
While doing so the message is getting failed with the below error in CPI.

However, when I checked the Iflow parameters the values are getting updated in the configurable parameters of the Iflow objects. So, I am suspecting the issue is occurring while parsing the response from the ODATA adapter.
In order to do this, I have created an Iflow in SCPI with ODATA adapter as the receiver.

Hi,
I am trying to create a WordCloud in SAP Analytics Cloud using R Visualizations. I have used the following demo script below which works great using the mentioned BestRun_Demo model, or modifying it to work with any other models we have in our environment.
In some of our models we have data using Swedish letters (å, å and ö) and those come out with two dots in a word cloud. They are ok in any other chart visualizations but not in R visualizations. I assume I need some kind of Encoding() in the script, but the question is what is the formula for this to work with SAP Analytics Cloud and where in the script should it be placed?

# load package library(wordcloud)
# get words words <- BestRun_Demo$Product
# get frequency frequency <- BestRun_Demo$'Quantity sold'
# generate word cloud wordcloud(words, frequency, scale = c(3, 1), rot.per=0.2, colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"))
Hello Ulf - I guessing that another R package may be needed - I haven't tried R with SAP Analytics Cloud, but found a related post here: 
https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/200729638-Knitr-can-t-see-swedish-characters-in-pdf 
I don't know if another R library can be referenced?
Hi,
before loading the libraries, you must set:
e.g.
Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", "cs_CZ.utf8")
options (encoding="UTF-8")
library(....)
Hello everyone,
maybe I remmember wrong, but I though that to set system preferences you have to have high rights. I put these two lines of code to R lang visualization and result is some kind of warning.
I had to figure out something similar and I find this few lines of code, maybe it also helps. Be aware of UTF-8 need to have dash in it. But to set up some kind of huge chart could be difficult. 
And there is the result. Result is printed with htmltools library and browsable function.

Hi Community
How can we affect a symbolic account to a company code
Because , i have tow company that use the same chart of accounts, and they use for the same Wage Type two different accout.
I have noticed that when I have a key figure with base level WKPRODLOC and aggregate to Months, the current month is not editable after the 1st of the month. There is an SAP Note which states that this is standard behavior and it seems earlier versions allowed this. However, I believe it is quite common for Demand Planners to make monthly adjustments and current client does not want to work in weeks. I don't want to change the base level of all the key figures as they might choose to do weekly planning in the future. Is there any way around this.
Sorry the title is incorrect. I meant to say the current MONTH is not editable.

Hi all,they asked me to develop a small program that allows printing on a continuous roll Zebra printer.I have always prepared Crystal Reports with a page setup.Never for continuous rolls.In practice they have to print customer lists and not knowing how many there are, a continuous roll is needed.As if it were a shop receipt practically.Can you tell me how to proceed? Any suggestions?I develop this with VS2019 and c#.Thanks for support A.
Hi Andy,
Added the CR for VS tag...
You can get the updates from my WIKI here:
SP 33 is the latest, we only support the latest since it's a full install and no patches.
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/Crystal+Reports%2C+Developer+for+Visual+Studio+Downloads
Use the CR for VS install for VS 2019 and below on your DEV PC and use the MSI redist packages to deploy the runtime, you can't manually deploy the runtime.
Zebra printer paper is continuous so that is not a problem.
When designing the report select the Zebra printer using Page Setup in CR Designer.
Now when printing you would select multiple labels through the Record Selection Formula.
When printing it will will simply print those records.
See the Printer test app I wrote on the WIKI page above:
Note the Zebra printer is shown as the saved printer, so the SDK will look for that printer.
Note: if using a custom paper size simply add that paper size using the same name on every printer and the SDK will find it and use it by default.

Hi Gurus,
We are migrating Data from SAP ECC to S/4 HANA Cloud through Migration Cockpit . I need to load Work Order Data but there is no Work Order Data Object or Migration Program in Migration Cockpit Tool.
I need to load the Corrective Work Orders , Please advise the alternative options to load the Work Orders. Thanks in advance.
Hi, 

I assume that you refer to best practices business process "Corrective Maintenance (BH1)"

https://rapid.sap.com/bp/#/browse/categories/sap_s%254hana/areas/cloud/packageversions/BP_CLD_ENTPR/S4CLD/1908/US/17/EN/scopeitems/BH1

At the moment, there is no migration object for the maintenance order provided so that the migration cockpit cannot be used to migrate those maintenance orders.

Instead, I would like to highlight another approach that you might want to consider. Please review SAP Note 2447593 https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2447593/E

Hi,
what do you mean when you are saying, you want to migrate "Work order"?  Term Work order is used in different areas for different kind of business objects. It is used for the following areas IS-U, PP, Service on Demand, SCM. Do you mean the work order of some of that area? Sometimes people use the term work order and mean the business object Maintenance order  of the area PM (plant maintenace).

I'm testing Data migration in S4Hana Public cloud using XML file. I updated the file with resource name but during mapping the system is asking to map the resource name with Target value but there were no any values exist in the target system (screen shot attached). 
If I enter any values manually it is not accepting (screen shot attached) and leaving it blank is also leading to error at the time of simulation(screen shot attached). This field is not a mandatory one but still the system is not allowing to go forward.
Could someone advise how to handle this Error??
Hi Suresh Eswaran,
In the Workcenter_Resource data migration template, you have filled the column 'Name of the Pooled Capacity'. It is not the Description/Name of the Work center capacity.

 Pooled capacities needs to be created individually before assigning it to Resource/Work Center. A pooled capacity can be assigned to several work centers. It is created and edited independently of the work center. You can create it using tcode CR11 and then assign the same in work center if required. Once it is created, you can view the same in list of capacities

If you don't want to assign pooled capacity, no need to enter the value in the template and leave it blank.
For more details on Data Migration, please refer SAP Help Portal
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/d5699934e7004d048c4801b552f3b013/17632822a8fb4c368d2ec57564dc383a.html?q=migration%20cockpit%20for%20workcenter

Hi,

 This is definitely due to configuration issues...Can you try extending to other plant other than '000' and check whether the same error? if not i suppose it has to do with specific value '000' if its not maintained in T436A...if its maintained check whethere you are giving proper values to BAPI..

Hello,
I'm facing an issue related to the After-Loading event that I cannot properly trigger.
I have a Custom BO with Root and two Subnodes.
I created a QA view where I positioned two advanced list panes binded to SubnodeA and SubnodeB respectively
I planned to use the After-Loading event to determine a transient flag into every node.
Whenever the QA screen is opened, SubnodeA and Root's After-Loading events are triggered and operate as planned, but this never happens for SubnodeB.
The documentation states that to trigger an After-Loading the entire node should be instanced, but I don't fully understand how to do so.
"You can implement this event to modify transient fields of the current node of a business object. The system executes the AfterLoading event when it reads a node instance of a business object from the data base."
I didn't do anything different for SubnodeA and B, all their fields are binded into the List Panes, so the After-Loading should be triggered in the exact same way.
I found this note
https://apps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/2637194
where it states that "only if the whole instance of the Node is loaded, the event will be triggered"
I placed all of the fields of SubnodeB into the List Pane, so in theory the whole instance should have been loaded, but it still doesn't fire the After-Loading event.
What is the correct way to make sure a node instance is read so that the event triggers?
Thank you.
Interesting to come here almost 3 years later...I gave up entirely in using the after loading event and used something completely different.
Hi guys,
We use CR2013 in our company and most users complain that their label printers (Zebra or Toshiba) are missing when trying to print a label. The only solution is to remove the printer and add it again! this will works for sometimes until printers disappear again!!
has anyone else seen this behavior?
May be time to upgrade to CR 2016 or the latest CR 2020 (64bit).
CR 2013 doesn't know what Windows 10 is so it's likely an issue with Windows that CR 2013 isn't aware of.
Link to download CR 2016(32 bit) or CR 2020.
https://www.sap.com/canada/products/technology-platform/crystal-reports.html
Crystal Reports scans the PC's Windows Printer registry keys for the installed printers and DEVMODE structure..
If they are missing it's an issue in Windows itself or your account or resources or permissions.
When installing Printers you must install them under a local Admin account and when asked to select the option to allow all users to have access.
Try right clicking on CR Designers Icon and select Run As Administrator and see if that helps also.
When the printer disappears open NotePad or Word and check if the printer is available from there also.
Hi Don,
Thanks for your reply,
We always install the printer drivers of the label printers for the first time with the domain Admin account for our users and then users can remove and re-add the printer iff needed with the Amin credential.
When the label printer disappears in CR, we can still access it from the control panel. But I think it's a good idea to check if we can see the printer in notepad or not.
Shahin
Great, just be aware CR 2020 is 64 bit so your DB Client/Connection must also be 64 bit....
I don't believe Printers drivers will have platform issues since Windows manages printing and CR simply passes the output to the Print Spooler...

Hello,
Not clear what you are asking but if you are referring to 6.0 Framework, CR for VS doesn't support it and never will.
Set your project Framework to 4.7 or 4.8.
You can read all about it on my WIKI:
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/Crystal+Reports%2C+Developer+for+Visual+Studio+Downloads
To integrate into Visual Studio you need to run the EXE, the one for VS 2022.
DO NOT install just the MSI runtime packages as Yogananda Muthaiah suggested on your Development PC, and the link he posted doesn't work, it doesn't integrate into VS, no Project Templates or the embedded Report Designer is installed. Redist packages are for deployment only.
You want to install this one: CR for Visual Studio SP33 64b installer (VS 2022 and above)
Here's a link to a blog I wrote to upgrade old projects to the latest SP, lots of into in it you need to follow as well:

To add Crystal Reports to your .NET 6 project in Visual Studio 2022 (Community), you will need to install the Crystal Reports for Visual Studio 2022 redistributable package. The redistributable package is available from the SAP Crystal Reports developer website:https://crystalreports.sap.com/crystalreports/en/downloads.htmlOnce the redistributable is installed, you should be able to add a Crystal Reports item to your project. To do this, right-click the project in Solution Explorer and select Add > New Item. When the Add New Item window appears, select Crystal Reports from the list of available templates. From there, you will be able to create a new report.Hope this helps.
Hi, I'm kind of new in all this stuff and I'm looking for help. 
The thing is that in the PO, doing GR/IR, there's only one invoice receipt, but when I search in VIM analytics I can see another invoice posted in the same PO. 
May I ask for a reversal of the GR, as it seems that they receive all the goods, or clarify why the invoice is not reflected when I'm doing GR/IR.
Thanks!.
Hello Isis Domínguez,
Please check table - EKBE for particular PO to reconcile/check documents. If not found anything, then please share related screen shots PO History tab etc. to understand the issue.

Hi SAP Experts,
I have a list of material batch numbers. I would like to find the original purchasing documents for these batches if possible. Is there a transaction where you can enter a material batch number and find the purchasing document used to originally buy the raw material?
Thanks,
Noah
Hello https://people.sap.com/nmun,
If you have entered batch number in PO then check transaction ME2M, ME2L and ME2N etc.
If not then you can put your batch number in MB51 transaction to get details of your purchasing documents. Run the report with option "Flat List" and change your layout as per your desired requirements.

Hi everyone
I am trying to assign a consignment material to a PM Work Order but it doesn't pick up the price in material master. "Price cannot be determined for material". How can i get this fixed? I need a cost to be calculated as planned cost and trigger a PR.
Thank you
Dear Members,
I have a subcontracting material with F 30 setup. The material has a BOM with a component which is in-house produced and activated with advanced planning. while creating subcontracting purchase requisitions for the header material, no planned orders are generated for the component. all the master data settings for the component are available in PPDS. Kindly let us know the process to plan components within a subcontracting material with PPDS.
Thanks and Regards
I have a customer who is trying to download attachments from a sourcing event but they always get errors when downloading. They are wondering if there are issues with the download process if the sourcing supplier loads zip files and Ariba downloads those supplier zip files into a consolidated zip file? Has anyone heard of that before or found a workaround?
We followed the steps documented in Connect for downloading but it does not reference any issues with downloading a zip file into another zip file.
Any help is appreciated.
Hi Scott, if only one Supplier participant is experiencing an issue with exporting ALL attachments as a ZIP file, they may try the following: 
OR: 
Hopefully this will work for them. 
Good luck!
Thank you for the response but my question was more around when a customer receives responses to their sourcing events from suppliers and they want to download all of them. Is there an issue with a zip file being inside of a zip file when downloading?
The customer keeps having system issues (lag, crash, etc.) and are trying to identify if it is how a supplier is responding or if they should try something else. Thanks!
Hi All,

We are in the process of Upgrade from 4.6C to ECC 5.0. As a part of Unit testing I have created a Cost Center using TC KS01. When immediately I try to delete the same Cost Center using KS04 I am not allowed to delete. The message I get is <b>

Deletion not possible (usage is in table T811C)
Message no. KS266</b>.

Diagnosis
Cost center C002/0000001488 cannot be deleted because it is still being used in table T811C.

System response
The following tables are checked during deletion:

Cycles:
T811C: Cycles in Overhead Cost Controlling or Profitability Analysis
CATS data that has not yet been transferred to CO:
CATSCO: CATS transfer CO
CATSPS: CATS transfer PS
CATSPM: CATS transfer PM
CATSMM: CATS transfer MM
COIFT: Interface for activity allocation.
PTEX2000: Interface table for IT attendance/absence (2002/2001)
PTEX2010: Interface table for infotype employee remuneration information (2010)
Settlement rules:
COBRB: Distribution rules, settlement rule, order settlement
Orders:
AUFK: Order master data
Projects that are indicated as account assignment elements:
PRPS: WBS element (work breakdown structure element) master data
Assets to which postings can be made:
ANLZ: Asset assignments with validity date
In the standard system, this message is issued as an error message.

In Customizing, you can deactivate this message. See the implementation guide (IMG) for "General Controlling" under the following activity: "Change Message Control" (work area "KS", message number "266").

Procedure
You can display all of these uses by choosing the ENVIRONMENT menu in Cost Center Master.


Could you please let me know how do I delete the cost center?

Thanks and Regards.
Prasad
This is a program error. Go by OSS note 731762. Also since you are in the upgrade mode, you should have the latest support package uploaded.
It has allocation cycles associated with it. You can also change the message control by following menu path
SPRO-Controlling-Change Message Contro and select application area KS. change the message control from warning to information this should fix it.
Assign points if helpful
Hi, 

If the Cost center is having any postings then the system will not allow you to delete, but in your case i suppose there are no postings, but linked in the Master data as per your listings. Please get into all Cycles and remove the Cost Center, also the WBS - Project master, Internal Order , asset master and Distribution/settlement rule. 

Once you have all these removed and then check the Where-used list in the Cost center master. Also please block it against any posting. If any posting is there in the Cost center you need to wait untill the next year for deleting. System will allow you to delete the same starting from next year. 

Regards
Nambi
Hi,
Use T.Code: OBMSG

Application Area: KS
Message No.: 266
Change it from error to warning.
Save and come out

Now try to delete the cost centre. The system will allow.

Hope this helps, if yes, please assign points.
Regards,
Harish
Hi,
Go to environment and check the where used lists and check whether this cost centre is used in any of the list. For example, if that cost center is used in actual assessment, then we cannot delete it.
So change the actual assessment cycle.
Similarly that cost centre must not appear in CO PA,activity cycles,etc.
After theses changes the cost center can be deleted.
The point is that before deleting, it must not be linked to any of the lists in the where used list in environment.
After changing the related cycles, the cost center must be deleted.
Please confirm whether this is useful.

Hi, SAP World:
I have a integration in IC for Req data. I work for a very large company that has a lot of data. In one of the filters I have Candidate Progress is not equal to "Default" from my understanding is that it removes blank candidate statuses (please correct me if I'm wrong). Well, with the filter we're missing some reqs on our feed (which makes sense) but they want to see all reqs. I removed the filter and now the integration is failing saying "Error - Expanded Size 16,278 exceeds the limit of 10,000". I've tried searching KBA's for this issue and have come up unsucessful. The integration is running every 24hrs and I even changed it to every 12 hrs, and it failed. Any thoughts or assistance would be apprecaited. 
Hello,HR integration is not active in the system, and we create Business users with the app Maintain Employee F2288A.Roles SAP_BR_MANAGER and SAP_BR_PURCHASING_MANAGER assigned to the user.As specified in SAP note 3287415 - Users not available in Manage Workflow for Purchase Requisitions. 3279729 - No users available in People picker of Manage workflow application. When maintaining Workflow for Purchase Requisition with Manage Workflow app F2190, I use Recepient assignment by User, and the user is mssing in the People picker T_F2288A.If I enter it manually, sustem says that this user ID is not valid.Employees with HR master data are in the list. Does that mean that for using Flexible Workflow in Purchasing, integration with HR is a must?------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
Yes - you are correct, users must have a HR user assigned to them to be available for Workflow; 
At the system level, for Workflow to "work", the dimensions of people plus time / scheduling is directly linked - creating users via the Maintain Employee App is the correct way, but this (implicitly) adds the constraint that HR users are available for the Workflow.
So, for other types of users (that do not exist as Employees in the system) the Workflow has nothing to trigger "against" in the overall procurement / ERP process.
The KBAs you reference are similarly worded to a slightly older one (which is updated for later releases) 2869055 which I have included here: 
====
To be able to see the users in People Picker (and HR module is active), **users must be defined as Employees and assigned to a Business Partner.**
This means that user data must be available in the following tables: IEMPLOYEE, IUSER, IEMPLOYORGDET and IEMPLOYSTATDET.
====
> from the MM perspective, HR integration *must* be active, and assigned to the BP to function / be linked. 
I hope this clarifies, and thanks for the question!
Hello Experts SII,
I need your help regarding an issue.
We use FICA not only for customer but also for the supplier invoice.
Means not only output tax (for customer) is involved but also input tax (for supplier)
When I run EDOC_ESII transaction, we got following error:

In my supplier invoice, for sure it is an input tax, but SAP considers it always as an outgoing invoice (edocument type ES_SII_OIV)
Do you know if Standard solution SII for FICA handles the supplier invoice in FICA with input tax?
Thanks for your help.

Dear SAP Experts, 
Step 1 : I have planned 12,000 USD for 12 months , Each month 1000 USD , Uploaded active budget control template for the cost centre id : 11004006
Step 2 : Just assume , January month we are not used planned amount 1000 USD , Then System will consider those un used 1000 USD amount in February month as total 2000 USD available .
Step 3 : When we are trying to post purchase order in February Month for the net value > 2000 USD System will throw the error ( Monthly Planned Active Budget Control Result )
 Draw back : If we want to plan and post purchase order for 12 months 12 each * 1000 USD ( Rent ) , Getting error as I have only 2000 USD Budget up to for February month 
Presently Active budget control set up we have monthly wise , Regarding Yearly planned budget .
Thanks and Regards, 
Krishna .
Hello Krishna,
exactly for that example your released budget can exceed the monthly planned budget. 
Quote " "Draw back : If we want to plan and post purchase order for 12 months 12 each * 1000 USD ( Rent ) , Getting error as I have only 2000 USD Budget up to for February month"So you could release in Jan for example the entire 12.000 USD in case you need to order 12x1000,00 USD already in Jan.
Please also have a look at the related blog post where I tried to explain that released budget might require a 'lead time' compared to 'planned budget' that anticipated the actual assurance of costs.Active Budget Control in SAP Business ByDesign – Budget Release | SAP Blogs

Hi SAP Community,I try at the moment to create a custom calculation in SAP CPQ Quote 2.0. unfortunately all tests failed due to the fact that the CartItem context does not recognize the object "Item" what could cause this issue and how to solve this?

 - Every time i try to Verifiy Database or add a class on Database Expert, if the class implements an interface or as inheritance i receive the following error.

Hi Luis,
Here's what R&D suggests:
I tried the VS2022 + SP33 CR4VS64(no
32bit CRRuntime) on a Win11 machine, there’s no such problem…
And I also tried VS2015+ SP18 CR4VS SxS with
VS2022 + SP33 CR4VS64 on Windows Server 2019, it worked well on both VS2015
& VS2022.
I’d suggest:

Hi Luis,
Check your app.config file for the LegacyMode, I don't recall the complete value, if you have it delete that line:
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/Crystal+Reports%2C+Developer+for+Visual+Studio+Downloads
"5. For reports using the ADO.Net DB connection, in previous SP's, you could only work under .Net Framework 2.0/3.5, so using 
 
   in app.config is required. Now in SP21 and above, 
  ADO.Net is only supported on .Net Framework 3.5 or above and you can remove the tag."
 
<startup useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy="true">
Also note VS 2022 is a 64 bit interface so check your projects Platform setting, don't use AnyCPU, use x86 or x64, CR runtime is for your platform and not the OS.
I wrote a blog on upgrading also:
https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/30/upgrading-a-visual-studio-2008-2019-.net-project-with-the-latest-cr-.net-sdk-packages/
Don
Update:
 - Sorted my problem but now i trully believe that there is incompatibility with VS2022.
 - Installed VS2019, and the error disappeared..
Interesting...
When you installed CR for VS 2022 EXE did you also install the 32 bit MSI at the end of the installer?
Did you go through my Blog also and set all Copy Local to false etc.?
Could be a dependency was installed.
If you want to pursue this run Process Monitor and look for anything that seems cross platform.
What happens if you uninstall VS 2019 and repair VS 2022 and CR for VS?

Hello, 
I generated a sales line in negative, another in positive and generated a voucher for the remaining amount. I find that in SAP B1 I generate a sales invoice with 100% discount on the total?! And it does not make me the corresponding accounting note of the amount of the voucher ...
I had tried this situation in previous versions and it worked correctly ... 
Attached capture of the monitor and B1 so you can see that in the sales ticket there was no 100% discount. 


Have you encountered this situation or can you tell me why this happens? 
Thanks in advance!
Dear Rosa Martín,
We have provided a fix in version 4.0.00 of the CCO services for B1if.
See SAP Note 2163033:
Bug fix when DocTotal is 0. We send the UnitPrice of the sales items. Without unit price under special circumstances, the tax is calculated differently in SAP BusinessOne as compared to SAP Customer Checkout.
This fix was provided especially to address the issue you reported. Please import the latest version of the CCO services according to the note 2163033.
Afterwards please check if the same CCO document will create an AR Invoice in Business One according to your expectations.
Kind regards,
Gunther
Hello Rosa,
the 100% discount is automatically created in B1 because the total amount of the receipt is 0.
Can you please add more details of the transaction in the CCO Monitor, especially the payment (posiciones de pago) to be able to analyse this further?
Thank you! 
Hi Arne, 
There are no payment details because the customer should not pay anything. 
The problem is that I do not understand what you have done to me with the amounts of the ticket regarding the invoice. 
Look at the ticket vs the invoice. 


Thank you!
Dear Rosa Martín ,
how did you solve it?
Thanks,
Julian
Dear Julian, 
I still can't find a solution to the problem reported. Any suggestions? 
Thank you. 
Best regards,
Dear Rosa,
I think what you are reporting is a result of a change we have done in a previous version (3.5.80 upwards, see note 2163033) of our CCO packages in B1if. This change was done to improve the postings from CCO to Business One in case the document total is zero.
So what basically happens now in case of a document total of zero is that we do not send the single unit amount for each sales item to DI API anymore. So like in your example we only send the total of all sales items:
-66.14 + 38.74 + 70.40 + 2.24 = 45.24
The amount of 45.24 is sent to the DI API as Total before discount along with a 100% discount in order to balance the receipt total down to zero.
This is done because in the past (before that fix) the AR invoice in Business One had a total of 0.01 even though from CCO a zero total was sent.
Hope this information is helpful for you.
Kind regards,
Gunther
Dear Gunther Sandtner, 
In my humble opinion, I think it is a mistake in this last scenario.
 In this case the transfer of prices in Business One on the lines is not correct, and that makes the amount of the document in SAP incorrect. 
This particular transaction is about a return and two sales. A voucher is generated from the difference (€ 2.24).I attached a new capture to see what really should have transferred to SAP Business One. 

Thank you very much for your help.
Kind regards, 
Rosa Martín
Hello Gunther Sandtner, 
I have already created the issue. I hope to receive news soon. If you give me a solution I will let you know. 
Thanks for the help.
Kind regards, 
Rosa
Hello Rosa,
Did you solve this issue after upgrading the CCO scenario to 4.0.00 on the B1iF ?

Hi Community,
Would you know what is the possible error of the below screenshot?

I can't say I've seen that specific error (and I'm in the middle of a bunch of DA development at the moment). If you see this from the outset (i.e. before it even displays any content) the I would double-check that your Index has been generated, contains content (check the lesson.js file in the File System), and has been published.
If you get this error when trying to display content from the DA panel, check that the content you are trying to display has been published. Due to some particularly Germanic logic, the Index will include ALL content under the DA object, regardless of whether this is published or not - and will therefore be listed in the content panel - but then when a Learner tries to display it, they aren't authorized to display draft content so an error is generated (not the one you show above, but it may be related).
If all of that is good, I would do some troubleshooting:
Failing that, wait until May, when the entire thing is going to be re-vamped (again), anyway! ;-)
Hi
Our system automatically generates Central Persons and Positions like it should, but somehow we now got a user that suddenly has no Central Person or Position.
How can I get the system to generate a new Central Person and Position? I have tried via tcode USERS_GEN and then create from template -> RFC -> ECC system, but I get the error that the user already exists so It wont generate the Central Person and Position for it. 
I'm trying to integrate an external solution with SAP. I have access to a trial SAP account and have installed some of the OData APIs. I can connect to these APIs and use GET and POST/PUT web methods to communicate with SAP. I now have a requirement to use an endpoint that is only available through SOAP.
I'm told that the best route forward would be to consume the BTP OData and SOAP APIs directly and connect BTP to the client instance. This route would provide the ability to connect to both S/4HANA OP and Cloud.
Is there and current documentation available that details how to connect BTP to an instance of an SAP client and is there any documentation that demonstrates how to connect an external application to BTP please?
Hi Juliano,
Thank you for the updated tags the post. I hope someone with suitable experience is now able to find it and provide some directions to documentation.
Many thanks,

Hello,
We have an interface SOAP to RFC scenario and RFC FM has input parameter of type XSTRING (base64binary) to accept attachments.
We have implemented interface in CPI with no mapping as FM's WSDL we used to generate SOAP service.
Now when we call SOAP service from SOAP UI, base64 data is treated as java.lang.string and not base64.
In Monitoring we get error : Error in executing RFC Function, cause :.com.sap.conn.jco.ConversionException: (122) JCO_ERROR_CONVERSION: Cannot convert value "VGVzdA==" from type java.lang.string to type XSTRING at field I_ATTACHMENT.
Thanks
Hi Suraj,
You could always use attachments in a proxy interface by directly attaching the content to the message, and then wrapping the RFC inside the proxy stub.  As for the data in your example... you would need to convert it to a hexstring before calling the RFC for the system to be able to process it without error.

Hi all,
While trying to archive a single info record, in the ME15 screen, only selected "complete info record data" and forgot to set deletion flag on purchase org. data. Then tried to archive using write program and delete program but error occurred and now the info record data is not completely archived. Now the system shows info record '500XX11' is archived and cannot be changed while trying to access the info record.
Can anyone suggest a solution to fully archive this info record...???

Dear Experts,
Our goal is to use the Webservice for Business Partner End-of-Purpose of SAP Hybris Cloud for Customer.
For this we went through the following guide: https://help.sap.com/doc/80f1e2d9e5884c7493c7cdb27a34c8b8/CLOUD/en-US/SetUpGuide.pdf
In our project scope we checked the question „Do you want to check and maintain end of purpose of a business partner from an external application?“.
We configured the “Business Partner End of Purpose Check from SAP Business Suite” communication scenario.
In the Cloud Applications Studio we added the CheckBusinessPartnerEndOfPurpose Enhancement.
At CPI we configured the iFlow “Business Partner End of Purpose Check from SAP ERP”.
To test if everything was configured properly, we tried to send following xml via above mentioned iFlow to the webservice: 

Without further implementation in the enhancement, the iFlow completes and provides the following response:


Unfortunatly I was not able to find any further Documentation on how to use Enhancement, so I tried to find out via try and error, how to, for example, set the PurposeCompletionCode to 2.
My approach was:

When sending above xml again, I got exactly the same response as before. The PurposeCompletedStatus has not been changed. 
Now I need to ask for your help to find, where to look for my mistake. Is it the implementation? Is it the wrong Enhancement? Are there further steps I missed out on?
Does someone know a more detailed guide or example for the End-of-purpose-web-service integration?
Thank you very much in advance!

Hi experts,
we are looking for the table names that include the applied characteristics referring to one or more of these objects:

Subscription Order (transaction type PRVO)
Subscription Contract (transaction type PRVC)
Materialnumber/-ID (CRMS4D_SERV_I-ORDERED_PROD)

The characteristics are set within the FIORI/WebUI in the product configuration when creating a subscription order with a configurable product.
FIORI App: Manage Subscription OrdersApp-ID: TBT265SR
These characteristics are linked to materials over a configuration profile (transaction: PMEVC) where we defined them and set values if they were distinct. Configurable products can have one or more of these characteristics. 
The characteristics and its values are stored in these tables:

CABN - Characteristics
CAWN - Values of Characteristics 

Unfortunately these tables only contain the definitions and have no link to the mentioned objects.
Here are some articles referring to tables but none of them was the one in question:

Table names in Variant Configuration
Variant Configuration tables
Characteristics Values

In table CRMS4D_SERV_I (contains data for subscription orders and contracts) there is a field called INT_OBJ_NO (internal configuration) which seems to be distinct (= every value appears once) but we are not sure if it is a link for what we are looking for.We tried using the where-used-list but could not find the table.Using the SQL-Trace (transaction ST05) we only find the line where it inputs the values but not the table name we are looking for.


Do you know the tables or have any advice?
Thanks in advance!

We found the relevant tables and fields. To find the applied/assessed values for product configuration characteristics linked to a specific object like
try the following:
Hope this process graphics helps:

Hi Wolfgang, maybe transaction CUTABLEINFO helps. 
you can try using FM VC_I_GET_CONFIGURATION with INT_OBJ_NO from CRMS4D_MAGR_I table to read teh VC details. You can also try FM CUAB_DISPLAY_CD_CONFIGURATION to get the data. 
If you are looking for tables specifically please look into these FMs for the info. I believe the tables are same in CRM S/4 HANA as SD S/4 HANA 
Dear gurus,
do you know if operation subcontracting is integrated in ePPDS?
We are using embedded PPDs on S4. We need to hata a operation of routing worked externally. Components should be consumed from a subcontracting MRP area that is replanished from a storage location. 
We created a routing with one operation. The operation is a subcontracting operation (with control key PP02 as well). In suboperation is linked a scheduling agreement as suboperation object. 
Running on core no problem appears, production order creates a purchase requisition that consumes components from MRP area. 
Running on ePPDS side system doesn't create an consumption from MRP area because components are consumed directly from plant storage location and not from MRP area.

Background:
The A1 certificate proves a traveler is subject to the social security rules of his or her home country and hence does not have to pay social security to a country he or she is working in temporarily.
The A1 requirement, which has been in effect in EU member states since 2010, targets workers traveling from one EU member state, plus Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein or Switzerland to another of those countries on a temporary basis, whether for contracted services, working for one's own company in a different country or hired out through a temporary agency. Even attending a (business) conference requires A1.
My question:
Is anyone using SF to run or even support this process e.g. along with Concur? I know there're solutions available for Concur integrating with SAP HCM but I'm specifically interested if anyone is using SF for this.
Any feedback from anyone having a solution in place, a potential vendors name etc. would be apprechiated.

Hey there Michael. Thanks for sharing the info. As for your question, I'm not familiar with using SF for this process specifically, but I've heard that some companies use it for travel management in general, including booking flights. It might be worth checking with some vendors or doing some research to see if there are any solutions available that integrate with SF. Good luck with your search, and I hope you find the right solution for your needs! And if you're looking for some great deals on business flights, don't forget to check out business class flights for some awesome discounts and promotions. Safe travels!
 Hello there everybody, 

right now I'm facing an very awful problem. My task is to create a report that should be run by RSNAST00 for a certain message type. The report should create a invoice document with the help of SAP-script, but it should create this invoice document under certain conditions. If the invoice should send by mail, I have to receive the OTF-data. After that the data should be converted to binary data and attached as a PDF-File to the mail. The previous results a very satisfying, everything works. The mail is send to the receiver. The attachments are part of the mail. BUT during my test I recognized that the invoice document is not archived to our digital file archive. The normal case is that an printed invoice document is stored in the archive as a PDF-file. I searched for a solution and found the reason why I these document is not stored in the archive. If you extract the OTF-Data while creating the invoice document by SAP-script, the function "OPEN_FORM" will not archiving the following document. I found an evidence for this assumption, as i debugged through the "OPEN_FORM"-function. 

"threat GETOTF like preview: no archiving, no data is sent to spool
if itcpp-tdgetotf = 'X'.
     itcpp-tdpreview = 'X'.
endif.

Here is my question! How do I archiving the invoice document although I extract the OTF-Data? 
(ATTENTION! Any spools should be created) Greetings GollmerBZ 
UPDATE:
I use the FM "CONVERT_OTF" to create bin data for the PDF-attachment. This FM owns a parameter called archive_index. Am I able to archive the invoice with the help of the FM CONVERT_OTF??? Edited by: GollmerBZ on Dec 29, 2010 11:28 AM 

Hi,

      You should create a Spool for the generated PDF.

Hi 

Not able to do payment in Hybris 2205 

My sop.post.url is https://localhost:9002/acceleratorservices/sop-mock/process and my website url is https://electronics.local:9002/winpartsstorefront It is giving Invalid CORS Request. Please help on the same
Have you set the property `acceleratorservices.payment.sopmock.enabled` to true?
It is set to false by default so you should set it in your `local.properties` file
You can see the code where it returns a 404 in `de.hybris.platform.acceleratorservices.web.payment.interceptors.PaymentMockControlHandlerInterceptor`
I have binded a model with json data of 4 items to sap.m.SelectDialog. below are items
1. apple
2. banana
3. orange
4. carrot
Now I have selected 2 items (Multi Select) apple and banana. In the Select dialog it shows 2 items are selected ��
Now you search for the item that is not present, say I searched for raddish and after filter list has no items. But since previously I have selected ☑ 2 items it shows count 2
When you click on the finish button. On the event confirm I have 0 selected items (oEvent.getParameter("selectedItems")) ��
But if you take list I'd of the dialog box 
var list = sap.ui.getCore().byId("dialog-list") 
var selected = list.getSelectedContextPaths()
Then this alternate way gives me the 2 selecteditems.
I don't find any methods to clear all selections, alternate way I found to set showClearButton true, get that button id and firepress from core ��
I don't find any method to pass an array of indicies and select the dialog items manually in the multi select dialog. 
Is there any stable version of this control. Or do I need to use another to satisfy my basic scenarios? 
Hi Sagar, don't use (oEvent.getParameter("selectedItems") but different method call :var aObject = oEventAttachConfrim.getParameter("selectedContexts");is better for your scope. Sebastiano
Hi,
I am a bit confused around multitenancy for a pure sapui5 app deployed with a standalone approuter. There are a lot of information around introducing multitenancy to a CAP app, but cannot find how can i make a pure sapui5 app multitenant with options to susbcribe to the app and options to have different URL pointing to the approuter for each customer. Am i missing something in understanding how this works? 
irst thing you need to have an Approuter module, to be able to isolate each tenants identity provider.
Second thing is just deploy your applications to an HTML5 Application Repository app-host instance and bind HTML5 Application Repository app-runtime instance to your approuter.
Then you will have a multitenant frontend application in SAP BTP CF Runtime.

Hi,
In the Email Lite, I used an Interaction block.
I want to personalize some fields based on interaction data.
It concerns interactions without a product assignment though.
In the Product Lines part of the Interaction block, I diminished the nr of products to be shown to 0.
In the text part of the interactions block, I have my text and the interaction field that I need in the personalization.
When I now use this email in a campaign, the performance shows me that the email was not sent due to "no products found".
When I indicate in the interaction block that the mail can be sent even if no items are found, then the interaction block doesn't appear in the email.
So, is there no way to use the interaction block, for interactions that do not have an underlying product level?! 
Thanks for your insights,

Hi Experts,

I have one File to File without ESR scenario where I have to pick multiple files from different directories and to save them in different directories on receiver side.

Can anyne help me to send multiple files in different directories using receiver file adapter.
Is it possible??
Any help will be appreciated.

Regards,
Danish
Yes it is possible. Use 2 reciever agreements with 2 different reciever channels. Add 2 recievers in reciever determination.

Regards,
Sekhar
try this, it should work for sender and receiver-

http://wiki.sdn.sap.com/wiki/display/XI/FileSenderAdapter-PollingMultipleDirectories 

Save file in multiple directories using receiver file adapter?
hi ,

that is possiable without esr,

we need to create one sender communication channel , in that we nend to use "adavnced selection for source file " for sending multiple files from multiple directories.

we need to create 'n' receiver communication channels and 'n' receiver agreements based on communication channels .
 
in receiver determination, provide multiple receivers 

In interface determination , provide * symbol for receiver communication components
.

thanks,
Hi Bhavani,

If I want to send the files on same rceiver but in different directories.
Please tell me the exact configuration of Interface determination, receiver agreemennt and receiver comm channel.

regards
Hi Bhavani

I have done the configuration as suggested by you but both files are going in same directory.
Second receiver adapter is not placing the file in its directory.The second file is also going in the directory in which first is going.
Please tell me where I am going wrong and what is the possible solution.

danish
hello experts.
We are having a complication in a client's request, he was managing a table in JAVA that appeared as follows.

As you can see, the table has a row where it shows the information and then a row with a Total: plus the amount.
The serious question is there a way to replicate it in ui5?
since we have the table made, but in this way.

(at the moment the final total is test, it is not the real value)
but they tell us that although the footer with the final total is fine, they want to see the subtotals of each of the values in the table.Is there any way to be able to do it? I thought because I saw there that they could be grouped, but I don't understand how a table is grouped, could that be an option? or some other way to do it?
maybe some different kind of table?
I await your responses.
Thank you for reading
Greetings.
ebz.
Displaying the subTotal row is completely depending upon the condition when you want to display ?

You need to create a new Context with old Node structure.

double sum;
for(i=0;i<wdContext.Node<<Data>>().size;i++)
{
sum = sum + wdContext.current<Data>element.get<amount>();

//Copy the node contents into a new Node of same structure

If(Condition)
{
//Add a new Row in the new node for the subTotoal
}

}
Hi, 
we are using SAP CAP but when I want to use an IN clause in a $filter variable so like:
http://localhost:4004/v1/api/SomeEntity?$filter=myId in ('0001','0002')
I get:

<error xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/metadata">    <code>400</code>    <message>The type 'Edm.String' is not compatible to 'Edm.Boolean'</message></error>
Does CAP support the IN clause in a filter?
Hi  Ramon Beijer ,
This is not supported yet, but we're already working on it (CAP Node.js).

Hello CC team.
On one of my Dispatcher (slave) I had Warning message: "Request Processor Queue Full for Internal Admin Pool".
A few moments later, this Dispatcher (slave) considered that it was the Master and began to form its own Rater's map and redistribute partitions for the Raters. As a result, some of the raters (5/9) who got into his map (message on 5/9 Raters: Instance is registered to the master dispatcher) started warming up the cache. After a few more moments, this fake-master restarted (message on Dispatcher: Instance stopping and starting again for an internal reason). Original Master Dispatcher didn't rebuild his Rater's map (9/9).
All this led to an imbalance of partitions between Raters and invalidation of the cache (on one Rater, the activation process took 6 hours instead of 50 minutes)
Tell me please
1) How is configured size of the queue Internal Admin Pool (didn't find the parameter in the documentation)?
2) How to monitor current value of the queue Internal Admin Pool?
3) How to protect from the situation with fake-master Of Dispatcher?
Best regards.

Dear All,
To authenticate API, in security policy of proxy pre-flow we can add verify API key. API key can be generated with help of Product/Application.
However instead of apikey, we want to secure our API with basic auth or client I'd/secret Id.
Is this possible.? We don't see any policy that says verify basic auth or verify client Id.
Can someone help to confirm, I checked documentation but was not able to find anything on thiss

Dear all!
We are working on improving our Learning Home Page (Learning Landing Page) by creating custom tiles and add/remove certain things in the configuration. In the Roadmap for SF Learning, there is an item related to the Learning Home Page, which states that by the end of this year, there will be a new experience in the Learning Home Page: 

We would like to know the impact of this new Learning Home Page, before we invest a lot of time in rebuilding the current Learning Home Page. Will all configuration (custom tiles, enabled tiles/tabs) be transferred/transported from the current Learning Home Page to the new Learning Home Page? Or will all configuration and functionality be different by the end of the year? And would it then be a 'waste' of time to invest in improving it now, because it would only be a mid-term solution? 
If you have any questions, please let me know!
Looking forward to your input and details regarding the new Learning Home page
Best, Marij
Hello Community,
we have seen a wired bug that has driven us and the customer mad.
As you noticed by the title, all the lists that will appear from a combobox, select or simply the suggestionItems of an Input field will be "reopened" after they have been closed by the user and also a navigation to another view has happened.
One additional info: This only happens if the user clicks at least once on one item but the pre selected one, so we have a change of the value. 
See sceenshots below



As you can see from the third picture, the dialogs have been opened. They can be closed again by clicking on one element. As far as I know, it does not have any effect on further actions within this app. Still, its very annoying and reduces UX heavily. 
So far my attemtemps to fix this issue:
1. Destroy the view in onExit() method of the controller. -> Does not work
2. Remove the DOM Objects in the onRouteMatched Method -> This kind of works but its not generic enough to just apply this to everything: 
 _onRouteMatched: function () { 
 var aDOMObjects = document.querySelectorAll('[id^="container-myView---Create"]') 
 aDOMObjects.forEach(element => { if(element instanceof HTMLDivElement){ if(element.style.visibility != "hidden"){ element.remove(); } } }); }, 
But this only works until you reopen the create view again because it will look like this:

3. instead of element.remove() from the second idea: element.style.visibility = "hidden"
--> The Create view wont be rendered because everything is hidden
Any further suggestions or ideas to fix this issue? 
Thanks
Jan
What UI5 versions are reported when you press [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [Left Alt] + [P]?
Might be already fixed with https://github.com/SAP/openui5/commit/f30e828fd391c4e2d2335030d47f5280fa52d7ef
I doubt the fix will be downported to the 1.110 release. You'll have to wait for 1.111.
Hi Experts,
We are getting an error while trying to connect to a system from SAP CPI using Odata Receiver Adapter. We are able to connect only if we select Local EDMX as Connection Source but if we select as remote, its throwing an exception as "Failed to connect to system".Could you please let us know the possible solution for this issue as we do not want to use local EDMX option ?
Also used actual configuration parameters. We do not have location ID so we kept blank.
you should write down real hostname here, at this query generation dialog
Hi mani kantha reddy t,
could you please check if the user has sufficient roles.
hope that helps !
thanks and regards,
Praveen t
Hi mani kantha reddy t,
Not necessarily, local EDMX the metadeta is referred locally so you must not need to make a call to fetch the metadata.
I would suggest to check on the backend system for issues.
thanks and regards,

Hi, 
Can you try and run a connectivity test from the Monitor tab in Cloud Integration and see what happens? Maybe there is an issue with Cloud Connector setup. 
Is it also possible to check the Error Logs in S4 to see if the connection is made but that it runs into an S4-side error. 
Kind regards,
David
Is this issue solved ? Can one of you post here with the resolution , we are getting the same error . 
Hi ,
Can you please confirm ,you are connecting to the Internet not the On-Premise Option right?
Thanks and Regards,
Vijay
Hi Archana,
In that case you will need to use the EDMX way of configuration only and once you are done with the config of query then you can run end to end to test.
Thanks and Regards,
Vijay

I'm working through this tutorial and reached step #8 where I have to Create IAM App and business catalog. This seems to work but I then don't see an option to "save and activate" thi IAM as instructed because the activate icon is greyed out in the menu:

I see the IAM listed with the transport, so things seem to have worked fine up to that point:

Update: poking around a bit, I found the IAM in the project explorer and upon right-clicking, I did see an option to "Activate" it:

I didn't see any obvious messages, but the lock icon has vanished from the icon.
Why is the icon to activate an object greyed out in the menu bar but is available via the project explorer's context menu? This is at least somewhat confusing for newbies to all of this like me who are really easy to confuse!
Thanks much and cheers

unable to extract more than 1 doc in the F.62
HI all,
So we have 2 TRs. One containing an odata service and another containing the system alias for it. I wanted to know what is the exact sequence for moving it into quality. Should I move the odata service, activate it in SICF in quality and then move the system alias or move both TRs together and then activate it in SICF?
Thank you.
move together then activate sicf
For a customer we're using Inventory Management and HU-Management with idocs.In some cases they want to pack products on an empty HU. For this to work we thought to use HU_PACK idoc.Unfortunately we experience errors in the processing. When trying to pack items from partner location to HU we see: "Storage location 3000 is HU-managed. Entry not possible"
What I found was a difference in foreground and background processing. Where we can select 2 storage locations (from-to) in HU02 for packing, the HU_PACK idoc only supports one field for storage location.
Therefor I'm unable to define from which location I want to pack my items. What is striking is that once the HU already has some items on it, the processing of this idoc goes very well. It seems SAP then does know how to perform the from-to packing action, but for empty HU's this won't work.
After debugging the FM we have no clue how this should work, perhaps we're missing something. Anyone experience with this idoc or this process?
 HU02: 

 HU_PACK 

 Anyone perhaps some experience with these idoc types? 
The answer from SAP was that the HU_PACK idoc isn’t able to pack directly to a HU-managed location. You first need to use the HU_PACK idoc for packing in the non-HU location and afterwards move using WMMBXY and movement type 311/323/325 to move it over to the HU storage location.
So to summarize:
First increase stock using WMMBXY or similar idoc in NON-HU location.
Second use HU_PACK for packing. Still in the NON-HU location.
Last the transfer to the HU-location using WMMBXY or similar idoc.

Hi All,
 I am wrting BDC for QA11 tc, but I am getting one popup message which is not recorded in the sourced code.


Please let me know how to surpress this popup.

Thanks in Advance.

Regards,
Pr
Hi,

I think based on the data entering in QA11, the pop up is dynamically calling.
so, try to find for which data the popup is coming, and write a condition in the program for that case to call pop up.

Regards,
Pavan
Hi Prakash,

The popup cannot be suppressed, as that is occurring in the the flow of the transaction.
 If you want to suppress the popup you need to go for a proper BAPI which suits for QA11.

If you want to continue with BDC, you need to record the transaction once again with the popup and implement the recording steps in your program.

Regards,
Phani.
You can't suppress the popup window. 

1. Do one recording with popup window and implement with your coding

I think this might be SAP NOTE 

Before that screen of POP uP 

Use ok_code  '/00'

Try with this .
I have used BAPI myself
I am facing the same issue, i am using tcode i am getting the output on a popup and i find a bapi for upload program but still when I am passing and executing that I am getting the same popup how get tid off that popup and i want to show the data on alv display 
Many important tables in SAP FI-CA use the same naming convention whereby they start with "DFKK". Examples 
DFKKKO: Header Data in Open Item Accounting Document DFKKOP: Items in contract account document DFKKOPK: G/L Items in contract account document DFKKOPW: Repetition Items in contract account document DFKKSUM*: Documents transferred to General ledger (reconciliation keys)
From looking at other modules, I would say "D" and "FKK" stand for separate things but it would be helpful to relate a meaningful business term to these abbreviations. Does anyone know (or at least have a good guess...) what they stand for ?
A valuable tip that I can give you is: navigate to related package and read its description, because the abbreviations probably came from there (English or German, ancient objects were developed in German as main language).
Now, the answer and guesses:
KK: stands for Kontokorrent, German for Account.
F: I'm guessing it's because it is a FI-CA object (F for FI).
D: another guess, and this is based on naming patterns in other tables in this package and other modules. This prefix is just to describe that is a transactional data table, because master data tables like FKKVK* (Contract Account) don't have this prefix.
Hi Said,
The table names are in German.
It seems you might find the below thread interesting :

Hello Comunity,
I have a requirement from business and I need some help.
We have 2 situations:
- If I have an invoice that it comes from an external system to FSCD with €100 and a payment of €98 (difference less or equal €3), I must be able to clear these 2 documents with transactions FPE1, FP06, FPMA or FPY1, posting the difference to a cost GL account
- If I have an invoice that it comes from an external system to FSCD with a value less or equal €3, I don't want clear this document with transaction FPMA
Can you give me some suggetions to answer this business requirement ?
Thank you for your support.
Hi Antonio,
best case the two invoices are for different group of customers. So, you could control it with different clearing category and tolerance group on contract account level.
Best Regards,
Tobias
Hi Friends, 
Would you please share SAP FSCD module overview and any documents that help learning the basics of the module? any help on this matter would be highly appreciated.
Thank you all!

Dear Gurus,
We have a commissions process setup where an agent is setup as a supplier (vendor) in SAP. After setting up of the contract in WCOCO, we have created sales orders and invoices where the RCA1 condition is determined into the documents. We are now trying to settle the contract and are receiving this error in WB2R_SV:

Our supplier (Agent) is from Turkey (TR), we have setup RET0 records for the combination of TR/DE/1

Can someone please assist on this error?
Have a look at this Wiki
We found the solution to this - The condition record for MWVS condition type was maintained for country TR in FV11. This solved our issue.
Hello Experts,
We have many existing FSCD transactional loads into our system daily. We are using the sender structure RKCT027. This works great and has for years. We receive data for collections on these feeds to collect money and post other accounting documents. This file identifies which bank details to use and that we already have stored at the business partner level and the payment method. Those bank details are fed from prior master data file and are regular details that used.
We have new request for a new feed from a client facing web portal to submit payments to a specified bank account of their choice. These details are not stored in the system for the business partner and we don't intend to store them. They are a one time use and chosen by the client when the enter it into the portal. What I want to know is it still possible to use the same sender structure RKCT027 for this new feed with the one time bank account and routing information without having to store the banking details at business partner i the master data? The sender structure does currently have the bank account, routing information etc. fields available.
I'm just looking to see if I'm going down the wrong rabbit hole or if someone could point me in the correct direction. 
Thanks,
Joe
Hi Joseph,
if you are using payment run (TC FPY1) there is no chance to use bank details without store them on business partner level.

Goodmorning,
I've created an Adobe Form invoice (tcode SFP) which take all SD data.
I've write ABAP code, I used the classic FM for the Adobe Forms, and create the module and the interface.

All works very well.
Then I saved the form in application server with format '.pdf' and automatically save the PDF in a local directory.
The problem is when I open the file PDF. I can open the file with Microsoft Edge and all data are displayed correctly but I can't open the PDF file with Adobe Acrobat that installed on my PC.
Now I'm blocked because I need to open the file PDF with Adobe Acrobat.
I've serched online but I can't take a solution, have you got any ideas or suggestions?

Hello,
It would be easy to read if you add your code clicking 'code' icon.
As for your code, you can use "Value", instead of appending structure to internal table.
Simultenously you can "Corresponding" to map entries of one internal table to another.
Have a look to this blog as quick reference - ABAP 7.40 Quick Reference
Hallo,
how to sign a given xString in ABAP with RSA-PSS algorithm.
Please also provide a code example. Thank you!
Greeting
Philipp Wallutis
It is correct. CCL is capable of a lot of things. But not all of them are exposed to ABAP. And none of them is officially supported.
This one (RSA Sign with PSS padding) can be used from ABAP.
For code examples have a look here.
Then in SSFW_KRN_SIGN use str_format = 'PKCS1-PSS' instead of 'PKCS1-V1.5'. It was tested and works.
Happy hacking.
Hello Community,
Does anyone have, or know, where I can find a user guide for this tcode ?
Hi Antonio,
I don't know where you can find a user guide. If you become familiar with direct input and BDT, you should be able to learn it by 'try and error' approach. So please check Data Transfer (Direct Input) and Business Data Toolset.

Hello, 
We have a custom app that is deployed in BTP CF environment. 
The app uses a destination to make various API calls to the S4HC tenant. 
Recently the app was redeployed (some changes were made and then reverted as they were not needed so the app's code has not changed). Since this redeployment, we face the following errors on the destination: 

Failed to get destination
Http status code 401. Response body '{"error":"unauthorized","error_description":"Bad credentials"}'

The error does not make sense to me as we have a binding between the app and the destination instance and this has worked fine for over a year. 
We have tried various routes to fix this but it is unclear where this error comes from. 
Is it possible that the binding in runtime is using the wrong client id and secret?
Has anybody else had a similar issue and resolved it?
Kind regards,
David 
Hello, 
It seems there was an issue with the app router version and the node modules version being deployed. App router only supports up to a certain version of node modules and we were using the incorrect one. 
Issue was fixed by specifying the correct engine needed inside of the app's package.json. 
Kind regards,
David 
Hi David Da Silva,
There are at least tree places where you can store the data for a destination:
1 - one that is global at the subaccount level 2 - another one at the destination service level (plan = light)3 - on MTA.yaml - which creates an environment variable for the application itself.
Check if your application is using one or the other. Usually people create the same destination name on both stances which makes it confusing to troubleshoot issues like this one. 
I usually I start by deleting the destination that is created on the destination service instance. If the application doesn't complain about a missing destination with that name you can inspect the one that is available on the destination menu on the subaccount level. If that doesn't solve the credentials issue you are having, than it was using a destination defined on the MTA.yaml. To make sure, check the environment variables for that particular app and update them accordingly (usually I wouldn't use system credentials stored this way as they would be clear texto for anyone that has access to the cockpit.
Best regards,Ivan
There is a standard ACH collections (NACHA) file format that can be generated via the CD payment program (FPY1). We need the ability to add a custom field (ACH Reference Number). This field will be utilized to send a unique number to the bank with the idea that when we receive an ACH return file from the bank, the bank will send this number back to us and a return lot will be created using this reference number to find the original payment..
Please help me how can I enhance ACH collections
Hello SAP Expert,
ach-file-blank-records.jpg
My client is using ACH payment for sent payment to customer, vendor and payroll, normally every time ACH file successfully created with relevant information and sent to to bank after go live 2019 in S/4 HANA 1610. But some time when proposal run file was generated without any information and sent to bank and we received email from bank that file received without any information. This issue not frequently happed and due to company policy we can not debug this issue in production client -or- we can not replicate this issue in other clients. Could you please let me know how can I find out root cause of this issue. Please find attached AL11 report for ACH file.
Thank you,
Chetan Bhatt
Hi Fayaz,
In general, you should copy format ACH to a custom specific format and use this for your enhancements.
You could use your own function modules to generate ACH file. Please check under Contract Accounts Receivable and Payable -> Business Transactions -> Incoming/Outgoing Payment Creation -> Payment Medium -> Define Payment Medium Formats for format ACH the event modules. You could use event 31 to add ACH Reference Number?

Hi All,
My requirement is that duplex printing should be there for my form. Front side page wouldn’t be flowed but back side page has a table which is flowed.So suppose my input is sales order. Front side of the page will have all header info of this sales order and back side will have it’s items info.
But now if the items table is flowed and I need 2nd page then the next page front should have same header and back side should continue with next items in the table.
What pagination or settings I need for such output? I have created a Master Page with 2 body pages. Should I do something else? Thank you in advance ��P.S. I am relatively new to Adobe Forms 
Hi @ M zainy,
I think you are looking to add items flowing under same header. Did you check the option under object tab for body role to include header in subsequent pages?
Attaching image for reference.

Refer to Pagination options on right, let me know if it helps to respond to your query
I have a table where on pressing Create, a new editable row is inserted at the top of the table. On saving, this new record is saved to the backend but instead of refreshing the table binding, I need to keep this record at the top with the highlighter. 
Current Code:
On Create Press:
onCreate: function (oEvent) { 
const oItem = this._addNewColumnListItem();
this.oTable.insertItem(oItem, 0); 
},

_addNewColumnListItem: function (sNameList) { 
const nameColumn = new sap.m.Input(this.createId("Name"), {
  type: sap.m.InputType.Text }
 );
return new sap.m.ColumnListItem({ cells: [nameColumn], highlight: "Information" }); 
},

On Save:
onSave: async function (oEvent) { 
await this._oService.createMed(this.byId("Name").getValue(), selectedKey ); 
this.onCancel(); 
}, 

onCancel: function (oEvent) { 
this.oTable.getItems()[0].destroy(); 
await this.oTable.getBinding("items").refresh(); 
},
Hi Avantika Singh - Well, in this case you can use sorting machanism to pull the latest index in top of the table. 
i.e Use sap.ui.model.Sorter

Hi,
I have a simple RAP based OData Service with two custom entities which are associated one to another like so:
Root entity "RUN"

Root entity "MESSAGE"

So when I call all or a single "run" entity/ies, everything works fine. 
Now I want to call the navigation property "to_Messages" of a single "run" entity, to display the results in a lineitem annotation like so:
/sap/opu/odata/sap/ZBI_MXF_RUN/ZDD_I_MXF_RUN(vtype='AB02FG',run_id='206')/to_Messages
I thought that as soon as I call the association, the RAP framework would call the if_rap_query_provider~select method of the class, which I defined in the child(associated) entity, like ZCL_CE_MXF_MESSAGE but instead, the framework calls the select method of the "run" entity in the ZCL_CE_MXF_RUN class. 
If this works as intended how can I distinguish, which association was called? In the debugger it seems that it is a normal getEntity call of the "Run" entity with no additional information about the association or anything else, that could help me. 

When I call the "Message" entity itself, the corresponding select method in the "Message" class is called. But not when I call it as an association of the "Run" Entity. I configured the relation between the two entities as composition in the first place, like in the answer of Andre Fischer in the question https://answers.sap.com/questions/13631104/abap-rap-complex-logic-for-read.html, but it was no difference.
Did I configured something wrong?
Best Regards
Dominik
Hi Dominik,
when querying data via navigation, the framework checks for the existence of unmanaged queries (@Objectmodel.Query.Implementedby) in the navigation path and splits the query in subqueries for each involved unmanaged query. In your case, the "run" is queried with a filter containing the instance keys vtype = 'AB02FG' and run_id = '206'. This is the "existence check" for the source of a navigation. If the unmanaged query returns the instance, the information from that query is used to query the unmanaged query of the target.
In the assocation condition you have defined that _messages.run_id = run.run_id and _messages.vtype = run.vtype. The values from the existence check query of "run" are used and replaced in the assocation condition resulting in:_messages.vtype= 'AB02FG' and _messages.run_id = '206'
This filter is then passed to your unmanaged query of the "message" entity.
In general you can use the ABAP Cross Trace to check the orchestration and execution of a query/request by the RAP frameworks: https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/5371047f1273405bb46725a417f95433/290647b75cea46f491907889251ad067.html
When creating a configuration ensure that you have selected the RAP Orchestration and Query entries.
Best regards,Dominik
Hi Dominik :),
thanks for this clarification! My logic stopped at the existence check, because in my getEntity Method I did not call the paging methods, so the framework threw an error regarding this. I fixed that, and now the select method of the associated entity is getting called!
Thank a lot!!
Best Regards
Dominik
Hello together,
we reduced the Path of the URL Webservice on our Webdispatcher.
Now the path is: https://<Webdispatcher-Adress>/TBO
the original path was: https://<Webdispatcher-Adress>/dswsbobje/services/Session
With the short path we have the Problem, that there is now no longer an entry in the field Authentification
and we get the warn message "error by the check of availability from SAP Business Objects Business Intelligence" beside the field "URL Webservice"Is it not allowed to short the path of the URL Webservice?
Best Regards
Bri
I would suspect that BO uses other services outside the URL "https://<Webdispatcher-Adress>/dswsbobje/services/Session", like something this "https://<Webdispatcher-Adress>/sso" (just an example). With the short URL there is no way to access it.
I would to suggest to use a redirect instead of short it.

Hi Experts
We have one SAP Marketing Cloud System and by default, Identity Authentication has been provided as IdP for this tenant.
According to SAP Help this setup is fixed and cannot be changed, we can't replace the IAS IdP with our corporate IdP.
We would like to configure the Identity Authentication as a proxy for our corporate IdP.
Questions:
1. Since the IAS is already the SMC IdP, we only need to configure IAS to trust our corporate Idp, correct?
2. Is it possible to access the IAS IdP Admin Console in order to exchange the metadatas with or corporate IdP?
If yes, which URL should be used? Otherwise do we need to raise an Incident and provide the corporate IdP metadata?
Cheers
Hi Marian,
regarding your first question, you should find all the needed information here: https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/19f3eca47db643b6aad448b5dc1075ad.html?locale=en-US
Regarding your second question, your IAS Url should look like that: https://<tenantid>.accounts.ondemand.com/
So, <tenantid> could be for example a2xarnu21
Then the URL for the admin console would look like that: https://a2xarnu21.accounts.ondemand.com/admin/
The person who got the initial provisioning email for the IAS tenant should be your first administrator for that tenant and can access it and create more administrators.
Hope that helps.

The following document has information about redistribution rules for server application in page 4: http://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/scn/go/portal/prtroot/docs/library/uuid/70bd6328-4128-2d10-7882-d7b95418dbaa?QuickLink=index&…

The app that I'm trying to build and redistribute is (I think) considered a Server application. For server applications this document says that the developer must acquire a copy of Crystal Report for each 3rd party deployment. To comply with this requirement what exactly must be done? Do we have to contact SAP sales and ensure that these Crystal Report licenses (1 for each app deployment) get purchased under my company's account? Also, what Crystal Report Product would be sufficient in terms of complying with this licensing requirement? Sap Crystal Reports 2013?

Thanks in advance. 
Hi Andrew


Yes, please do contact sales. They know this licensing better that anyone. NA ph: 866-681-3435.

Hi,

I'm calling SOAP Web service from SAP. I've created service consumer class and logical port in SAOMANAGER and everything works fine. 
This external service is still in development and sometimes it adds new endpoints. 
I can regenerate consumer class and new methods are available there but logical port doesn't update operations binding. Is it possible to regenerate logical port as well (in SAOMANAGER or with ABAP)?
Now I have to delete current port and create new one with new endpoint bindings. It may be frustrating as we can have multiple endpoints with different users for basic authentication. 

Thanks in advance

Dear SAP Community, I have a problem with the Flexible Column Page. According to the documentation, „If Flexible Column Layout page has no title, no action bar item, and is the first page of application, the action bar is hidden.“ (

 These three requirements are fulfilled, but the Action Bar is not hidden. In iOS, it displays an empty bar and in Android, it contains the App Name displayed in the launcher, like „Mobile Svcs“ for the public store client. Same on both Phones and Tablets.

Hello everyone,
I have a user requirement where I need to clear only a specific currency during payment lot posting or automatic clearing.
The client's system for the longest time transacts only using one currency, XXX, and is also the CCode currency. They have since introduced a contract account type that uses a second currency, YYY. As per business requirement and process, transactions and payments between these two currencies are segregated, i.e. CA's using XXX currency should only have XXX payments and debit items posted to them, likewise to CA's of YYY currency.
However, there are rare instances where user will incorrectly post an XXX payment to a YYY contract account. These are usually reversed later on and posted to the correct CA, but in the meantime, the effect is that when automatic clearing is executed or a YYY payment is posted to the account while the YYY payment is still open credit, the clearing document converts the cleared amount to XXX currency, which impacts other processes downstream since YYY currency is only expected for this CA type.
The projected solution, therefore, is to introduce a clearing variant step that is a copy of the clearing steps of XXX currency, but is specific only to the YYY currency along with its main and sub-transactions. The objective is that even if multiple currencies are selected from the CA during the clearing process, only YYY currency items are to be cleared, and no conversion should occur. Can anyone, therefore suggest what settings need to be applied, such as grouping characteristics, grouping rules, etc.? Thank you in advance.
Hi Maria,
in general, you should define a custom specific external grouping feature. In exit TFK116 (see template FKK_SAMPLE_TFK116) check CA and which currency is allowed and compare it with the currency of the item, then set T_e516_fkkcl-e_zreg_te516 = '3'. Use this grouping feature in your first clearing step of your clearing variant.

Tobias

in credit memo request business process flow -  with reference to invoice or sale order , you create the credit memo request .
this is standard process, why you create the cancel invoice reference . i think it not possible , 

 in credit memo request , document setting you can check at vov8 , their is any reference mandatory   field can assign , check this , you do not want this filed please remove , based on this system ask the mandatory invoice at creation of credit memo request .

please check this\

regards 
sankar
hi 
You could create a credit memo by the original billing document F2 instead of using the ref. of the cancelled billing doc ( s1) .
You cant create a credit memo with ref. of a S1 doc . Its not standard .

1. How to create a Intra STO PR automatically?
2. My client has one demand in that they want to create STO automatically with following scenario:Suppose one supplying plant can't able to fulfil order (due to lack of stock) then STO should be placed for other Plant automatically? Is there any possibility to create such.
Thanks.
Dear Pratik Zopate,
1) You can use special procurement key in order to let MRP create PurReqs with item category "U".
You can refer to this link in part "Stock transfer":
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/ERPMan/Special+procurement+types+-+effects+in+MRP
When spec. proc. key is created, you then have to maintain in material master on MRP2 view for selected material.
2) I think this can be achieved via APO. If your client is using it, you can consider this option. 
(not 100% sure if applicable also for STO, but for sure for SO)
Hi,
I have been checking the roadmap for stories and dashbords, but I haven´t found any information about when scheduling and publishing will be available for Optimized stories. Can anyone help provinding this information?
Also, if we want to publish an Optimized story is there any workaround without having to re create the story as a non optimized one?
Thanks in advance!

dears,
we have a bussiness cases that to give a driver 10 USD commission for each trip 
i know there is no standard process to handle this case, but is there is any idea for a custom solution to achieve this ?
thanks
Hi Ahmed,
How do you expected to pay the commission to the Driver? 
Direct in FI?
Regards
Hi,
you can create a Query for the Freight Order Worklist, filter by Driver, range of dates,,,,, etc.

If you want to automatize that you will need development, ( suggest to use the selection criteria's sample the worklist.)
If you pay the commission to a Carrier company them the LSP pay the commission to the driver you should consider to you use one charge type "Commission" in the rates it will be standard concept.

Hello Experts, 
In Opportunity Object, Close Date is set to Today's data when the Opportunity custom status is changed, in our status configuration the custom status are linked to either Won or Lost. 
As per the KBA - https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/1925772, this is expected behavior as per standard. When the Opportunity is set to WON/LOST, then the close date will get updated automatically. 
But, in our process we want to have the dates as entered by user even the Opportunity is closed. Please suggest a solution to overcome the standard system behavior. 
Thanks in Advance...!
Best Regards,
Vignesh Karuppasamy
Hi Vignesh,
our solution:
We added an additional field "Close Date". This date will be manually added by the users at the end of the opportunity process.
As per Workflow definition the "Close date" will be synced with the standard "expected close date" as long as the Opportunity is in process. Closing the Opportunity (won or lost) will update the Close date once and can be updated later on again.

Hi Experts, 
Confirming - in a GR project with S/4 integration - where the Profit centers segments cost centers and functional areas are updated automatically from FI, the Cons Units with Universal Journal Integration must be setup/imported intially in GR FIORI Import Consolidation master data?
Asking because the FI Company codes don't appear as I thought they would and saw a reference in the help below to setting up Cons Units.
Note
If special characters are included in the name, universal journal integration for this consolidation unit is not possible. This is because the system requires a company with the same name as the consolidation unit and special characters are not supported for the company name.
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/4ebf1502064b406c964b0911adfb3f01/a8f3c709a7f642398f1dd15de35b5320.html?version=2020.001.
Thank you
Eyal
Hi Eyal,
Yes. You need to create consolidation units as masterdata in group reporting.
Consolidation units can be integrated with your company code but they could also be consolidation unit that are not in your S/4 environment - or partner units only.
An your are correct. The ID of the consolidation unit need to match the company code if it is an integrated scenario.
You can upload the consolidation units via Excel upload if you have many cons.units.
Best of luck with the project.
Martin Jul
Hi Eyal,
What version of S/4HANA are you on? With S/4 HANA 2022 there is an updated Fiori setup screen in Group Reporting Consolidation Unit Setup that has more capabilities including finally letting you map a company code in S/4HANA to a cons Unit in Group Reporting. Meaning they don't have to be exactly the same any longer.
I realize S/4HANA 2022 just came out last October so it's still very new but did want to let you know.. I think they also increased the size of the Cons Unit code to 18 characters. 
This might have some other dependencies like needing the Group Reporting Preparation Ledger but I don't know for sure as I haven't consumed the training materials. I know this might not resolve your issue but wanted to at least let you know of the recent enhancements in this area. I'll put a screen shot below.

Thank you all for your helpful answers. Arleigh - we are implementing both 2020 2021 on prem (different sites). So Assignment will be useful in future implementations.

In Cloud the dunning charges cannot be deleted actually. You can add lines. The field 'From Dunn.Amt' is a key field, so it cannot be changed. You can change the dunning charge or % value.

Via transaction KCLJ i want to create payment plan items (Payment Plan Interface (Transfer Category 121)). I do not want to use Main Transactions and Subtransactions (fields HVORG / TVORG), i want to use entering account numbers directly (fields S_HKONT H_HKONT) instead.
But without entering Main Transactions and Subtransactions i recieve the following error message:

Is it possible to create payment plan items without using Main Transactions and Subtransactions?
Hi Thomas,

We
are working to release as fast as possible a workaround/fix with 4.2 SP09 Patch

Nevertheless,
since 4.2 is in P1 Support (ANALYTICS BI

for older 4.2 releases. If you are not able to move on latest 4.2 SP09 that is
the only 4.2 release maintained (where fixes can be delivered), we suggest the
workaround listed in the SAP Note 3299450 or to
contact Google to accelerate the resolution.

The latest release of Chrome, version 110.0.5481.100, works and resolves the issue.
4.2 SP9 Patch 13 is still coming out to address it for people who cannot update yet.

I have looked into various answers regarding this topic, however, I still don't get why MCH1 is named as 'Batch (Cross-Plant Batch)
From what I understood, followings are difference between MCH1 and MCHA.
MCH1

Name: Batches (if Batch Management Cross-Plant)
Plant(WERKS) Field: Not Included
Only Created when Plant input is not assigned in 'MSC1N'/
Client Level

MCHA

Name: Batches
Plant(WEKRS) Field: Included
Created regardless of Plant input in 'MSC1N'
Plant Level

Please correct me if above info is incorrect. The part that I do not understand is that it seems MCH1 is being the one having nothing to do with plant(WERKS) yet, its name signifies it has a lot to do with plant. 
In summary, 1) Why is MCH1 named such way, and 2)what are systematic reason behind to distinguish those two tables?
Thanks in advance.
Best Regards
Woojin
Hello
The functional reason for MCH1 table is Batch Level setting. Batches can be managed on 3 levels:
Material and client levels are plant independent or cross-plant. MCH1 is used for those levels.

Hi All,
I have created a report based on UDT universe in web intelligence. I have a column "Country" in the report having 10 different countries. For the moment, I have added specific country in query filter panel and have scheduled the report. Users are getting the reports in their mailbox for that specific country.
I need to schedule the same report for other 3/4 countries. Can somebody please help me understand if the same report can be scheduled for different countries?
I tried with input control filter panel on country column with default filter set on the country. But still, I did not get how we can schedule the same report without making it's replica for other countries.
Thanks.
Bhagya
Create a prompt condition in the webi query and set the recurring schedule for each required country.You need to set the country value in the schedule-Prompts screen.
Bhagya BYes, it is possible to schedule the same report for different countries. You can use input control filters to filter the data based on different countries. This allows you to schedule the same report for multiple countries.

To do this, you will need to create an input control filter on the Country column. Then, when scheduling the report, you can select the countries you want the report to be sent to. This will automatically filter the data in the report according to the countries you selected.

Hope this helps!
Hello,
System is taking Translation Date (BKPF-WWERT) equal to Entry Date (BKPF-CPUDT) in SD/MM related Accounting Documents - MIRO, MIGO, VF01. By default, the system should take the posting date and not the entry date. This is causing issues as incorrect exchange rate is getting determined in underlying accounting documents where Entry Date and posting date of the document are different.
Kindly advise.
Hi
The below OSS Note might be helpful:
2773566 - Procurement: Exchange rate is not consistent between documents. - SAP ONE Support Launchpad
Thanks & Regards
Sanil Bhandari
Sagar Kapadia
The system is designed to take the entry date as the translation date. This is because the exchange rate is determined at the time of the document creation and the system needs to ensure that the same rate is used throughout the document.If you need to use the posting date, then you will need to make a customizing change to the system. This can be done by using the following steps:1. Go to SPRO and navigate to Financial Accounting > Financial Accounting Global Settings > Document > Line Item > Exchange Rate Determination >2. Click on the Exchange Rate Type field and select the appropriate rate type.3. Select the "Base Date" checkbox and enter the relevant posting date into the field.4. Save the settings.Once you have made these changes, the system will use the posting date as the translation date when creating accounting documents.

Delete the enhancement using the Delete Row option

Use the short cut option CTRL+F9.
Hi Saravannan,

 When you create a project in CMOD, there you will go to Enhancements Assignments, there you will be adding the exits and save it and then you will be going to Components tab.

Now in order to delete one of the exit you go to display mode and there you click on Enhancement assignments on application tool bar, then there you place your cursor on the exit you need to delete. 

Then after that you press the icon resides next to display/change button on application tool bar. It is not an option it is a symbol side of change button.

(or)

You press ( CTRL + F9 ) then your exit will be deleted.

I hope it will be clear for you.


Cheers,
Swamy Kunche
thanks experts.
first click on change button then go to components and click on Undo active exits and then go to enhancement assignment and then you able to delete button,

I have a requirement where I need to convert CSV to XML with header and line item level data. Below is the flat file format;

Header, Name, Date, Total 
Item, A, Date, Item #, Location, value 

Item, B, Date, Item #, Location, value 
Item, C, Date, Item #, Location, value 

"Header" & "item" are record type indicators.The "Header" should always be the first line and only appear once.

I'm facing errors when trying to build an XML profile and schema. Looks like the difference in fields numbers header (4), vs Items (20+) is causing issues as well 

The desired output is below

<root>

<Header>
<Name>
<date>
<total>
</Header>

<Item>
<A>
<date>
<location>
<value>
</Item>

<Item>

etc....

I am new in this. Can you people show some light? Thanks in advance! :)
 Sandra Rossi Thank you for your advice. :)
Hi All,
I am using below code to replace LOOP with READ statemnst as per ABAP 7.4 and 7.5 syntax, :
Here LT_STOCK table will be read every time by below key : WH = LS_BIN-WH BATCH = LS_BIN-BATCH
Instead, is there any way to get LT_STOCK contents in work-area LS_STOCK and use it for mapping. 
We can use FOR LOOP twice and achieve it but it does not give readability as LT_STOCK will always have
1 record for key WH and Batch. IF use 2 FOR LOOPS it gives impression that it is conventional LOOP within LOOP scenario rather than READ within LOOP.
Kindly suggest. 
DATA(LT_FINAL) = VALUE TT_FINAL( FOR LS_BIN IN LT_BINS     ( MATERIAL   = LT_STOCK[ WH = LS_BIN-WH BATCH = LS_BIN-BATCH ]-MATERIAL  
       STOCK_TYPE = LT_STOCK[ WH = LS_BIN-WH BATCH = LS_BIN-BATCH ]-STOCK_TYPE
       QUANTITY   = LT_STOCK[ WH = LS_BIN-WH BATCH = LS_BIN-BATCH ]-QUANTITY
       UNIT       = LT_STOCK[ WH = LS_BIN-WH BATCH = LS_BIN-BATCH ]-UNIT     ) ).
Hi Snehal,
You can use LET after the for loop to read the record. Please see the below example.
Thanks,

Hello all,
I thought this would help:
"SAP CRM (Customer Relationship Management) On-Premise and SAP Cloud for Customer (C4C) are two different customer relationship management solutions offered by SAP. Here are some of the key differences between them:
Deployment: SAP CRM On-Premise is installed on the customer's own servers and is maintained by their IT department. In contrast, SAP C4C is a cloud-based solution that is hosted on SAP's servers and is accessed over the internet.
Cost: SAP CRM On-Premise requires a large upfront investment in hardware, software, and IT resources for installation, customization, and maintenance. On the other hand, SAP C4C is a subscription-based service that has a lower total cost of ownership, as it eliminates the need for hardware, software, and IT resources.
Functionality: SAP CRM On-Premise is a more comprehensive solution that offers a wider range of functionality, including sales, marketing, and service management, as well as industry-specific features. SAP C4C, on the other hand, is a more focused solution that is designed specifically for sales and service management.
Integration: SAP CRM On-Premise has the advantage of being able to integrate with a wider range of on-premise and cloud-based systems. In contrast, SAP C4C is optimized for integration with other SAP cloud solutions, although it can also integrate with other systems using web services and APIs.
Mobility: SAP C4C is designed with mobile access in mind, and provides a mobile app for accessing customer information on-the-go. SAP CRM On-Premise, however, does not offer a dedicated mobile app and requires additional customization to enable mobile access.
Overall, SAP C4C is a more modern, cloud-based solution that is well-suited for sales and service management, while SAP CRM On-Premise is a more comprehensive solution with a wider range of functionality, but requires a larger investment in hardware, software, and IT resources."

I created a workflow for sales request, and set up e-mail notifications according to this guide: https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/7b24a64d9d0941bda1afa753263d9e39/924122abb4b8498b8466cc3a5a66f9ef.html?locale=en-US
I copied the sales approval e-mail as indicated in the help from SD_SLS_QTN_APPROVAL_EMAIL_TMPL and named it 02000447_CRT_ALL . Receiving the email works, however the language is always EN, not German as requested. The template already contains the right translation, also the language of both users (and connected business partner accounts) is set to German. I also copied the notification when a workflow is approved (SD_SLS_QTN_RELEASE_EMAIL_TMPL) and here it works, the mails I receive are in German. I checked table SWWWIHEAD, the language is also German. I tried copying from another e-mail template with the same result. Did anybody experience the same problem? 
I finally found the problem, in additionally to setting the language in in SU01 and in BP, you have to set the language in the address tab under "company". Only then the correct language will be used.
Hi Norbert, 
There are a few different languages configurable in SU01 - this leads to confusion sometimes. Please check in tab "Address" the field (Person)->Language. This one should show German for the users in question. We do not take into account the default logon language. If this is correctly configured, on which release is your system?

What is the process for bulk posting of a material?
In SAP-HCM an employee changed company code, and a new personnel number was created, and a new central person number. This was then adjusted manually in SAP-HCM.
In the meantime however this information was replicated to Success Factors! We now have 2 profiles in SF for the same person, which cannot be merged or deleted!
Dear SAP Users,
have you already done in practise integration between Service Cloud (C4C) and Field Service Management (former Coresystems) with Cloud Platform Integration ? Do you have some instruction manual ? This provided by SAP is not very clear for me. Thank you !

Hi,
I am using the SAP BTP ABAP cloud application jobs and logs and this works fine.
But I noticed something 'weird'.
If an application logs contains an 'error' then the application job log has an error button. Nice. 
Now you would assume the same would happen for a 'succes' entry but unfortunately not .. it is just shown as 'information' (grey). I am using 'succes' to make a distinction between jobs that have actually 'done some business logic' and jobs that didn't do anything. 


Why is the last 'success' entry not resulting in a green button while a last 'error' entry does ?
Thanks,
Steven
Hi,
the logic behind that is: the button shows the color of the most serious message type included in the whole log. This means success is only shown if ALL included messages are green. 
The framework does not know how important the content of a single message is. An info type might be of no matter, but it also might be of interest. Therefore we decided to implement the more stronger version.
Kind regards
Michael 
Hello,
I get an authentication failure when trying to login with cf:
{"error":"invalid_grant","error_description":"User authentication failed: PASSWORD_LOCKED"}

 (To me the mention of a grant and a locked password seems to indicate an administrative issue)
With credentials: I get the above error.
With SSO: I get the error "Sorry, we could not authenticate you. Try again." on the identity provider login page (https://accounts.sap.com/saml2/idp/sso...).
I also get the error "Authentication failed. " when trying to login to Cloud Foundry from BAS.
I am able to obtain a working SSO token from to the general domain (https://api.cf.us10.hana.ondemand.com)
but not from my endpoint (https://api.cf.us10-001.hana.ondemand.com)
cf version 6.53.0+8e2b70a4a.2020-10-01 on Ubuntu
Do I have to configure something? Can anybody help or do you need further info?
Thomas Robertz
can you try this way
Update:
I still couldn't get it to work.
Also I tried changing my password.
That didn't work either, I get a similar message to above.
To make sure that I didn't enter a wrong password I tried it 3 times now my password seems to be locked for good.
Is there any support besides this forum where I can get my password reset/unlocked and also get the above issur resolved?
Thanks

I'm wondering if it's possible to automate logging in and using the 'save data to' button through vba on the ByDesign add-in. I'm trying to automate sales orders from customers.
Hi Jordy Dominguez,
Can you brief more ?

Gibt es noch keine Lösung?
Ich suche fast dasselbe. Ich möchte, dass in einem Excel eingebundene ByDesign Reports automatisch aktualisiert werden, dazu muss sich aber nach dem Öffnen erst ein User anmelden.
Kann man die Anmeldung mit VBA o.ä. automatisieren (Makros mit Aktionen im SAP Add-in werden nicht aufgezeichnet)?
Es soll letztlich erreicht werden, dass das Excel von einem cronjob geöffnet wird, alle SAP Reports aktualisiert werden und es wieder geschlossen wird.

SAP C/4HANA Service Cloud?

Based on the current public Road Map SAP C/4HANA Service Cloud consists of the following ares: 1. SAP Customer Service Management <br>2. SAP Customer Engagement Center<br>3.SAP Field Service Management.

We have implemented SAP Cloud for Customer-Service in different Szenarios.
Some of our Customers are using SAP Cloud for Customer to cretate Tickets,
which is a functionality of "SAP Customer Service Management".Our Customers also using it to have an overview of the Service-Activities like Calls,Tickets,Emails and using it also as single point of entry to contact the Service-Agent.Both functionalities are also availabale in SAP Customer Engagement Center.
I am also not able to find any learning material regarding the SAP C/4HANA Service Cloudon the SAP Leanring Hub. I can only see learning material regaridng SAP Cloud for Customer. Question 2: What can I recommend now to my customers to use in the following scenarios:
Scenario 1. Customer has SAP Cloud for Customer - Sales running. Now he want to use Service-functionalities like tickets. 
Scenario 2. Customer has nothing and want to implement a new Service-Solution from scrach 
including Tickets, Customer Engagment Center, Field Service functionalities.Many thanks in advance for your answers.

Hallo,
im Zuge einer Datenmigration von IS-U nach IS-U sollen u.a. Geräteinfosätze übernommen werden. Der Kunde möchte allerdings, dass die seinerzeit im Altsystem vergebenen Equipmentnummern bei den Geräteinfosätzen 1:1 übernommen werden. Mir ist nur bekannt, dass bei Geräteinfosätzen die Equipmentnummer immer nur intern (also vom System) vergeben wird. Irre ich mich da oder gibt es doch eine Möglichkeit bei Geräteinfosätzen eine externe Equipmentnummer mitzugeben?
Dear SAC Expert,
Is it possible to restrict model access for an user with Planning Professional license? We have a Planning Finance Admin user which should only has full access to Finance model but no any access to HR model. We tried to create a custom role under Planning Professional and limit the model access to only Finance Model but the user still able to access to HR model via public files. We didn't even share the folder access to the user. Kindly advise how we can design the data access control to limit this planning professional user from accessing HR model?
Custom Planning Professional Role

We only provide Full Access to Finance Model but not HR model

Thank you!
Best Regards,
Yanice
Access rights to a model is a combination of roles and share rights.
I'm not sure what you mean by "full access" here, but check the share rights on the model or the folder the model is in (if you have several HR models you want to limit) and make sure that the user or team(s) they belong to have only "view" rights on the model if you want them to be able to view but not modify the model.

Hello,
 How multiple end users can access attended BOT? What login credentials do they need to connect Desktop Agent with Tenant?
Only Build Automation service is required and not workflow management.
Regards,
NS
That is good to know Nilesh, please select the correct answer and close the issue. Regards,Archana
Hello Nilesh,
Yes, to access the Bot in attended mode - a Desktop agent is needed. For having automation Bot in your landscape - only SAP Build Process Automation service is needed (note: workflow management is the old service name which is now deprecated)
Hi,For attended use the users desktops would need the desktop agent installed and connecting to SAP build service url tenant url, which is provided from the Cloud factory (copyand paste).Switching the desktop agent to attended mode also a requirement.https://help.sap.com/docs/IRPA/6b9c8e86a0be43539b670de962834562/84089a65b7274effb907df3dc54ab3e1.html
Then enter their email address that you would also add to the BTP subaccount hosting the service.Within SAP BTP, they may need specific role collections or try the roles collections already created from when the service is activated.
If there are mulitple users per operating system, then each logon would need to be connected. I have not looked at deployment options for the Desktop Agent, but that maybe possible instead of manually configuring multiple sessions.
I have also used MS RDS to host multiple logins to SAP iRPA and this works well, but you may need to solve auto logoff if you ever want to use unattended bots in this architecture.
Thanks,
Daren
Hi Nilesh,If I understand your question correctly, you are looking to understand how the users get created?In SAP BTP, it is possible to integrate SAP Identity Authentication Service / SAP Identity Provisioning Services to manage a larger number of users. This service can connect to other identity providers (e.g. MS Azure - other providers too) as well as SAP iDP. This could create users in BTP for you (I beleive) I have not completed this integration personally, but was the direction I was looking at. But I do not know if there is a method to automate the users device to connect their email to the iRPA service. Maybe via app deployment tooling?But if your requirement was just 10 users, then create 10 S-User IDs in the SAP customer number to which your BTP account is registered. The email addresses should also added to the BTP subaccount that is hosting the SAP Build Process Automation service.Once roles are provided, then each user will need to register their Desktop Agent with their credentials in the Cloud factory. This should allow them to synchronise and select the automation required to be triggered.
Let me know if I have not properly understood the details.Regards,
Daren
Hello Nilesh,
It depends upon the user management policy in your company. The BTP account trust configuration have to be setup based on your company's policy. As Daren mentioned, you can use IAS as well or default service provider of SAP BTP. You may want to contact your account administrator for the setup. 
In simple term, for any user to login to SAP BTP account he would be needing a user account which is an S-user or P-user account. For that, they have to register in BTP and would be given user name or password - or the users might be already registered. The same username and password have to be used while tenant setup in Desktop Agent. You can read more on User Management here and other security aspects here.
Hope that clarifies,Archana

Hello,
we are intensely prototyping gCTS to learn about the pros and cons and especially the differences to abapGIT. Also very familiar with the non-ABAP world.
One outcome is, that gCTS behaves very obstinately when it recognizes only portions of an object to be registered by a transport. As an example: only a method has been tracked by the transport, but not the hole class. This situation is quite normal, when code exists, and developers do maintenance only. gCTS stops then committing this transport. Sounds safe-guarding, but in fact it produces a lot of efforts and down sides.
Solution now would be, add the underling code base to the repro by a transport, then each delta will be handled correct by gCTS.
But think twice, it will mean, that at the end nearby the hole code base, including SAP and 3rd party code need to be added. And all this manually, by someone.
Is this the concept?
Better way would be to improve gCTS, like adding missing parts of an object automatically. Sure, this way you do not get the complete code base under GIT control, but this is not the target.
Target is, to get all transports committed smoothly without user interaction.
What do you think?
There would be more to say, about how the GIT concept has been transferred to the ABAP world, but this will be another story. :-)
Many thanks.
Hello Marko,
it is necessary to understand that with a git repository you maintain versions of a software component (in a wider sense, so it may also be only a package or a small set of packages). So it is obvious that you start with gCTS by committing the complete software component to the git repository, before you start committing changes. This is what we also recommend: https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/d7ffc00f4f304f4a9e7a13a09878980d.html
After having committed an initial version of your software component to the repository, you can commit any change, also changes on partial objects, using the transport requests where the changed objects are recorded with.
The idea that you intend to store only software deltas (or deltas on table entries) as of a certain point in time shows that you see the git repository only as a technical substitution for the transport directory. But this is not the intention of gCTS.
Here we describe how an initial commit can be done: https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM_NEW/4a368c163b08418890a406d413933ba7/bb01f567bd5344ffb627f7cd432a433f.html
So as as summary, this is what you should always keep in mind: Commits are no delta transports, they are versions of a software component. Even if we still use transport requests to records changes ...
BTW: in our trouble shooting guide, we refer to the "partial objects" issue:https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/2504/actions/34024:53612:53614:45356

Hi,Please help to explain how does this checked credit value field being calculated.In the DCD the Open Credit Amount shows higher value than Checked Credit ValueThanks.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
Hello, The display of the documented credit decision (transaction UKM_CASE) contains the fields "Open Credit Amount" (UKM_DCD_ATTR-DCD_OPENCRDTAMT) and "Checked Credit Value" (UKM_DCD_ATTR-DCD_CHKDRISKAMT).
The open credit amount displays the total value of the document from the credit view.
The Checked Credit Value displays the value of the document at the time of the credit check. Specifies the value checked by the system during the latest credit check with regard to the credit risk. If the document was credit blocked during creation and still remains credit blocked during sales document changes (without ever releasing the document), then the same DCD will be used to log details. This Checked Credit Value can vary widely, depending on the status of the sales document at the time of the credit check. Example scenarios:The availability check might only be able to confirm half the quantity, with the result that the checked credit value in the documented credit decision is only half as much as the open credit amount. Other example scenario:1. A credit analyst enters a new order with a value of EUR 100. Following the related credit check, the system enters the value 100 in this field.2. As the customer has reduced his order by EUR 10, the credit analyst also makes this change in the system. Following the related credit check, the system enters - 10 (minus 10) in this field.3. If the credit analyst checks the order again later without making any changes, the system enters the value 0 (zero) in this field. Best regards,EdinaSAP
Hi,
I want to picking for “Goods Issue” with the “Outbound Delivery Document”. I want to do a verification of what materials were picked. How will the materials collected on the basis of "Outbound Delivery Document" be physically separated?
If you have any idea/suggestion please let me know. Thank you.
Hi Sercan,
You can issue Delivery outputs and paste the physical copy to the material picked.
Best Regards
Akshay Kahare
Hi  Sercan Uzun - Can you please elaborate your question. You want system to verify that the right material has been physically picked against your outbound delivery? A little more explanation may help.
Junaid
Hi Sercan Uzun,
Hope you checked Scope Item 3BS, Check the test script attached in the Scope item and refer steps 4.2 to 4.10.
There are options of 
Create Pick WH Task > Confirm Task once picked > Pack Goods (Consider Staging Bin as your Loading Area) > Print HU Label > Print Delivery Note > Print loading Instructions (Check for correct Items picked) >PGI
Try to transfer stock at different location physically after picking and take leverage of print options for checking correctness of material while loading.
Best Regards

Hello Experts, i would like to call a Tcode Z0AVW and there u can but the documentno and itemno 
it works but it only jumps into documentno wihtout the item so i have to manuelly looking for the itme number.
this is my code:
SET PARAMETER ID 'AUN' FIELD object-key-salesdocumentno.  <br>SET PARAMETER ID 'APO' FIELD object-key-itemno.<br>
CALL TRANSACTION 'Z0AVW' WITH AUTHORITY-CHECK AND SKIP FIRST SCREEN.
As it's a customer (namespace) transaction, you have to locally analyze how the associated program handle parameter-ids (defined in initial dynpro or read in some report event such as INITIALIZATION)
For efficiency improvements and finiancial monitoring business wants to create a common code with Kcal/kg UoM for multiple fuels being used with different unit of measure. Since SAP doesnt allow 309 movement for material with different UoM, what ways can be used to transfer the componant material stock to Common material code stock?
Hello https://people.sap.com/shubham1607,
In this case you can consume your material to cost centre with movement type 201 or 551 and produce your stock with movement type 501 or 521 
OR
Create a another type of process order and in this process order you can consume or receive your material.

Hi, we've been working on a C4C solution and and we created an HTML Mashup in in SAP Cloud Application Studio. 
We need to prevent our HTML Mashup from reloading on every opening and SAP suggested that we change the facet id to contain "$Mashup..." (that is put $Mashup in the Navigation Item ID). 
We checked on our solution but we can find the way to put this value ($Mashup) on our HTML Mashup. 
Does anybody know how to do it?
Thanks,
Omar
Dear Omar,
Looks like that is outdated information. Currently, Mashup no-reload feature is only applicable to TI's where mashup is embedded on the facet of TI. For all other places, it will refresh. 
Also "No reload" feature is not supported for the Mashup which is added via SAP Cloud Application Studio. This feature is only supported for mashup added via Adaptation mode.
Hope this answers your query.
Thanks,
Dhanya KV
Follow up query - I have a mashup in an embedded component in an extension tab on COD_SR_TI, that I really want to be able to control the refresh of. When parameters outside the mashup change, the mashup is not notified of the change and is out of date. In my case I am passing the ticket categorization to the mashup.
So, is the "no-reload feature is only applicable to TI's" configurable or manageable? Any suggestion greatfully received

We have configured the SOAP receiver adapter and trying to send the payload. But getting error as connection refused. We are using basic authentication, and using the WSDL provided from S4 Hana.

Do we need to allow the CPI tenant ip at the S4 Hana side? If yes, how to get the tenant ip? Also, is there any other set up that we are missing ?
Regards,
P Kumar
Dear Kumar,
I have a questions for you:
Did you expose your S4H on SAP BTP using destinations or expose your service using Web dispatcher?
Regards, 
Is this S4 HANA or S4 HANA Cloud?

Hi Experts,
What happens if we set rows per commit to 1milion?wil it effect the performance?does it work really??
Dear Experts,
We have a delivery with 2 quantity with 2 different serial numbers. But while doing PGI by VL02N we want to create two separate material documents for each quantity. We dont want to split delivery line item into 2 line item.
When final goods movement happens , we need to do goods movement for each qty separately.
Will that be possible by an ABAP enhancement ? 
I couldn't find any suitable answer while searching. Please guide. 
Thanks in Advance!
Regards, 
AFAIK standard system always creates goods issue documents for outbound deliveries as 1:1. 
Although the database tables structures suggest that 1:N relationship could be possible too, the application does not take such scenario into account at all. It just always wants to create one single material document covering the whole delivery - and as I have found out, what is even worse: the system does not offer any enhancement which could allow to safely switch that logic to "1:N mode".
But the good news is: you can try a workaround of splitting the outbound delivery document itself - into two or more delivery documents (before PGI) - and then perform PGI for all these resulting deliveries (check tcodes: VLSP / VLSPS). 
regards
Try creating two Transfer Orders so that you might get two material documents after posting the goods issue for one delivery

Hello All,
I am trying to look for an event to call a macro when a user inserts /removes new characteristics in columns in AFO workbook. I have tried counting number of columns in a cell and try to use the worksheet_calculate event on cell change due to formula but it doesn't seem to work. I have also tried the API call back Callback_AfterRedisplay() but this too is not helping much. Is there any event that can be used.
Thanks in advance
Nikhil

Nikhil AnandUnfortunately, there is no built-in event for when a user inserts or removes columns in an AFO workbook. You will need to create your own custom solution to detect and respond to changes in the columns. One approach you could use is to track changes in the column count using the workbook_calculate event. You can compare the column count before and after the event to determine if any columns were added or removed. Another approach would be to use the API callback Callback_AfterRedisplay() to detect changes in the column count. This API callback will be triggered whenever the AFO window is refreshed, which should occur when columns are added or removed. You can then compare the column count before and after the callback to determine if any columns were added or removed.
Hi All
Any idea is any Active System Alert or customized Query Alert in Alert Management create notification message on Mobile Handphone without user logging into SAP Business One on Mobile Device?
Kedalene Chong
Dear Kedalene Chong,
If the client is willing to spend, you can customize and integrate with SMS subscription from third party service provider.
Thank You.
Its not a standard feature, usully I email the alerts to the relevant user so they do not need to login to SAP B1 mobile app. 
Dear All,

Dear SAP Community,
How is it possible to exclude a material from Intrastat Declaration (both sales and purchase side)?

Hi CAP-Team,
although this topic was discussed a few times in the SCN, for example here, here and here, I could not find any complete guidance on it. As far as I could see, there are two related chapters in the CAP docs:
Destinations and Multitenancy
SaaS Service Dependencies

But from my point of view, they are missing a few steps or a complete example. I got it working by manually implementing the dependency callback handler (but I'm not even sure, if this is the recommended way.) and thanks to Gregor Wolf, checking this blog post and using some lines from the Susaas example (here and here). 
Is there any other documentation I missed? If yes, it should be linked to the mentioned places.If not, it would be helpful if the documentation could be enhanced about how to inject dependencies when using multitenancy.
Thanks & Regards
Nico

Need your expertise for the following case.
If the user is on site and browsing, and then leaves the device as such at that stage (session remaining idle) for say a couple of ours.
When user returns and tries to continue the joursey from same point where he left, if any API call is made at that point it returns 405
Example, user opened login page.
He leaves the device. Returns after an hur and gives credential on same opened page.
The login API gives 405.
The sessionfaillback has been enabled .

Hello,Thanks for the API reference. The get calls are working fine but wherever there is PUT/POST/PATCH call, it requires csrf token. So I was following below blog to fetch csrf token but the value I get is "deprecated". Please let me know how to fetch CSRF token.https://blogs.sap.com/2018/11/22/sap-landscape-management-lama-rest-api-testing/PFA: CSRF.jpgThanks
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.

Hello
thank you for the details.
According to the blog at section "2. First let’s get the X-CSRF-Token" as of LaMa API version 3.0.9.0 or later you will get the value of x-csrf-token as deprecated:
==================
2. First let’s get the X-CSRF-Token
We will collect cookie information in the file cookiejar.dat which we will use in the subsequent call to perform an update.
PLEASE NOTE: As of LaMa API version 3.0.9.0 “GET /xsrftoken” method is deprecated. If you have this version or later you will get the value of x-csrf-token as deprecated. You will however, still need to include the token in the header (without a value or any value as it will be ignored) when performing the PATCH operation below.
3. Run the command
curl --user Administrator --header "X-CSRF-Token: Fetch" --cookie-jar cookiejar.dat --verbose http://<LaMa IP address>:50000/lama-api/xsrftoken 
4. Since we used the “–verbose” flag we will see the token value displayed in the output. Copy the token value to your clipboard for use in the next step.
“< x-csrf-token: ZTOsMK5wwj_3Mp6IpR5oqYOgV869lDgYRgA”
“< x-csrf-token: deprecated” — for LaMa API version 3.0.9.0 or later
5. Assign the token value to a variable for ease. In case of LaMa API version 3.0.9.0 or later assign the value ‘deprecated’
==================
I guess your LaMa API version is "3.0.9.0" or later and in that case the value "deprecated" is normal.

Hey guys,
I have a simple table in a SAC report based on a dataset, which I created from an uploaded CSV file. In this table I have five columns with calculated measures. 

Four of them are restricted measures, which displays the measures for a specific time period. 
The fifth column is a calculated measure, which compares two of the periods.
The rows are showing the Product dimension. 

So far so good. Now I want to add a new row at the end to sum up all values. For the first four columns, this works pretty well, but when it comes to the comparison column, it seems that the calculation for the comparison is ignored and instead the sum calculation overrules the comparison.
So my question is: Can I somehow change this behavior, so that in all cells of the sum row, the sum aggregation should stay but only in the comparison cell, the comparison should still work.
Please take a look at the picture below. The last row is the sum row and the last cell shows a value of 820%, which is wrong, because it is the result of summing up all above percentages.

Best regards
Dominik
Hi Dominik Espitalier, 
  Not sure how you created sum row, but maybe you can try with option 'Intersecting calcualtion priority' at the bottom of table designre panel. 
Best regards, William

Variable2 got parsed but while pulling the variable into the table it shows blank data in the cells i have tried every possible way like splitted the formula but when using current year () in variable2 it is giving values but when using reportingdate-2 its not giving values. 
Can anyone please suggest a suitable solution for this.
If possible share with some sample data
You can try with  using some dimension object in Variable1.

Hi everybody,

Can I get a sample code to save the long text 
(text from the text editor) into ztable.

Pl.help.

thanks 
regards
manicveera
Veera,

Long texts cannot be stored in a Z Table. You should use a key to store them using SAVE_TEXT function module.

For TDOBJECT, TDNAME and TDID you can TEXT, whatever object you are dealing with and ST respectively. If you can explain in detail, what exactly you are tyring to do, we can probably give you a solution.

Look at the way how texts are stored for PO or for any other document. You can go into text editor and look at the header for the parameter details.

Regards,
Ravi

Note : please mark the helpful answers.


Message was edited by: Ravikumar Allampallam

Hi manicveera

 You cant save the Long text throug SAP Script Editor in ztables. You can create Text Objects statically through transcation- SO10 or create dynamically by using Script function READ_TEXT,WRITE_TEXT and INIT_TEXT. Now you can store in ztable the object, and TextID so that you can read long text in future.

If any problem presits, Feel Free to mail me at varun_sanghi@jspl.com

Hi there,
It looks like you are using a self signed certificate that is using a certificate authority that is not trusted in your operating system. As suggested previously, could you please review the comments in https://help.sap.com/viewer/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/Latest/en-US/4b318bede7eb4021a8be385c46c74045.html and see if that helps?

Dear Expert,
We are using latest version of SAP B1 Intercompany add-on.
While we are updating the Sales Order like from Pending to Accept that time Purchase Order also should be changed from Pending to Accept but its not updating and when I check on Monitor status and found out that Transaction has been failed. 
On the Transaction log file or xml file I found out that <Document_Lines> section has been empty.
I am not able find out the root cause because packages are encrypted so not able to find out that why <Document_Lines> section is empty for Sales Order to Purchase Order transaction.

Hi Experts
We are trying to exporting SAC Plan data to Custom field of ACDOCP, S/4HANA.
So, we followed the guide below. (Register API service, Extending CDS View, field, re-load meta data etc.)
https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3120758
(Extensibility Option for CO-PA fields in S/4HANA Finance Planning)
but we have two problems
1. Validation Check
We are going to export plan data (contains master data that doesn't exist in S/4 HANA) to
ZZ_Product Category (Custom field of ACDOCP), Casue S/4 HANA teams want to have that master data and Transaction data, and it should be repeadted with schedule job.
But we failed to export. ( 404 error, "Resource not found for the segment "ZZ_Product Category")
I think it means the table should have master data already.
Cannot bypass validation check?
2. Length
We want the length of Members of ZZ_Product Category more than 30
but, the field have 11 length fixed.
How can i edit it? Can it by eclipse?
Dear Dongun Kang,
if you want to plan data in SAC and afterwards do the writeback to S/4HANA, we strongly recommend to first import master data from your S/4HANA system before you start to plan.
If you're unclear about importing data to your model, please have a look at the info in the SAP Help portal, Import Data to Your Model.
In case you need to export your plan data without performing the master data import first, you need to filter your export job to only export records with master data which is existing in S/4HANA system.
It's not possible to to bypass the validation checks.
Moreover the error message (404 error, "Resource not found for the segment "ZZ_Product Category") indicates that, after modifying the OData service, it might not be updated properly in the backend.
Please follow the instructions in KBA 2743849 and let me know if this solves the error 404.
Regarding your second question:You can either change the length of your custom field in your S/4HANA system using transaction SE11 or in eclipse.
Best regardsSusanne

Hi experts, I've recently started working on SAP MDK platform. Currently, we're working on a project where design of Mobile app is already designed on Adobe XD software. They have shared the development link to us. We want to use their design and develop an app on SAP MDK platform(eg: Implementing the logics and services). I want to know how can we import that design in SAP MDK and start working on development. or any alternatives that we can use.
Amit Kumbar
There is currently no support available for importing a design file into the MDK editor. 
To develop an MDK application, you can use the visual editor available in SAP Business Application Studio (BAS) which allows you to drag & drop UI controls to mock up app screens, there are also templates available to create project and add other related artifacts. 
I would suggest you to try out our MDK developer tutorial series (in same order as listed) if not done before starting on MDK development.

I am facing issue post transportation from DEV to Quality in one of the transformation as described below: Please help me with this if any solution, thanks
BW/4HANA Transformation Formula displays with String Error in Quality system (QBW) whereas in Dev system it looks fine. The word 'String' gets added additionally to the formula in Quality system thus its causing issue.
Note: There is no error when checking in DEV system (DBW 100). While transporting to Quality (QBW), it is not throwing any error but when we perform check in Quality, it shows an error ''Rule (target field: <filed name> group: 01 Standard Group): Formula is empty''.

Hi,
I have a GL where there are many transaction in different FX currencies going through the year. At the end of each year the GL is cleared down to nil in document currency by way of summing to nil. And then the local currency is cleared through the F-03 function. So then at year end, the entire account is nil and closed.
I am currently being audited and they have sampled a couple of the F-03 journals that were posted, however I am unable to work out how to recalculate it from start to finish.
Because it is not a simple one to one relationship in this GL, it is over the whole year, I cannot seem to work out how F-03 aggregates and calculates the journals to make.
From looking at the postings, there are multiple postings in say the USD currency, and they are at varying different FX rates that I think are a blended mixed rate of some kind?
In the end, I want to be ale to recalculate any F-03 resultant line item, by using the data from the GL in the year. Can someone please provide me with the intricate details/is there a manual as to how it is calculated?
Thank you,
Hi  Ronald Yap 
I am not sure, if you can get all the details you need. Assuming you are on ECC, you might get details of all the documents cleared with reference to a clearing document through BSAS table. You can than have a look at the documents cleared and analyze the business rationle for the same. If you are an end user, you can get the required info with the help of an IT Colleague. However, there is system report to tell why document(s) were cleared using a specific clearing document, since that is a business decision, when the documents were cleared in the first place

Hi all,
We need to create a new wage type that should go under IT0014. The WT is already created in EC. But when we replicate to SAP On-Prem (HCM), we get an error "Entry 0008 ** **** does not exist in T512Z (check entry). Not sure why it has IT 0008 as we need this under IT0014. Table T512Z is populated with the wage type with INFTY = 0014. Any idea what are we missing?
thanks
Jenn
Hi Jennifer,You need to exclude this wage type from the template in the business integration builder that is used for replicating it0008 and add it to the clone template for replicating IT0014.If you do not know how to do this, please get in touch with me. Best regards,Marco
Hi Jennfier,
check the table "T77SFEC_WT_PROC", the WT entry must be removed from IT0008 and created for IT0014.

Hi All,
My requirement is to have GRC integrated with Service Now for creation of access requests for Contractors.
There are many threads on this req. But none has been answered. Could you please suggest here.
Regards
Plaban
Hi Plaban.
Can you please clarify if you want ServiceNow to automatically create access requests in GRC or if you want GRC to provision access in ServiceNow?
Both cases are possible and will require some development. Knowing which one you want I can give you some ideas about how to do it.
Regards,
Marcelo
Hi Marcelo, 
Can you please to provide some documentation on Service now to automatically create access request in GRC 12.
Regards,
Ar
Hi Plaban and Arunachalam.
I haven't done the integration specifically with ServiceNow, but with other non-SAP systems. Both to onboard systems for access provisioning (when GRC triggers the call to these system, usually via their APIs) or to allow these systems to call GRC services you will need a bit of development.
I have done a similar integration to this one you need for ServiceNow, allowing another solution to create access requests by developing some oData services in GRC Access Control. They are exposed in the SAP Gateway (hosted in GRC itself and republished in SAP BTP), and end up calling the IDM integration API in GRC right behind my custom code. 
Despite having not worked with the ServiceNow API, I know it is very rich and has a lot of inbound and outbound services. In the suggestion above I'm supposing that these outbound services can be used to call services exposed in GRC after you have your approvals there.
But if not, there would be another (not so pretty option), which would be to achieve this by scheduling a recurrent job in GRC (each 5 or 10 minutes, for example) to call ServiceNow inbound API (which is even richer than the outbound one) to retrieve the info about what was requested and approved there.
I hope this general overview and suggestions cal help you.

Hi,
When we use Default Route Stage Type 05 for International Scenario, stages are determining in Freight Unit as Not relevant for Planning in Development system but not in Quality system.
Can you please share your suggestions.

Dear Experts,
Can we connect EHP4 FOR SAP ERP 6.0(Oracle DB) on premise system with SAP DWC and use extractors for data modeling in DWC.
If there is a documentation available please share.
Thanks
Best Regards
Poshan
Hi Poshan,
Please check the First Guidance: Data Integration for ABAP Source Systems.
Regards,Dominik
Thanks Dominik. I believe best possible option for now is BW Bridge for BW customers, S/4 HANA for ECC customers for a decent connectivity and data replication to target DWC.

各位专家，
有没有相关的案例分享？是不是直接对接，不用走第三方平台了？？
目前中国本地化功能还不支持电子发票的接口
Hello,
Is there a need of SAP BW Bridge in Data Warehouse Cloud to perform data extraction/modeling with source as SAP ECC (ERP 6.0) 
Based on SAP content, for BW 7.3 above conversions/migrations only BW bridge is required. 
If there is no BW system in the existing landscape can we connect ECC with DWC for similar BW like modeling. 
Main idea is to use SAP extractors to bring data from ECC to DWC with deltas(ODP) and perform data modeling in core SAP DWC.
Thanks
Poshan
Hi Poshan,You can connect SAP Data Warehouse Cloud to SAP ECC without the need of the BW Bridge, but it can be used.It's important to understand that the BW Bridge is a feature which delivers BW/4HANA based functionalities as part of Data Warehouse Cloud. When the BW Bridge is setup, a dedicated space is foreseen which runs on an ABAP Runtime Environment. BW Bridge can be used to mitigate the transition from BW to Data Warehouse Cloud, so existing BW models can be reused in SAP DWC.Yet BW Bridge should not necessarily be used as an 'extension' of BW. You can have BW features in SAP Data Warehouse Cloud without an on-premise BW system.When you specifically want to make use of BW capabilities in Data Warehouse Cloud, I would say BW Bridge is the 'way to go'. Otherwise you can also make use of the dedicated SAP DWC functionalities such as graphical views, data flows,...I hope this gives an answer to your question. If you have further questions don't hesitate to contact me.Kind regards,Bert BaeckelmansAnalytics Consultant | Cubis Belgium 
Hi Poshan, hi Bert,
When connecting extractors directly to SAP Data Warehouse Cloud, you should consider the guidelines described in the First Guidance: Data Integration for ABAP Source Systems and the answer given by Deniz Osoy in a comment under his blog on SAP BW bridge.
Regards,Dominik
Thanks Bret & Dominik.
I went through Deniz blog. It was detailed enough. I believe still data extraction with abap extractors with delta functionality is not an option with core DWC.

S4HC专家你好，我们项目启用原因代码出具现金流量表，但是银行存款外币评估功能自动生成的会计凭证不能修改也不能带出原因代码，并且在自定义逻辑里也没办法做增强（输出字段没有原因代码这个字段），请问如何能够解决这个问题？
你好，现金流量表的出具有标准的APP，reason code不是标准做法。所以请考虑用Cloud标准功能出具现金流量表。
请问，您用的是直接法还是间接法？
Dear Gary，
我面临的问题是使用标准的APP直接法出局现金流量表的时候，
例如 借方 银行科目，，贷方 客户（应收款） -统驭科目， 这种情况下 银行的 借方金额是没有办法取到数，只有，贷方科目也为总账科目1122*的时候，这个情况可以取到数据，，配置里也没关于客户D 类型的设置？？
即使使用原因代码出具现金流量表，外币评估的凭证也不需要分配给原因代码。
这部分是汇率变动对现金及现金等价物的净增加额
看财务凭证，外币评估收益/损失的发生额就可以了

39913000（初始 FI-AM 抵销），如果在系统上线之后第二次导入数据使用了该科目，会导致资产负债表中”计算的损失“在下年有年初余额吗？

资产负债表中”计算的损失“ 是计算的结果。不存在余额结转的概念。
而这个科目本身是资产负债表科目，科目的年末余额会结转到下一年的年初余额。
I'm just wondering why europe1 extension has such name. I haven't found any explanation on wiki and I've also tried to google it, but it hasn't helped me. May be I wasn't too observant.
Thanks. 
Definitely a legacy name.
Probably had a plan to have multiple price factories depending on regional differences but that never happened and the name stuck. 
Well, we started out with the idea of having a PriceFactory interface in order to allow many alternative implementations.
Then we did a first one that should fit well for retail in most of europe and named it 'europe1'. 
After that it turned out that implementing more and different ones wasn't really necessary because we had some good input from a partner company in the beginning so the data model turned out to be flexible enough to serve a lot of use case. ( product and customer specific, scale prices, unit specific, net / gross, time dependent, .. )
However, the actual calculation is done outside of the price factories, which is far more relevant for different regions ( e.g. taxes on delivery can be different ). So the name is even a bit misleading.

关于Group Reporting遇到存货未实现利润抵消有什么推荐的解决方案吗？非常感谢。
Hi Julia，目前而言，Group Reporting的标准功能里并没有包含存货未实现利润抵消。可以到influence portal里提建议。
谢谢Gary！在鼓励客户提交功能增强建议，同时伙伴提出建设性变通办法欢迎探讨：
1. 关联公司存货未实现利润是能按照全部金额还原成本，可将该抵消配置放在资产负债表，增加自定义抵消角色。然后存货科目维护细分类别和抵消角色即可
2. 留存的利润百分比需要手工做凭证冲回多抵消的成本。目前建议手工处理这部分凭证。
3. 建议SAP可以将这部分存货留存利润抵消参考股权百分比方式实现系统标准配置 - 鼓励客户提交功能增强申请中（Customer Influence Request）...

老师好，如果不激活33Q，原材料或者库存商品可以使用S价么？价格确定是2（基于交易的）

可以的。是遇到什么问题了吗？
在不激活Scope item 33Q和使用价格确认3的情况下。
原材料和库存商品使用S价格当然是可以的。 
但是会有原材料采购差异和产成品结算的差异，这部分差异在月结的时候需要手工财务凭证调整到存货或者主营业务成本。
Hey Guy, 
we have a "simple" question: Should fields using alpha conversion been transformed to the representation/outbound format before sending them via an bgRFC call?
Our situation: We develop a cloud application that should retrieve data from e.g. OnPremise S4/Hana systems.The data we retrieve includes fields which use a domain with alpha conversion, like order numbers etc.Since the current OnPremise logic has some problems with an automatic conversion, we started discussing if the alpha conversion (to the representation format) needs to be done before sending it to our Cloud Product or not.My Opinion:The data should use the representation/outbound format when send to an external system (our cloud product).Since the data leaves the system that uses and knows the alpha conversion setting, so the external system has hardly any way to handle it. And our user also expect that our ui works with the outbound format for displaying and filtering our entities. We could include some code that could handle the removal of, e.g. leading zeros. But we can't just apply the logic to some specific fields, since we allow our data to include customer individual fields/data.If we take a look at how we retrieve data with the default way of pulling it over the odata api, we get it with the outbound format too.What experiences have you made with the topic?Or how do you see the issue, maybe I misunderstood a few things?

Florian
Hi Everyone!
Please look at the below code. I have tried to create Physical Inventory Adjustment using ABSL.
I have tried this blog. https://archive.sap.com/discussions/message/16777316#16777316
But I'm facing the below error.

BeforeSave Script:
import ABSL;
import AP.LogisticsExecution.Global;

var createPIA : elementsof PhysicalInventoryCount;
createPIA.LocationID.content = "L1100";
createPIA.CountMethodCode = "2";
var resultPIA = PhysicalInventoryCount.Create(createPIA);

var operationalCnt = resultPIA.OperationCount.Create();
operationalCnt.PhysicalInventoryCountScopeCode = "4";

var Activity = operationalCnt.OperationActivity.Create();

var InventoryNoe = Activity.OperationActivityCountInventory.Create();
InventoryNoe.LogisticsAreaKey.ID = "L1100-30-10";
InventoryNoe.LogisticsAreaKey.SiteID.content = "L1100";
InventoryNoe.AddItem();

var inventoryItem = InventoryNoe.OperationActivityInventoryItem.Create();
inventoryItem.MainInventorySeparatingValues.MaterialKey.ProductID.content = "EMB51";

var qty = inventoryItem.OperationActivityInventoryItemQuantity.Create();
qty.ZeroCountedQuantityConfirmedIndicator = true;

Activity.EndCountActivity();

Am I Missing anything? Please help to solve this problem.

Hello all,
This is the revised code working perfectly. The bug was in the creation of OperationActivityInventoryItem and OperationActivityInventoryItemQuantity Nodes.

Hello, 
I have epmselectmember formula like this:
epmselectmember(,"ACTUAL","TYPE=''","VERSION")
The problem is in filter section, Type property = F, B or any other value works but I cant make blank work. I tried TYPE = " ", TYPE = ' ' (single or double quotations, with and without space in the middle)
Any suggestions?
Zack Smith
Unfortunately comparison with blank (' ') is not supported in EPMSelectMember. The only way I see is you populate the TYPE with 'BLANK' rather than ' ' . You can use any other attribute value for TYPE if you like but  EPMSelect will only work with some value and not blank.
Hope this helps !!

Hello Experts,
On the RF scanner when operators type in exception code BIDP (Pick Denial, Partial Quantity), SAP automatically creates a Warehouse Order, to fulfil the Pick from alternative Bin. However, this Warehouse Order appears as the last Warehouse Order on the Queue which the RF operator performing the Picking.
Is there any way to make this Warehouse Order appear as the next Warehouse Order on the 'Queue' , so that the picker can complete all the picking jobs for the same delivery?
Thanks in advance.
Hi All,
To close this thread. I have achieved the above requirement with following set up. It might have some other functionality but works well for my requirement.
SPRO Configuration:
--> Defined Mode Type (e.g. Rounded down to nearest 30 min.)
--> Defined Mode determination Criteria ( Assigned the above Mode Type for Activity 'PICK')
Maintain 'Execution Priority ' (/SCWM/EXECPR).
--> Assigned the Mode configured above with Priority parameter : 'Process Type' and weightage of '100' .
This made the substitute WT to appear as the next WT when I hit a Pick Denial exception on RF.
Thanks
Hi,
"SAP automatically creates a Warehouse Order, to fulfil the Pick from alternative Bin."
Not quite so. What the system does, is to create a new Warehouse Task. 
If there is a new warehouse order, it is depending on your warehouse order creation rules. In which sequence these are processed, depends on the latest start date (first) and priority (second).

Hi Amit,
I would suggest implementing Badi /SCWM/EX_RSRC_PROC_WO for your scenario. Check if the relevant WHO ( Task) has reference to a PDO doc. If yes, check if the status picking has started. If yes, update the latest start picking date of the WHO.

Dear SAP,One of our analysts asked this question:“When we archive purchase orders is there anyway to access the change log? We have a bunch of POs that had line items deleted on them and we want to know who did it, but they've been archived.” I tried searching table CDHDR using a PO number that she provided, but it didn't return any results.Can you let me know if this information is available (and how to access it, if possible) so I can respond to her?Thanks------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
Many thanks for the question - 
In short, no, the change logs are deleted along with additional data when the PO / Objects are archived; 
See FAQ Note 456129, Q14: 
===
14. Question:
Why does the system not write any change documents when the initial archiving run is followed by setting the deletion indicator?
Answer:For performance reasons, updating of the change logging tables (CDHDR/CDPOS) is not supported when you set the deletion indicator via the initial archiving run.
===
So, please advise your user of this thread - and definitely consider this as part of your selection criteria for what gets archived - 
Hope this helps!

Hi,

We have a business flow that I would like to know how to handle in SAP ECC. The flow is like this:
Customer order a product from our company. We order the product from a supplier. We pickup the product at the supplier (we will then own the goods, FCA) and then it is shipped to the customer. This will be done between European countries, so Intrastat and Tax has to be considered. 
We will not have the goods in a physical storage location at any time from the vendor to the customer. It will be our stock during the delivery of the goods. 
How should this flow be setup in SAP?
Best Regards,
Ann-Sofie
Hello,
Based on the scenario described, it appears to be a third-party delivery process. 
Here's how you can set up the business flow in SAP ECC:
Create a Sales Order for the customer in the Sales and Distribution (SD) module, specifying the product and the delivery address.
Create a Purchase Order for the supplier in the Material Management (MM) module, specifying the product, delivery address, and delivery terms (FCA).
Create a Goods Receipt for the product when it is picked up from the supplier. This can be done in the MM module, where you will receive the goods and post the goods receipt, setting the delivery terms as FCA.
Create a Delivery for the customer in the SD module, using the goods received from the supplier. You will also specify the delivery address and other delivery-related information, such as the Intrastat and Tax codes.
When the goods are shipped to the customer, post the goods issue in the MM module, which will remove the stock from the goods receipt and deliver it to the customer.
Finally, you can invoice the customer in the SD module, either using the delivery document or creating a separate billing document.
This process will ensure that the goods are owned by your company during the delivery process, and that the Intrastat and Tax codes are correctly considered. Additionally, you will be able to keep track of the entire flow of the goods, from the supplier to the customer, in SAP ECC.
why do you pick up the product from the supplier? You can use third party processing scenario where the supplier will deliver the product directly to the customer and will bill you.

Hi,
How can I disable the beta features of a CF Subaccount ? It was a simple mark to enable it and now I can't find a way to disable the features. None is used in this subaccount...
Thank you for your help
Hi Yann, 
I'm afraid I don't think you can disable it afterwards.
The text clearly states:
"Enables the use of beta services and applications in this subaccount.
You cannot disable this setting in this subaccount once you have enabled it.
You should avoid using beta functionality in a production environment. SAP shall not be liable for any errors or damage arising from the use of such functionality."
OMG... I'm pretty sure this sentence was added afterwards. Anyway, thank you for the update!
Hello, 
 I want to create appliance for ABAP Platform 1909, Developer Edition. I have read the documentation, but is not clear for me why do we have to install the windows remote desktop as mandatory. 

 As per my understanding if I have installed in my local pc SAP GUI and Eclipse with the abap pluggins I should be able to connect with the ABAP Server located in AWS. I'm asking this since there is a cost for every VM and I don't want to spend extra money if is not necessary.

For mentioned by you appliance template both VAs are mandatory. In case of appliance template with optional VAs in Advanced Mode of Cerate Appliance wizard, you will be able to unselect the optional VAs (see the attached screenshot).

Hi everyone,
In my company we see that the process of changing manager is quite complex/difficult to get right for our HRBP's. 
They change the manager in employee profile/job information via the options when doing a termination or transfer, and expect it to be synced to position org. chart and company structure. However it does not, and this causes a lot of frustration is the business, in addition to potential data breaches and incorrect data of course. 
We are a global company where not necessarily the manager structure is straight forward. Have anyone else experienced issues with this and how did you solve it?
Thanks!

Hi Experts,We are about to implement S4HANA in our company in order to completely replace the SAP ERP we are using right now. Now I have seen contrary "signs" regarding the module Customer Service: In SAP note 2533548 I read "...Several data sources for BW extraction will no longer be available as part of product version SAP S/4HANA / SW component S4CORE after end-of-life of CS (Customer Service) which is announced for the year 2025. ..." On the other hand CS documentation is in place for S4HANA, without any indication for end-of-live: Start at https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/1809.002/en-US and follow Product Assistance => Enterprise Business Applications => Service => Customer Service (CS) all the way down, you will find CS documented... without any indication for end-of-life.Starting from note 2269324 I find a description of a "Compatibility Pack" (CP) for S4HANA, which as of now we are allowed to use only until end of december 31st, 2015.So my/our questions are: Are there any recomendations in place on how to replace CS? Is it possible using S4HANA only, or only by combining C4HANA and S4HANA. Are there other people/companies out here, interested in prolonged "life" of Customer Service as part of S4HANA? Or what are Your plans, how to support in SAP Systems processes for "serving customers", which you are doing with SAP ERP CS right now?Thanks, kind regards,Holger
Holger,
I cant imagine that SAP will remove all the ABAP code for SM/CS - it would take too long and a lot of clients would be very unhappy..
So my guess is that the SM/CS functionality will stay in SAP HANA, but that it just wont be supported anymore..
I would recommend talking to your SAP Account Manager to get a clear statement of intent from SAP.

Things change constanlty with SAP, so probably the best thing to do is contact your SAP Account Manager and ask them for the current status of CS lifecycle.

CRM_UI is integrated in S/4 HANA 1909. They do create service orders. These are different from service orders in CS. They are closer to sales orders. 
ECC or S/4 has a very tight check on billing which S/4 service is yet to match since there is an additional step of Billing Data Request (BDR). 
 The following are key MRO processes in A&D industries which use CS module.. It is not clear what are going to be replaced in the S4CRM Customer Management or Service module. 
Customer repair with RAS sales order to receive customer part with special stock E at no value, tear down, provide quotation, do repair, confirm and ship part back to customer. 
Support of inventory for project stock (special stock Q). 
ADSUBCON - vendor repair. This supports special stock types Q, C, E and plant stock.

I have created a tax code and it's exempted with 0.50 % up to 10500000 after this 2% need to calculate. So while defining tax code I have put 2% in tax and untick the formula base calculation as in ECC for exemption formula base calculation is not needed.Mapped invoice and payment tax code and type as well. And after creating the tax code gl assigned and maintained in vendor masters ticked liable and updated the CIN details with proper exemption rate amount from, to and all required detail and saved and while booking invoice in fv60 it is calculating 2% why so it should deduct 0.50 right?

Hi ALL,
I have modified the BS22 system status where I can successfully print the work orders after TECO. However, the shop papers does not contain Components/Material and I see only operations, but when I print the same shop paper before TECO status, I can see the Components clearly visible. Can anyone comment on this...
The Configuration is 100% accurate which is why I see the components printed successfully in shop paper before TECO. All the required configurations are maintained properly in OIDG,OIDF, OIDH....
Regards,
Basil
When you TECO an order, the reservations are automatically considered as "closed" or final issued. What happens if you final issue a material before you TECO the order and then you print ? I believe your issue is on your print program. Your print program might only print reservations which are not final issue. 
Hi experts,
I am planning to integrate GTS (Global Trade Service) to S/4HANA Cloud to set up compliance controls, custom management and preference management within my sales and purchasing processes. I checked the relevant scope items (24J, 2U1, 3JX, 1WA, etc.) and understood that you can integrate checks via RFC within your standard sales process. However, we also plan to use service order management, solution order management and subscription billing. Unfortunately, I could not find any information regarding the compatibility of GTS checks with those functionalities/process areas. Is it possible to integrate GTS for compliance checks, custom management and preference management with the processes for solution order management, subscription billing and service order management?
Thanks for your help!

Hi Team,There is an issue has been raising as we post the Supplier invoice with Reference to PO Number.we are using the Create Supplier invoice Application for posting the invoice.The issue has been appearing for the company code &&&&.Thank you
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.

Please note, that we have created Italy specific document types in Italy to be used for Supplier and Vendor invoices. In the test script J 60 we have details of Supplier document types available for posting in Italy.
In test script J 59 we have Customer document types.
We recommend you use Italy specific document types as they are correctly mapped to VAT registers and tax codes and in compliance with legal requirements in Italy.
In the test script J 60 under Invoice Entry without PO it is recommended that customer use IT LOC Vendor Purch -X1 instead of RE.

hello community,
I am facing a problem.
I would like to do a transNot that will allow me to Block an existing supplier reference number already in the database.
Here's what I'm trying to do but it's not working.
IF (@transaction_type = 'A' or @transaction_type = 'U') AND @object_type = '18'
BEGIN
if exists (SELECT DISTINCT T0.NumAtCard FROM OPCH T0  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM OPCH ) AND T0.DocEntry = @list_of_Cols_val_tab_del)

SET @error = 10
SET @error_message = N'Saissisez un numéro de référence client/fournisseur différent'
end

END<br>
Can someone help me please?
Thanks in advance everyone.
Hi,
There are 2 option:
1. Document Settings >>> Per Document >>> A/P Invoice

2. Transaction Notification
IF (@transaction_type = 'A' or @transaction_type = 'U') AND @object_type = '18'
BEGIN
if exists (SELECT T0.DocEntry FROM OPCH T0 WHERE T0.NumAtCard in (SELECT T0.NumAtCard FROM OPCH T0 WHERE T0.DocEntry <> list_of_Cols_val_tab_del and T0.Cancelled='N') 
AND T0.DocEntry = @list_of_Cols_val_tab_del)
SET @error = 10
SET @error_message = N'Saissisez un numéro de référence client/fournisseur différent'
end

Hello, in BAS follow the steps below:
1. Click on SAP Fiori from the left vertical menu
2. On the SAP Fiori Application Modeler find and click on your object page
3. In the Page Editor for your Object Page, find your table and click on it
4. Find "Use Export to Excel" property and set it to true
Here's a screenshot detailing the steps indicated above with the same number for each action:

Hi All, can any one suggest how to extract all the list of pure substance from a specification with help of table I need to export for 2000 specification 
Hello
i try to read between the lines. If you have a REAL_SUB and if you check STANDARD property tree: we have a huge number pf properties/value assignments which are of type "B" (specification listing) and "C" composition.
For this huge number of properties: we can have data. E.g an object of type "PURE_SUB" is used.
You can use on of these options to get a solution (If i have understood your topic correct)
Option 1: use SAP EHS standard export with a "specific" property tree combining any property of type "B" or "C"
Option 2: use the output variant "EXCEL" to get the data 
Option 3: You can try to prepare a "SQVI" query.
I propose to start with option 2; There is only one limitation: you can not use more than 50 properties in one run. BUt if this is a "one and only" action;
This is simple and any user can do it (topic of access rights etc.)
For 1 and 3: you need more access rights and you need to be an expert (especially for 3) to do the job

Hello, As is shown in the screenshot, I am trying to apply a data transform which should take the SQL from Run Hana SQL with message.table data type .I need to convert the message.table to table data type to be able to apply data transform operations .first python operator contains 3 different queries from different connections and runs in Run Hana SQL.Any suggestions, please?
Hi,
You can try two options below:
1. replace the operator "Run HANA SQL" with the operator "SQL consumer", "SQL Consumer"'s output can be directly accepted by "Data Transform".
2. replace "Data Transform" with "python" or other operators to do the transformation you want. The "Python" operator almost can do any transformation you want.

Hello everyone,
i built a graph in Data Intelligence that is reading data from different HANA tables into a data transform operator. The output of that operator is a final table that i would like to push into our SAC by using the SAP Analytics Cloud Formatter operator. Now i have the problem of different data types and i don´t know how i can convert the output from the data transform so that i can use it as input for the Analytics Cloud Formatter.
Thanks for any help!
Hi Jannis,
within DI you should find an operator called Table to message converter which should meet your requirements. The documentation for the operator can be found here. 
Depending on the case you want to achieve you could also prevent using the SAP Analytics Cloud Formatter as the output of the Table to message converter operator is already of type message if you want to use for example the SAP Analytics Cloud Producer operator.

Hi SAP Experts,
In the starter system, we are following the test script 4GT for Solution Order. While entering the employee responsible in order we are getting this error. Please assist me in resolving this. I have tried the suggestions in error description but could not find solution yet.
The field says CB9980000001 (does not exist)
Partner CB9980000001 (Employee Responsible) is neither an employee nor an organizational unit
Diagnosis
You have entered a name or number that does not exist in the business partner master data. This can be for the following reasons:

The person, organization, or hierarchy has not been defined in the master data.


The name or number represents a partner who has been defined in an area other than business partner master data, for example, in Human Resources.

System Response
The system cannot determine the business partner.
For example, the system cannot recognize an employee's user ID as a business partner unless the employee has been entered as a business partner, and the master data includes his or her user ID.
Procedure
Create a corresponding business partner with the partner number or a group hierarchy with the description CB9980000001.
If you use a name or another number as the partner number:

Check whether the entry has been maintained in the master data for this partner.


If you use a user ID, check that it is maintained in the User field for the role Employee in the master data for the partner you want. You can only maintain this field if personnel data is not delivered by a human resources system.


If your entry is for a group hierarchy that the system cannot find, use the input help.

Hi Kumar,
The CB user number is not the BP number. You can try "Maintain Business User" app and search the CB user to see what the name of the CB user.
Hope this helps.

Daniel

I'm having some issues upgrading an app to newer versions.Where can I get / find dev documents/api reference/object referencefor older ActiveX versions.I inherited code / app and the previous dev used the following "using"that is giving me problems.using CRAPI = CRAXDRT;
Any help / suggestions would be greatly appreciated.TIA
Hi David,
As Shawn noted the legacy RDC is no longer installed.
You can convert the old CR code to use Version 13 CR for Visual Studio.
Installers and other info is here:
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/Crystal+Reports%2C+Developer+for+Visual+Studio+Downloads
On that WIKI page I wrote 2 sample to get you going, one printing and the other one for Set Parameters and get other parts and one for printing, you can combine them if you want.
how-to-parameters-in-crystal-reports-for-visual-studio-net
Printing Crystal Reports in .NET
I also wrote a blog on upgrading existing .NET to the latest here which can help you to upgrade:
https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/30/upgrading-a-visual-studio-2008-2019-.net-project-with-the-latest-cr-.net-sdk-packages/
Don
Some notes:
1. I have attached some of the old RDC help documentation here (The 11.5 version).  Just rename the attachment to rdcsdk-com-doc.zip and unzip the file rdcsdk-com-doc.txt
2. You can find the RDC object model under the section "Report Designer Component Object Model"
3. What I believe is happening here is that with the RDC you often had to create objects.  e.g. Dim app as New CRAXDRT.Application or Dim foo as CRAXDRT.Sections.  So what I believe is happening here is your previous dev - instead of using CRAXDRT - they decided to reassign CRAXDRT as CRAPI.  So if you look in your code, you will likely see many variable declarations that look like Dim myVar as CRAPI.<ObjectType>
If this is the case, you can get rid of that line by simply searching for anywhere you find CRAPI and replace it with CRAXDRT
Note: RDC / CRAXDRT was deprecated in XI R2 and completely removed in XI R3 - so if you are trying to upgrade to a version past XI R3 - your only option is to completely rewrite the application.

Hey folks, 
we want to receive mixed HUs via RF. Inbound delivery items are not packed yet. We want to be able to create the HUs at the RF with n different materials, post GR and trigger the WT creation (based on given storage process).
Does anybody have experience how to achieve this with standard RF? If not, did anybody do some custom coding and is willing to share his/her experiences?

Thanks
Hendrik
Hi

Hi Hendrik,
I solved this scenario in following way:
1. Pack all delivery items into one (“collective “) HU
2. Create and confirm unloading WT for this HU. During the RF unloading I also allow to create new HU’s with unknown content. 3. I set up POSC with deconsolidation step. When posting GR for collective HU, system creates deconsolidation tasks for materials and/or partial quantities. 4. perform deconsolidation by which I repack quantities from collective HU into target HU’s for put away. This is in fact a counting process, which allows also Corections of GR quantity if necessary. And mainly - it allows you to create mixed HU’s, depending on target storage types for put away. This scenario works fine and we developed some features for this (for example recording of BBD during deconsolidation process, which is not in standard). If you would still need some details, feel free to write me!
Regards
Martin
Hi Mukesh,
in fact we created PPF action on TU level, which packs all delivery items to one HU within one TU automatically. But you can use also the UI transaction /SCWM/PRDI > Pack
We do not pack using RF.

Hi all,
we are trying to use transaction IDCP for Settlement documents in Chile (using prenumbered forms), but when processing the same the system shows that no document is selected. The support team was investigating the same and found that message VR490 ("No documents were found for these selection criteria") is getting raised because table APOC_D_OR_ITEM does not contain any entry for APPL_OBJECT_TYPE = SETTLEMENT_DOCUMENT.
It turned out that this is related to output management, but unfortunately we are not able to switch to S/4 HANA Output Management, so we are now searching for a solution to this case using traditional output management.
Hopefully somebody can help us with this.
Thank you,
 Sebastian
hi, setting up SAP ONE. whats the best way to send stock from our warehouse to our own stores ? like a sales order, a PO or transfer stock? we do not have the WH program. 
Hi.
In one scenario, records in Inbound IDOC are coming at the same time(even the same second) and there can be multiple line items in that one IDOC. Data is dumped into the Custom table and then process further.
Now suppose one IDOC has 3 line items, 1st line item is pushed to the custom table successfully, next one is giving an error in some instances - 'Error inserting a record into custom table Z*'.
It is only happening in that instance when 2 or more records come at the same item then one of the items in IDOC result in below error

Please suggest how to resolve or any workaround so that all record will save in custom table.
How were unique keys defined in the intermediate Z-table, can you consider

Hello SAP Experts,
I'm trying to identify all condition types used during fiscal year to check if they were all configured as "B - Automatic Entry has Piority" or "D - Not possible to Process Manually"
First I started with table VBAK to identify all types of sales documents used during fiscal year.
Then I used table TVAk to identify all pricing procedures assigned to sales documents used during fiscal year.
Then I used table T683S to identify condition types associated with my pricing procedures.
Problem is I can't find some of the condition types identified in table T683s when I check in table T685A. Can someone tell me where is the error?

Gostaria de saber se é possível fazer uma consulta em massa das requisições de compra que foram recusadas pelo setor de compras. Trabalho no setor de projetos, algumas das solicitações são recusadas e não somos informados previamente sobre as mesmas. Tentamos utilizar a transação ME5A, porém ela não consulta itens em aprovação ou com recusa. Tentamos cruzar as informações da transação ZPS3 e ZPORTAL, conseguimos verificar quais são as RCs com recusa, mas não temos o informativo sobre o motivo da recusa de compras. Como é feito um Follow Up geral da área para serviços e materiais/equipamentos, se tiver várias recusas, onera um pouco o tempo para entrar item a item para fazer essa verificação. 
In the supply chain cockpit I am seeing that the MAD date is after the transportation planning date. I hadn't noticed before, as my products are MTF and the delivery will create, and batch prior to MAD. But for MTO products, having the MAD date after the delivery creation date, generates planned orders after the delivery should be created. 
Looking at the dates, it seems the MAD date is the same amount of days after delivery creation date, as the days of transportation planning time in the sales order route. 
What can we do to make the MAD date and delivery creation date the same? Or even the MAD date a day prior to delivery creation date?
Dear Community.
I had a question regarding BP roles in SAP S4HAHA.
I created a new BP using Tcode BP, and assigned a BP role "Customer" to it. A BP number was generated and 
When I try to extend it to a sales area, It got assigned perfectly.
Then I went ahead and changed the same BP role to something else "Say general" , and then It no longer allowed me to change the sales area or even create a new one.
My question.
Is there any config that allows us to map specific operations like extending sales area to other specific BP roles ( Including custom created ones.).
Thank you in advance.
Ramiwal Dsilva
The issue could be that the BP role you are trying to assign to the BP is not compatible with the Sales Area that you are trying to assign it to. You can check the BP role compatibility in the IMG (SAP Implementation Guide) under the "Business Partner" tab. Once you have identified the compatible BP roles, you can then assign them to the BP and extend it to the Sales Area.
Hello colleagues,
I hope everybody has come across SAP ANALYTICS CLOUD!!!!
I am currently trying to use effective R visuals than traditional ggplot2 package, Do you think or have you used plotty or Shiny in your visuals.
Plotty is good but requires login if its online, shiny is free and can provide interactive ux and visuals like sapui5 input dynamic text control.
Is it possible to use Shiny at least??? have you tried or please provide me direction to use it or if not please let me know that its not supported in SAC.

Br,

Hi Imane Rifqui 
As you can see in your screenshots the type of column in your varpay employee history is wrong (vlfd = text and not numeric)


try setting salary as ffld2 and tgtpct as ffld3 (as long as these are not already used which you can check by browsing through other columns) then try editing your custom basis formula in VarPay again.

Hi,I am wondering what does this mean in the purchase request ID field:
When I look for the actual ID in cloud application studio it finds "19".So how do I find 19-1 instead of say 19-2 in cloud application studio?In what field are the 1 and 2 stored?These purchse requests are turned into purchase orders and I need to find for each purchase order its associated purchase request.Thanks in advance.
It's a combination of two values.
You can open the screen "prowllist.OWL" in the SAP Cloud Application Studio and see how it is composed.
Probably it's the original document's ID + a line number.
Dear Friends,

Kindly suggest solution to below problem,


Costing items for material 21000001 in plant 204A without cost element.
Message no. CK597

Diagnosis
The itemization for material 21000001 in plant 204A contains valuation-relevant items without a cost element.

System Response
The costs of these item(s) cannot be included in the cost component split. This means that there will be inconsistencies between the cost component split and the itemization.

Procedure
Check the log for further system messages for material 21000001 in plant 204A. Correct the error and carry out costing again.


Thanks

Hi all,
How can I set the following Fiori Apps like DISPLAY MODE (no change, no create)???
FS00 Edit G / L Account - Central View
F1443A Manage Cost Center (Version 2)
Where to intervene starting from the PFCG GUI? How can I proceed?
The case: the user can ONLY display le Account List and Cost Center List.
Could you please help me?
Thank you,
Antonio
Hi Antonio Lobusto,
Firstly, of course as Gregor says the user must not have edit authorizations for cost centers.
On top of that, Fiori elements app provides "UI Adaptation" function, on which you are able to adapt List Report UI, including removing "Create" / "Edit" / "Delete" etc... buttons. Please refer to the following microlearning & blog.
Extending SAP-delivered SAP Fiori elements apps using adaptation projects to create SAP S/4HANA app variants

After pressing "Save as" and creating an app variant where you removed some buttons/texts, you will have a message like below;

You are able to create new Fiori tile with this dedicated app ID for new variant, where you do not see CRUD buttons.
Hope it helps.

Hello,
does anyone has set up something like this:
ECC – CloudConnector - HCI (CPI)?
Or the other way HCI - CloudConnector - ECC 
If yes how do I need to configure the CloudConnector and ECC side?
Regards David
Hi David
Cloud Connector is not needed in the ECC to CPI direction. Communication from on-premise to SAP Cloud Platform happens directly over the Internet (encrypted, of course). From CPI to ECC, however, you need some way of accessing the on-premise system, which is behind at least one firewall. Cloud Connector solves that problem.
The documentation on help.sap.com is quite good. I suggest you start here, and then follow the directions in the section "Connecting Cloud Applications to On-Premise Systems".
Regards,
Morten
Hi David,
This is regarding your post "https://answers.sap.com/questions/12690486/problem-with-https-connection-over-soap-receiver.html"
We are also facing the same issue. You have mentioned as missing cipher suites as the reason. May I know the details about it so that it will help us in solving the issue.
Thanks in advance,
Mahendran B.
Dear David,
Consider below points for connectivity and data transfer between CPI to ECC(inbound) on premise.
Step1:-In Cloud connector.
configure internal host and port of ECC with virtual host and port.(as your wish), protocol as http and back-end Type as ABAP system, then check the server reachability .
then go to resource tab and click "+" and fill below details.
Url Path:-/sap/(it will be change depends on your serveries(web,odata))
active:-check
websocket:-uncheck
access policy:-path and all sub paths , click "save" .
Step2:-In BTP create destination .
create new destination using destination under connectivity , plz fill below details
Name:-ur sap system name
type:-http
url:-https://your virtual host and port(what you have configure in cloud connector)
proxy type:-onpremise
authentication:-basic aunthentication
then click "new property " tab and enter below details
Webidesystem:-gateway
sapclient:-ur sap client(ex 300,500,866..)
webideenable:-true
webideusage:-web
setp3:-in CPI configure the ECC server uid and pwd.
Operation and monitor tab->manage security->security material->Create->User credentials.
name:-give a name(this name should be configure in credential name in connection tab in communication channel )
des:-
Type:-User credentails
user & PWD:-user name and pwd should be created separately in ecc for cpi to configure here.

Hi,
Is it possible to activate ERS for Goods Return to vendor process only? I know we can have this setup for Invoice and Credit Notes but our requirement is to process ERS/MRRL only for Credit Memo (Returns) 
Note: We are processing returns via MIGO goods return process. We don't want to create a separate PO for returns. Anyone knows if this is possible and advice how can this be done?
Thanks,
Aloy
Hello https://people.sap.com/aloysius,
Please refer below SAP thread. As described first change the config and test in quality system. 
To return goods you need to only use MIGO transaction, there is non other way to return goods.
https://answers.sap.com/questions/4427880/how-to-reverse-an-ers-invoice.html
Regards,
Neeraj Jain 
Are you cancelling that material document (which created with 101 movement type)  with 102 movement type?
For ERS,GR posted with 101 movement type and upon MRRL, the invoice document automatically and also if you cancel material document which created with 101 movement type, system will create a new material document with 102 movement type and if you run MRRL with that cancelled material document- Check how your system behaving and you may adopt this option for your case!
Hi, I'm Gonzalo, and I have a trial version for 30 days in SAP Analytics Cloud.
When I try to import data, it stays in a "loading" state for a long time.
Then it returns an error ".xlsx has failed to upload because the data acquisition service encountered an internal error.
Correlation ID: 88354746-2123-4784-9512-147897013310 error.png
How can I do to solve it?
This sort of error is normally due to a transient issue with a backend service and should normally be resolved without any specific action on your part.
Can you test again in a few hours to see if the issue is still occurring?
Also, have you been able to import data previously or is this the first time you attempt to do so?
Regards,
Peter
Good morning at all,
I am facing the same problem. I try to import data since Tuesday this week, but the import does not succeed - with the same error than Gonzalo reported above. It is also the first time, that I try to import data to the SAC Trial.It does not make a difference if I use the datasets-tab, the modeler-tab, or the story tab to use the import function. Only thing I can see, that it stops at "28%", when using the story-tab.Nevertheless, waiting and re-trying the import is nit the solution, as the error occurs for several days now.I also tried the upload from different machines in different networks - this seems to be a server related issue.As I am heading for doing the certification by the end of this month, it is very annoying that I cannot use the tool in order of an appropriate way of learning so far. As I originally thought it might be a file issue on my site, I talked to Antoine CHABERT in another blog here and tried to import a file that he recommended from his github.https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antoinechabert/predictive/master/product_forecast_planning.csvUnfortuantely, with the same result.Can you please check the trial tenant again? Just one last thought: Maybe it has something to do with the trial-accounts that have recently been created this week, Thank you very much in advance for your support. Time is ticking.....Regards,Uwe
Hi  Peter KREUTLEIN what is the best route to tackle this problem? Should Uwe & Gonzalo create support tickets with SAP (if possible for them)? Best regards Antoine

Hi,
What is the impact of upgrading to S/4 Hana on IS Utilities module? I think i could not see any difference other than cloud enablement ? 
Hello Ricky
the answer would a bit depend on different perspectives.
When you would ask, what functionality and capability you would loose by going to SAP S/4HANA Utilities, I would say only CIC0. CIC0 is not available in S/4HANA Utilities. But there is a new - let me name it - "module" called "SAP S/4HANA Utilities for customer engagement" which could be understood as the new "embedded" interaction center in SAP S/4HANA Utilities. 
All the rest you know from the IS-U in ECC will still be there.
But of course you will win capabilities you didn´t have had before ... please have a look at the product help pages of SAP S/4HANA Utilities and SAP S/4HANA Utilities for customer engagement. In case of more demand of knowledge please contact the SAP Account Executive of your company.

Hi, 
I'm getting the error - Cannot connect to the Service Instance. The service is currently not available, while am trying to login to my existing trail account via eclipse ADT. Could you please help me to resolve the issues?
It had been working fine until today when I started to get this error.

I created a query to fetch:
What I have in stock + the last purchase price.
But when I use the MAX() function, it looks for some value that I couldn't find out. And if I don't use MAX() on certain columns, the query simply duplicates the values.
It could be something simple, but I couldn't find the error. I redid this query a few times and when it gets more complex is when it starts to duplicate.
Your help is kindly appreciated.

Hello,
I am using an expression that is not giving the expected result. Is there a way to reach the expected result using modern syntax ?
To reach the expected result I have to use instruction CONDENSE NO-GAPS

Here the piece of code that you can use (sorry the code formatting is not working for me) : 
REPORT ztest.  START-OF-SELECTION.  DATA ls_lips TYPE lips. DATA goodsmvt_header TYPE bapi2017_gm_head_01.  ls_lips-vbeln = '1981000A'. ls_lips-posnr = 10.  NEW-LINE. POSITION 30. WRITE '*'.  NEW-LINE. WRITE 'Expression '. POSITION 30. WRITE '|{ ls_lips-vbeln ALPHA = OUT }-{ ls_lips-posnr ALPHA = OUT }|' COLOR COL_GROUP NO-GROUPING. NEW-LINE. POSITION 31. WRITE / 'where ls_lips-vbeln = ''1981000A'' and ls_lips-posnr = 10' COLOR COL_GROUP NO-GROUPING.   goodsmvt_header-ref_doc_no = |{ ls_lips-vbeln ALPHA = OUT }-{ ls_lips-posnr ALPHA = OUT }| . NEW-LINE. WRITE 'Result'. POSITION 30. WRITE goodsmvt_header-ref_doc_no COLOR COL_NEGATIVE.   * NEW-LINE. WRITE 'Expected Result'. CONDENSE goodsmvt_header-ref_doc_no NO-GAPS. POSITION 30. WRITE goodsmvt_header-ref_doc_no COLOR COL_POSITIVE. 

If you debug your code, you will notice that LS_LIPS-VBELN is of type C and length 10.
So, your only question about this code...
... is why DUMMY contains 2 trailing spaces (as you can see with the debugger)?

Look at ABAP documentation for explanations about ALPHA = OUT.

Etc.
Dear Experts,
I want to use the owner on the header of a transaction to restrict the data.
But I only can user the owner on the Business master data to restrict.
I check so much document also tell that I can user the owner on the header. As the below picture.

But It does not work when I apply the authorize for the Header Owner.
Please help me how to use this.
Hi There, 
Please make all the users are defined as employees in emoloyee master data, manager and teams are assigned as well in the employee master data otherwise data ownership will not work.

Hi
How can we set up GPO pricing without multiplying the pricing records for each individual customer belonging to that GPO?
Contracts are maintained in another system which interfaces the pricing elements under pricing records. Meaning that there are no sales contracts maintained in S4 for those.
Today the incoming interface checks the members of the GPO and send as many records (all the same) as there are customers belonging to that GPO. This is very heavy in terms of performance and pricing maintenance.
With the 2021 release (on premise) I am hoping that new apps might be useful for this.I also read somewhere that we couldn’t use customer hierarchies because one customer can only belong to one hierarchy…
thanks
Hello Guys,
I have code here where SAP is blocking the user if the Department is null. But this transaction is for Item Doc Type. I need your help on how i can make this code for Service Doc Type.
here is the code:
IF :object_type = '1470000113' AND (:transaction_type = 'A' OR :transaction_type = 'U') THEN
 SELECT COUNT(a."DocEntry") INTO Count1 FROM "OPRQ" a
 inner join PRQ1 b on a."DocEntry" = b."DocEntry"
 WHERE a."DocEntry" = list_of_cols_val_tab_del
 and IFNULL(a."U_ItemClassification",'') = '02'
 and ifnull(b."OcrCode",'') = '';
 IF Count1 > 0 THEN
 error := -100002;
 error_message := 'You cannot add Purchase Request without Department!';
 END IF;
 END IF; 
Hi,
You just will have to add a condition of DocType. 
Condition will be And a."DocType" = 'S'
Hope this helps.
Regards

SAP Business One 10.0 version for SAP HANA.
As of SAP Business One version 9.3, the following new checkbox is added in Administration → System Initialization → General Settings → BP tab:
'Enable Updating the Document Generated/Updated by Approval Process'
When this checkbox is selected, the Sales Order or Purchase Order documents after approved and added, the user can amend it. E.g. close row, update delivery date, update qty, price & etc. Is there anyway, we can restrict the user be able to close row only, but not able to update e.g. qty, price & etc.?
There is no standard way to do it, however you can user transaction notification to have customized controls. If you want to learn how to work with transaction notification please have a look at this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ausZs3AOHq8&t=308s
Hi expert,
When we trying Enter Import PO from PR the Import Checkbox get disable automatically.
What could be the reason ?
Attached screenshot.

Krishna Varma 
Hi there,
It looks you have a customised tab on PO that is from an add on or UI so you should ask your developer to explain how it works or why its not working. 
SAP Business One 10.0 version for SAP HANA (10.00.150) FP 2102 (64-bit).
The issue happen suddenly.
It happen to all Sales Quotation with 'Text' type row and it happen to all PLD with 'Text' type row print out. The same PLD if I duplicated it to a new PLD then there is no issue. The customer need an explanation why this happen.
Please refer to the attached print screen, PLD layout of existing layout print out vs the duplicated PLD layout print out. The 'Text' Type row print out of the existing layout show some text truncated, some rows print to the next row, email address printed out duplicate data, please refer to the yellow highlight. 
The issue doesn't happen to existing test DB, I have yet to try duplicate the live DB to new test DB.

It could be something in the page setting of PLD or text box setting e.g. its centralized/divided in to rows/right alligned.  now most of people switched to crystal report, my suggest is to switch to crystal report and you will have a lot of flexibilities. 
Dear all,

I have strange issue with SAP B1 for HANA and with HANA itself. 
When users are logging to SAP B1 it takes about 2 minutes to log in, durning that time SAP B1 client hangs, goes gey and stops responding for that time.After successfully login SAP B1 works fine. 
When I restart HANA engine (./HDB stop,start) for about 5 minutes it is ok – login to SAP B1 take a second.
And then, after 5 minutes of working HANA, login to SAP B1 takes 2 minutes again…

Is it releated to HANA statisticsserver somehow? Log volume (hdb00003 folder) for this service is groving 30 GB big in one month.

What can be the issue? Where to check ?

Regards
GN
I have the seem issue, takes a long time to log on..
Does any body could fix this problem?
The same issue we are also facing
There are several things that affects the performance of SAP B1 client on login. Please check there are no unread messages in the user's inbox sometime when number of unread mesages is high SAP client takes time because it loads on login.
Please disable all add-ons and try, sometime such delay is caused by add-ons. 
Please disable cockpit and try sometimes problem in integration framework effect the performance.
Once you identify the problamentic component it will be easy to fix it.

Hi Mehul,
Is it not possible for you to add on the PO screen the opposite of this to show how many of each item on the PO are still outstanding?POR1.[OpenCreQty]On this, two of the same item have been ordered, one has already been received and shows on a GRPO, so one is still outstanding.

Hi there,
You can do it through transaction notification by using an update statement but please remenber incase of using update statemetn you may loose SAP support. 
Anyone have the latest SAP B1 Localizations comparison in excel, where it allow you to compare the different when you choose the localization. Don't seems to be able to get it from SAP portal. Thanks!
No, best way is to have a call or chat with local product expert form SAP team and he will suggest you the most common localisation according to your region. 
Hi, 
The customer server is in the private cloud, according to SAP the proper login is to connect to VPN, then remote (RDP) login to the Terminal Server (TS)same network as the SAP server. 

The issue here is, the customer encounter slowness when login to SAP via RDP to the TS. However, when they tried login to the SAP using local client, the performance is much better. 
After we checked, we noticed that their HANA server resources contently very high, as such cause performance issue. So suggest them to increase HANA server resources.
But the thing is the customer keep asking why it is that when they use SAP local client at the PC (not via TS) even though it is not SAP recommended method, the performance is much better? Technically speaking, if the issue is due to HANA server resources, whether they access SAP via TS or their PC local client, the users should encounter slowness consistently. 
Any idea?
Hi There,
I am not sure how the cloud is setup, normally for better performance terminal server and database server should be on same cluster otherwise people face perofrmance issues

Hello,
I think this is because of Indexing.Can you try Indexing or search for new message which is processed after the configuraiton of UDS.
Hi Raghu,
Thanks for the response.
Based on my understanding Indexing can be used only in case of Adapter Engine (Single stack) and not for Integration Engine (Dual Stack).
I have built the UDS in dual stack and is for Integration engine. Also I have processed the interface after building the UDS but still it is not showing the message in SXMB_MONI while it shows in 
SXMS_LMS_CONF.
Can you please help me with your comments.
Regards,
Abhi
Hello Abhishek,
If am not wrong Indexing is possible in IE also.
Anyways in your case after configuration also messages are not displayed.Can you double check if your checking with correct filter criteria.
And also post the screeenshots.
Hi Abhishek!
If I'm not wrong, you can use report SXMS_EXTRACT_MESSAGES on ABAP stack to index previous messages.
Regards, Evgeniy.

Hi Raghu,
Below are the screenshots of the config,
SXMS_LMS_CONF


SXMB_MONI


 Please let me know your comments.

Hi Raghu,
I have tried to use the Standard Selection criterion and am able to get the details there but when I have populated the details in User-Defined Selection criterion, I am getting "No messages found".
In case anybody still looking for solution 
for the messages before UDS, you need to perform indexing

I have several accounts that aren't bringing over the data. If you drill down on the line item, it shows the ACTUAL balance, but it's not populating the field within the budget, nor the report. 
Also, If there is a "zero" budgeted item, but an associated actual amount, it's not dropping from the account either.

Dear all,
We are using SAP Business One 10.0 version for SAP HANA (10.00.190) FP 2202. 
I have changed the ip address of SUSE Linux (from 192.168.1.3 to 192.168.99.3) and then did Rename the SAP HANA Database System from hdblcmgui. I was able to connect to SAP HANA via SAP HANA Studio. 
Then, according to SAP Note 1999390 and SAP Business One Administrator's Guide, version for SAP HANA (Chapter 7.8 Reconfiguring the System), I updated the ip address of SAP Business One Components. 
But, when checking the Shared Folders for SAP B1 Server, Shared Folder -> Shared Folder from Common DB = it's showing "Not accessible" with old ip address.

How to update the ip address of Shared Folder from Common DB?
Also, from ControlCenter, in Services tab, I noticed that out of all services, only APIGateway Service did not get updated with new ip address. How to change this as well?

Thank you!
I had similar situation, I had to reinstall all the components by using DNS instead of IP.

Dear All,
I'm beginner in CPI and was trying to understand from documentation about the difference between a header and property in a message. Please validate my understanding.
1. Header is like HTTP header where we can store small attributes and pass it align with message. It will be part of the message and hence the scope is global in the sense that any step can see the header along with the receiver. My doubt is if we have a multiple sub processes in an iFlow like local integration process then the header variables can be seen by all of them?2. Property is like a container where it is internal to a process and it can't be sent to receiver. But what is the scope of property in an iflow?
Is it explained better anywhere? 
Hi Abraham,
Headers and Properties can be used in any local integration process in an iflow.
Let me give you an example :
Suppose I have two integration flows ( IF1,IF2), where IF2 is connected to IF1 via process direct .
Now properties in IF1 cannot be accessed in IF2 because the scope of property is with the iflow (IF1), but where as headers created in the IF1 can be accessed in IF2 because it as global scope.
Hi All,

My base unit of measure for material length, width and height is millimeter. Based on this system is calculating the volume automatically. This volume is automatically picked up with volume unit Hecto-liter, whereas we need the unit of measure as CDM (Cubic Decimeter). Is there any standard setting/table maintenance/anyother solution to achieve this?

Thanks in advance for your reply.

Best Regards,
Prakash
Change the unit of measure to CD3 (Cubic Decimeter) from HL (Hecto liter) in material master.

Thanks

Ashish
Dear Prakash ,

Enter at tcode CUNI , under VOLUME press  and use unit of measure that you need.
You will find CDM for example.

Hope this can help you.

How can I fixed the issue? Thanks
Victor
Hi Victor,
Can you confirm this is for "SAP Process Automation" or "SAP IRPA". 
Also confirm what mode of subscription are you on (Free Tier / Free Trail / CPEA / Pay-As-You-Go / Subscription)
Background:
Basically there are limitations (quota) for each type of subscription.
eg.

Solution:
As per the message you have reached max number of concurrent unattended bot executions OR concurrent unattended agents deployed
You can try disabling one or more of the active unattended bots / agents and bring down the number.
Note: from your screenshot it seems that same project "Sales Order Managem... v1..." seems to be scheduled multiple times concurrently. Maybe that should be the first one to target. Have minimum no. of unattended bots / agents active and remove rest of the duplicates that may not be needed

We have a requirement to create a new field in PROJ table. There are some unused User Defined fields provided by SAP like USR00 which meets our requirements.Can we use this field for our business requirements or is the best practice to create a new custom field in PROJ table?
One drawback of using USR00 is that the field name is generic and developer may not know where it is being used?

Hi Sachin,
I would say standard user fields should be the first option before you consider new fields.
If you would use same Field Key to label this field on the UI same label will be picked up in the reports field selection.  Business users should not see technical names as a basic rule and the developer will follow a functional spec document anyway.

Hi

try this weblog

Thanks

Hi,
Use event 05 for filling your fields when a record is created, use event 21 for changes. As for coding in the called routines:

form edit_date. 
move: sy-datum to your_table_name-change_date,
 sy-uzeit to your_table_name-change_time.
endform.

hope this helps, kind regards, Kathrin!
As of my knowledge, u cant update the new fields to the exixting Ztable with the data. U have to create new table with all the fields agin and then add the data. 


Cheers
I answered the exact same question a few minutes back in another thread. Hope this works.
read table new entry

For the others who have answered this question:

I tried referencing the table directly and whenever i enter multiple entries the validations where failing. I could not do a loop at table. My validations were supposed to be triggered only at the time of saving the entries and not at the time of entry. Anybody has a workaround besides what i have described in the post??
I need to display a value up to 2 decimal places. When it comes to values like 0.50 it will display like 0.5 only, but I need 0.50 .What should I do ?
Hi Pratiksha,
Have the data declaration for the variable as packed with decimals equals to 2.
Thanks,
Pavan
Hi Pratiksha,
I hope this helps. Define the 'correct' type to 'p' and hopefully it will work. Cheers!!! :)
PARAMETERS: p_num1 TYPE p DECIMALS 2.
Hi All,
I need to validate Material Number and Batch Number field on EWM RF screen. These fields will be scanned using scan gun on the initial screen itself. There will not be verification profile as such. 
My requirement is to validate the scanned field and move to next screen if validations are passed. I created a verification profile but there are 2 problems
1. Verification field comes disabled when logical transaction is loaded as IV_FLG_VERIFIED comes with vale 'X' before adding any value on input screen. 
2. Also, even though If I enable it somehow, and value is entered in Material field, on hitting enter , control does not go to backed verification FM configured against field. 
In configuration, I have mentioned FM and enables check box. Also, at screen level- group 3 has value - 002
Could you help me with what might have gone wrong . 
Thanks !!
I am trying to create an instance in ABAP trial using my SCP trial account. But i am receiving an service broker error which says "broker failed with Internal server error". Any idea on how to resolve this issue?

Hi guys. Try specifying your email address.

Hi Sarada.
Check this SAP note https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2802766
Regards
SS
The first time I created the ABAP Environment service, it was created without a problem. Later I deleted the ABAP Environment service to create it again. When trying to create the service again, I got the error:
Service broker error: Service broker abap-trial-broker failed with: Internal Server Error.
After several attempts to create the service again, it occurred to me to change the e-mail that I put in the JSON format and again the ABAP Environment service was created correctly. Because when it asked me to define the e-mail, I put the one I used when I created the service for the first time.
From what I deduce that the e-mail that is placed when creating the service is registered somewhere for the SAP user that is used in the SAP STP Trial.
Possible solution:
Change the email.
I have the same problem and can´t check the note. Is there any solution?
Yes, the issue still occurs!
The solution provided in 2802766 doesn't seem to be relevant to ABAP Trial. But the error is same.
Also, please note JSON parameters are different. Any idea how to resolve??
Thanks
Same issue here. Note 2802766 is not relevant for this issue. The issue presents when trying to add an instance to an ABAP Trial service. I'm following exactly the same steps depicted at:
https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-trial-onboarding.html

Hi, anyone found the solution ? I was able to create the instance earlier. But the account was inactive for sometime but now I am facing the issue. How did you guys solve the problem ?
I changed the email id other than what I use to login and I was able to create the instance.
We have several processes that require multiple teams to take action on a single request. For example, to create a customer account 4 different teams take action. When a team completed their action, how can we automatically assign the ticket to the next team? Is it possible to set those auto assignments for each ticket?
Hello experts,
after a long time of research I don't find a suitable solution.I created a structure with two components. Each component has an explicit search help with its parameters assigned to the components. Component 2 has a search result only when a value in components 1 has been set.
This works fine. Enter comp1, use search help of comp2, get values based on comp1, and select a value.
report z_my_report.
data: ls_data type z_my_structure.
parameters: comp1 like ls_data-comp1,
            comp2 like ls_data-comp2.
This does not: comp2 is empty and never updated automatically.
report z_my_report.
data: ls_data type z_my_structure.
parameters: comp1 like ls_data-comp1 as listbox visible length 30 user-command c1,
            comp2 like ls_data-comp2 as listbox visible length 30 user-command c2.
What is the command to refresh the listbox comp2 with values from it's search help based on the parameters (e.g. in at selection screen after comp1 was selected)?Best regards,Martin
The elementary search help assigned to comp2 has 1 import parameter (assigned to comp1) and 2 export parameters (key and text). The dialog type is "Display values immeditately".By debugging I found out that the listbox is just filled once at the initialization of the report and the value of comp1 is not copied to the SHLP_DESCR-INTERFACE-VALUE (as done before clicking the search help button).
I added this code to make it work. Isn't there an easier solution?
Hi everyone,
I'm currently learning SAP SuccessFactors Onboarding (former ONB 2.0) and need your help, please.
Chapter 5 "Additional Data Collection" describes a process that I can't do in the demo system. It is about "procedure to Create a Business Rule to make External Users Visible in Metadata Framework".
Especially: 
4. Click Details associated with mdfSystemExternalUserVisibility field
5. Select Editable from the dropdown menu for Visibility
--> I can't set to "editable" because the system displays an error message: 
"It is not authorized to change visibility of mdfsystemExternalUserVisibility to Editable, as this a system field."
I can't (therefore) perform the following step:
"12. Set the Then condition as mdfSystemExternalUserVisibility to be equal to Yes."
--> mdfSystemExternalUserVisibility does not appear at all, I can not select it.
And this step will also be necessary on the next pages.
What can I do? Where is the error?
Thank you and best regards,
Dilek
Hi Dilek Gündogdu ,
You are looking at the procedure and not the exercise correct? 
That is actually one way to configure the visibility of a custom object created for the Additional Data Collection step in the Onboarding process. An easier method to look at is available on the course and for this: Please follow the lengthy exercise instead. 
The whole exercise will give you a very good picture of what is needed for the "whole/full configuration" of the Additional Data Collection Step from beginning to end as it requires multiple procedures not just steps. 
If you have any further questions on the content, please feel free to tag me on your next response but it is great that it appears you have a demo instance to work with to apply what you are learning from the course using the exercises. 
Best regards,
Mark
Hi Dilek Gündogdu ,
That is great you have gone through the whole course which means you have gone through or saw the Exercise 8 (Create Custom MDF Objects for Additional Data Collection) in Unit 5. This was what I meant that you follow to experience the end-to-end configuration of the Additional Data Collection step. 
I just tested the procedure you followed now and it works fine on the custom objects I created for a demo instance I have. This is the same procedure from the implementation guide. 
It is possible that the object you may have selected is a predefined MDF object in the system that is why it may give an error of you cannot change it as a system hard-coded field. Can you maybe share which or what MDF object you selected to change the mdfSystemExernalUserVisibility field properties on? I can look into it further. 
But ultimately, this is just one of the methods to control the visibility of custom MDF objects to users like new hires and internal hires for the additional data collection step since we have multiple tools that configures any MDF objects in SuccessFactors. We use Manage Data and Business Rules tools as another way to configure this. This can be a bit confusing when it comes to MDF objects in general in SF but I hope the exercise clarifies the best way to configure the Additional Data Collection step in Onboardign for you.
If you have time, go through the exercise please rather than the procedures on the units. 
Kind regards,Mark

Can someone please help me out where can i find the SAP HANA XS ADVANCED Cockpit page URL for my cloud foundry HANA service.
Hi Srikanth,
"cloud foundry HANA service" does not exist. 
We have 
These services do not include an XS Advanced environment (and hence no admin cockpit URL). 
You can think of XSA as a Cloud Foundry distribution bundled with SAP HANA. Cloud Foundry is also hosted on the SAP Cloud Foundry as separate service (application runtime), hence it is not available as part of another service (the database). Make sense? 
On the topic, you might find this blog of interest
Good question. 
The XS classic environment (unrelated to Cloud Foundry) is included with the SAP HANA Service but not SAP HANA Cloud. When the XS classic environment is enabled, the tool to use would be the XS Classic Administration tool. This is documented for the platform but not for the service. 
There are different versions of the SAP HANA Service so you would first need to check whether the XS environment is up and running. The path to the tool is /sap/hana/xs/admin/ and requires access grants. See section 4 about how to set this up
Hi Srikanth 
Did you try this command  as below 

Generally URL should be https://hxehost:51044 
Command 

xs apps | grep xsa-cockpit
Let me know if that helped.

Hi guys,
I work as BASIS administrator and I just want to know what certifications I can take? With cloud technology nowadays like AWS, Azure, Google, etc., I need to upskill myself. I already have the below certifications:
C_HANATEC_17 - SAP HANA 2.0 SPS05
C_SM100_7210 - SAP Solution Manager - Mandatory and Managed System Configuration (7.2 SPS10) 
C_TADM55A_75 - System Administration (SAP HANA) with SAP NetWeaver 7.5 
There is BTP now and I would like to take certifications related to it. What path should I take?
Dear Philip!
My 2-cents worth:
The best source will be the 
SAP learning journeys overview:
Learning Journeys - Overview (sap.com)
A good starter might be the learning journey
Basics of SAP BTP Learning Journey: Basics of SAP BTP
Then e.g. 
DevOps with SAP BTP Learning Journey: DevOps with SAP BTP
Continuous Integration and Delivery by SAP Learning Journey: Continuous Integration and Delivery by SAP
etc.
Hint: Configure the learning journeys for your role "Administrator".
Have a look at them and you will find also the relevant certification. Not every and each learning journey results in a certification, but every and each certification is part of a learning journey.
First the knowledge you need for your job and then the adequate certification as an evidence...
BR
Walter
Hi Philip,
If you already have those certifications can look at what else interests, you in this list.
https://training.sap.com/certification/validity?keepQueryParams=1&keepRequestMethod=1
Using CER006 subscription is a good method to get and do proctored exams at a recent cost.
Other than maybe focus on a non-sap specific skill that you can use as a Basis consultant i.e. I am doing Python at the moment. To automate a lot of stuff including maintenance activities.

We are using CR SP 33 embedded in a Visual Studio Windows desktop app. When the server was a Windows 10 machine there were no problems, but after we recently moved to Windows Server 2019 all the reports and exports stop with Logon Failed, but only the very first time after the app has been loaded. After that, every report and export will work, until the app is closed and we sign back in again.
I've tried every permutation in the Viewer code, but I'm sure that there is nothing wrong with the code because a) it worked with a Windows 10 server, and b) it works ok now after the initial fail. Is there an issue with CR and Windows Server 2019?
Thank you
Geoffrey Pigott
There could be several potential causes for this issue. The first thing I would suggest is to check the Windows Event Viewer to see if any errors are being logged when the Crystal Reports Viewer attempts to logon to the server. Additionally, it is possible that the Windows Server 2019 is configured differently than the previous Windows 10 server and may require additional permissions/configurations to allow the Crystal Reports Viewer to access the server. I would also suggest checking the server's security settings to ensure that the appropriate access is being granted.
Other things that should be checked:
Thank you both for your comments. I will look into these suggestions
I have finally solved this problem after several weeks of trying every suggestion that I found via Google.
As Yogananda said, Windows Server 2019 is configured differently, and the fix is to go to Microsoft SQL Server 2019 on the server, SQL Server 2019 Configuration Manager, SQL Server Network Configuration, click on your Protocol, and disable TCP/IP. I also disabled Shared Memory. It would seem that only Named Pipes is needed.
What was apparently happening is that Crystal Reports initially tries to use TCP/IP, which fails, and after that it resorts to Named Pipes, which works ok until the app is closed down and restarted.
Again, thank you both for your help.
Hi. 
Not sure of your setup.
But if your code is using a windows service, with a user logon. Maybe consider a delayed start of that service.

Hello,
I'm getting such a dump in the program, how can I solve it ?

Hello Tugba Fidan
You are trying to modify read-only field(s). Hence the dump. I guess it's a custom program, so it's all but impossible to tell more without knowing the code.
Best regards
Dominik Tylczynski
Check if your internal table definition, the field catalog and the grid layout option are matching, e.g. selection mode, field (box) for selection in record of itab, etc. 
Try the Consistency Check of your ALV grid if you can display the grid.
As Raymond Giuseppi suggested this dump occurs when you fill OO ALV's "is_layout" structures "style" field or similar fields with a field name but that field does not exist at your "it_outtab" table.
Delete your program ;-)

While looping Internal table into Work Area it is fetching record one after another but while using for all entries in a selct statement and in where condition it is taking only last variable of a internal table.


I taw I taw an obsolete header line... :D
Whatever, it just means that from 2 lines in IT_FTAX_DATA (whatever it contains, only you can know), only one line corresponds in the database table BUT000 (we don't have access to your system, so we can't check the data in the table).
If you want to be helped, please show the values in IT_FTAX_DATA, the relevant lines in the database table BUT000, the actual result in GT_BUT000 and explain the result you expect and why.
Cannot start the ABAP instance. Executing R3trans -d and seeing trans.log it says SQL10 authentication failed. Could it be because when I ran the system copy and defined parameters in SWPM, I defined the schema to be SAPSMD instead of the source SCHEMA which is SAPSMP. What do you think is the issue? The system copy was interrupted a few minutes after SWPM executed the actual system copy (after defining the parameters).

1. Make sure after the interrupted copy that your kernel directories are completed and contains the same versions of libraries and all necessary libraries. If you see inconsistencies. You may need to have to re-extract your kernel in the kernel directories. 
2. Make sure your HANA Client is correct version, correct permissions and extracted correctly for location /usr/sap/EEP/hdbclient.
3. Also when viewing log of R3trans it is trying to connect to localhost, is your APP and HANA DB on same host? I doubt it which means this is part of your problem. Should have hostname/I.P. of your HANA database server.
4. Here is the key in the in the log:

Use the following SAP notes please.

Hi,

i am posting a goods receipt through VL32n against the inbound delivery EL . The item category is ELN . The document flow is updated as confirmation of service done . But the inventory does not change and neither any material document is posted . If I post a MIGO against the inbound delivery , the po history is updated with material docment number . Please let me know why I am not able to post the goods receipt through VL32n.

Regards,
Amol
Hi Dhas,

Inbound delivery is nothing but the only and on;y confirmation from vendor or you can say its just the goods from vendor entered in our premises.

So actual quantity check is done before MIGO.

Here in MIGO is the final confiramation of goods receipt where all aacounting entries are passed on and inventory along with value is updated in your system.

Hope you will understand in doubt pls revertr back.

Thanks and regards

I tried using the recording function to capture the element and then doing the .text at the end, but I keep getting errors every time. This is the code below with the two elements I am trying to grab text from. I am able to click on the elements but not store their texts. Am I doing this correctly? If so please let me know the correction. I have also attached two images of the two elements I am trying to store the text for.
storage_bin_1 = session.findById("wnd[0]/usr/shell/shellcont[1]/shell/shellcont[0]/shell").textstorage_bin_2 = session.findById("wnd[0]/usr/ctxt/SCWM/LAGP-LGPLA").textprint(storage_bin_1)print(storage_bin_2)
Hello John Do,
welcome in the SAP Community.
Your approach to store storage_bin_2 is correct. Here an example with WSH. Whether Python or WSH is used here makes no difference. The use of the SAP GUI Scripting API is independent of the programming language.

To read a cell from a grid you need the column name. You can see an example below how to detect it (line 6 and with the index of Columns you can detect the name, line 11).
With that column name you can read the content of a cell with GetCellValue method (line 15).

You can see in the last line of the console the result AA of the selected line in the grid.

Dear community,
we have activated the "Patch-Level Independent Bootstrap" management in our production system with the 1.96 version of SAPUI5.
Today we noticed that patch 1.96.17 has been released but it generates errors in handling bindings only on smartphones.
We have disabled automatic patching for now.
Here 2 examples:

Example Version 1.96.17 (Not working correctly)
Example Version 1.96.16 (Working correctly)

How to reproduce the case:

Change the number of the input field
Press the "Show number" button
Version 1.96.16 the entered number is shown correctlyVersion 1.96.17 the original number is shown and not the number entered by the user

This is most probably related to https://github.com/SAP/openui5/issues/3696.
The fix is already merged in UI5 version 1.111 and above: https://github.com/SAP/openui5/commit/26d728a207e94a8509d6b17c594be08f683cbcfc
But it's not downported to 1.96 yet. I already asked in the GH issue for a downport. But you might want to create a new issue since it's urgent.
why people down vote my reply??
check this note by yourself.

Hi Fiori Guru,
On Fiori's Maintenance Notification App, there is a field "techical object" which covers both Funcational location and Equipment. 
In SAP, Funcational location is set as mandatory only. 
On Fiori, "technical object" is not mandatory, which can result in the field being empty when notificatioin is created. 

How can it be set required on Fiori?
Thank you so much,
Sally
Hi sally,
I'm face same problem would you please share your solution.

Our developer told me it is standard in Fiori and can not change.
Dear FM Gurus,
I need your help. I have 1,000 released budget. Then I run transaction for FM Budget Return through FMBB with 1,000. 
- If I check as prepost or check document, no errors detected. Then I am able to prepost a document. However, I when post the document, it issues the message Annual budget exceeded by period 01 for -1,000 Message no. FMAVC002. Now when I check as prepost or check document, it generates the same error.
- If I post the return right away, it is successful since no errors detected at the beginning.
Is there anything in the AVC config that affects this process?

As you have confirmed that the model is storing the number with 7 decimals intact, it looks like an issue of display in story. Just check if there are some story level formatting. If not I would suggest you raise an incident with SAP.
Nikhil
The Measure-based Model was set with 7 Decimals 
In the Styling Panel I the decimals were also set to 7.
BUT
As I also have an Account Dimension it also neccessary to set the Decimals to 7.

local_to_utc(‘2014.02.01 00:00:00’, ‘UTC+08:30’) = ‘2014.01.31 15:30:00’My question is regarding the time of the year when DST switch happens, and the day has 25 hours... will this function still work and how?
Hello everyone,
I have already formulated the problem in the following question:
Since I have not yet come to a solution, I wanted to describe the error again in more detail.
As already outlined, the basic problem is an "Internal Server Error" after calling a deployed CAP project + UI with a managed approuter via the HTML5 app repository. 
After a detailed analysis, it turned out that the same error occurs when you change the destination ID (which is present in the URL). Which suggests that there might be an error in the attachment or reaching the destination. 
However, since I could not find any error here, here is the renewed question to the community. 
(The deployed service works, the database structure is deployed correctly and the UI works when tested locally in BAS).
Maybe one of you has an idea where the problem could come from. For a better understanding, below I listed the main files as well as the project structure:

Have you ever looked into the logs of the HTML5 app. I see there the following issue:
GET request to /5c277a67-144e-44b3-ad63-e08fec501d30.userParamManage.project1-0.0.1 completed with status 500 Application does not have xs-app.json
I would suggest you check the build process of your UI5 app.
Hi Parth Budhiraja,
for me, the problem was that the "xs-app.json" was not copied to the build folder (after the application was build). This was due to a mistake in the ui5.yaml (ui5-deploy.yaml). 
To be honest, I don't remember what the actual problem was. But if you like, you can post both files and I will take a look at it.
Hope this helps you. Have a nice day!
Best regards

Hi experts,
We have a UI5 App that needs to consume on premise SAP Gateway OData services exposed through a cloud connector. The authentication to this service is with principal propagation so the destination to be used is configured as such.
Can this UI5 App be tested from SAP BAS? Is the user logged on SAP BAS the one that is sent to the backend? Is the call gonna go through the clou connector?
Thanks in advance!
M.
If you're using the same Identity Provider in BAS as for the deployed app yes.
Hi, 
I'm facing a problem when using a 
SELECT (some colums) INTO new_table FROM old_table WHERE (time from and time to)
fixed query on Microsoft SQL in SAP MII workbench. 
The problem is that the old_table assumes to be too big (60.000 rows) and the query in workbench takes 100 sec. I also tried to use a stored procedure call, but this takes also 100 sec. Strange thing is that when I call this same query on the sql server directly ( in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio) the query only takes 3sec.
Do you have an idea how to speed things up or why the query on workbench side takes so long cause I dont get anything back, I just want to create the table on sql server.
Thanks for help!
Get a DBA to analyze the from table to see if there is an issue with Indexing.  Same thing with the To table.  I have occasionally run into slower performance from an external query against a database.  Beyond that, you would probably have to share the query and the structure of the two tables.
Hey developers!
Actually I try to add higher data volumes directly to a Azure based MSSQL database. I am aware that SAP Data Intelligence (cloud) doesn't support direct database loading (except SAP HANA and BigQuery) and we try two different approaches.
One approach is convertig the payload into prepared INSERT statements for the Flowagent SQL Executor. Therefore we are limited to a maximum of 512 statements per operator call or magically limited to a single INSERT maximum size of a prepared statement ... VALUES(). Generally I wonder whether this is really the best practice for working with defaul operators in SAP Data Intelligence? And this approach actually has a sweet spot of seperating in different prepared SQL statements which aren't too large.
The second approach would be using a custom operator based on pyodb or pymssql. Both are far away from functional. I created a dockerfile for pyodbc including the ODBC operator but while refering to the dockerfile its still not possible to link the ODBC driver for calling it in the python script. The second library pymssql seems to be stranger because we constantly receive a 'not sufficient memory' error.
Has anyone any recommendations, examples or best practices? I know, especially for databases, every database has its own specifica. But it seems harder than excpected to simply write larger datasets to a database.
Best regards,
Marcel
Hi team, 
I'm trying to get some text values from a web page. I first used the "Get Element" Activity from the Core SDK, but it is not working. I also used the "Get Property Element," but the same happened. I checked if I have the WEB SDK in my dependencies, and it is there. But when I see the tags from the activities, I don't see any related to WEB. I see core, outlook, and excel. Am I missing any activities that could help me get text values from this web page? 

I updated the WEB and CORE SDKs to the last release, trying to fix the issue. But now, I can't find the "Get Element" And "Get Property Element" activities anymore. So I don't see any activities that could help me get the text values. 
Do you know how to show the WEB activities? Or tell me which activity would help me get the text. 
This is the current state of this step in the automation:

Any help would be highly appreciated.

Hi, I am looking for some guide that describes how to buy subscription for SAP Cloud for Customer? There is no proper documentation on that. I want to have an account for SAP Cloud for Customer. There is no sign up interface for it. I am new to SAP platform. I am very disappointed to see there is no guide or documentation on it.How to set up administrator account?

Do you have an overview in which cases the implementation / usage of a blockchain in companies makes sense and when not?
Hi Dennis,
the main advantages of Blockchain are of course the immutability of the ledger (which is secured by cryptographically sound algorithms), reliability (the decentralized structure functions like a backup) and privacy (normally, Blockchains are anonymous, but this can also be implemented differently). This is just generally speaking, as there are a lot of different Blockchain Technologies that always do things differently. 
The disadvantages of Blockchain are (I am speaking here generally again) speed of transaction in some cases, the high computing power needed for "proof of work" based systems and the amount of storage needed for a truly decentralized system.
So if we think about usecases, we need to think about the data that will be stored in the Blockchain. For a Blockchain to make financial and logical sense from a business perspective, the data that is stored in the Blockchain needs to be of high value to a company. If the requirement for the data is to be stored securely and immutably as well as have a backup, Blockchain might make sense.
As you probably know, the most famous usecase is in the financial sector. But Blockchain could also make sense for the Tracking and Tracing of Pharmaceuticals, or for tracking a supply chain in general. The decentralized structure also makes it easy for suppliers to join the network. Another usecase is for business networks, where different companies need access to the same data. In this case, the decentralized ownership of the network is the biggest advantage, as companies dont have to trust each other in order to verify the validity of the chain.
So to sum up: If the data
Blockchain might make sense.
If the data is only stored with a single enterprise and does not need to be decentralized, but it still needs all the other features, you could look at the
These technologies also look very promising, as most companies who think they need a Blockchain don't actually need one.
I hope this helps.
In fact, when a technology becomes popular, a lot of effort is put into using it for different applications.
 @Dennis Streichertt Blockchain is a distributed immutable transaction ledger and can be used where you need to maintain privacy, decentralized, track of records, and no authority will be involved .
Hi Dennis,
for me it has always made sense, convincing others has been much more difficult but retiring blockchain services from SAP trial account does not make any sense to me at all.

Hi, 
so many use cases but I would say the biggest is in the Supply Chain Management for traceability, transparency, tradeability, counterfeiting and so on. 
BR
Blockchain is a powerful technology with a lot of potential for companies looking to improve their processes and increase transparency. However, it's important to consider the specific use case and whether or not the blockchain is the best solution for that particular problem.If you're looking to learn more about when blockchain makes sense for companies, you may want to check out this helpful link: https://fbs.com/analytics/tips/easy-scalping-strategies-26412. It provides a great overview of blockchain's different use cases and benefits for businesses. As with any technology, it's important to do your research and consider all factors before deciding whether or not to implement it. Best of luck in your blockchain journey!

There is a column in the Material Documents Overview called "Stock Change (List)." Some records show a value in that column of "No Stock Changes", yet the same record includes a transaction quantity. That doesn't compute. Why would a record showing transaction quantity also indicate "No Stock Changes"?
Can someone help me understand this?
Thanks,
Ralph

Hello Ralph Abraham,
One of the reasons why the column "Stock Change (List) is showing you "No Stock Changes", and a Transaction Quantity at the same time could be because of the nature of the Material Type or even the Movement Type that your are using. 
For example if you use a "HAWA" Material Type, the materials are received within your Plant, but it goes directly to a consumption account, so this will not affect directly your Inventory, or can be posted against a Project. Another example is the Goods Receipt for Purchase Order for SERV Materials (Services), where you will see the quantity in your Material Document reports, but the Stock Change within your Plant/Storage Location is not affected.
Within the Movement Type example, if you block the usage of the material, from Unrestricted to Restricted stock, this will create a Material Document to reflect the movement, but this will no impact the quantity of the stock within your plant.
Hope this clarifies a little bit, feel free to share a screenshot or provide more details in case is needed.

Gabriel
Hello,


We are currently running the standard google Ads integration between google and SAP Marketing Cloud via CPI.


Currently the behavior is as follows. The master google account (MCC) is stored in the CPI. Via the SMC you can now select the corresponding sub-accounts and transfer the data from the SMC via the campaign to the sub-account.


 


However, we would like to transfer the data to the main account, i.e. to the MMC. How can this be realized? Why? Because the customer wants to distribute the handed over target group to one or more sub-accounts of the google MCC account (and not creating 10 SMC campaigns for 10 sub-accounts.


 


Many thanks for any ideas, Best regards, Stefan
Hi Stefan,
Thank you for reaching out. In SAP Marketing Cloud, transferring audience is restricted to the Google Ads sub account. We don't have the provision to transfer SMC Target groups to the Google Ads Manager account (MCC).

In the Third-party sales process, Whenever posting customer invoices. It is posted twice. It is not restricting or checking whether the same order qty is already invoiced or not.
After Analysing the issue, we found that MIRO is posted twice ,because of that it is allowing customer invoice posting twice due to billing relevance F in the Item category TAS.
Can you please suggest how to restrict the customer invoice not to post twice though the MIRO is posted twice?
With Regards
Samarendra Sahoo
You can restrict duplicate invoice posting on the vendor side by maintaining the required control via FK02 for that Vendor or in SPRO > MM > Set Check for Duplicate Invoices
Hello https://people.sap.com/samarendra01,
Please check completion rule in item category TAS. If it's not defined then define and check. Also set duplicate invoice check from vendor side as suggested by above answer.

Dear Experts,
We are using SAP Business One 9.3 HANA PL10.
Is it possible to block any stock movements (i.e documents "Stock Transfer", "Issue for Production", "Receipt from Production") for users that are NOT assigned to a particular warehouse. 

For example, if we assign a Storekeeper for warehouse WH01. Another storekeeper for warehouse WH02, cannot make any stock transactions with WH01 without Storekeeper WH01s knowledge. 
For "Stock Transfer", I have added an approvement process with this query:
SELECT distinct 'true' FROM OWTR T0 WHERE $[OWTR."Filler"]= '01' AND $[OWTR."ToWhsCode"]= '02'
So, if Storekeeper of WH02 tries to move stock from WH01, Storekeeper of WH01 gets to approve this. But this is at the header level, not at the row level. 
The approvement fails to work at the row level (WTR1."FromWhsCod" and WTR1."WhsCode") 
What other solutions exist for blocking all stock movements?
Thank you,Shak
Hi,
Approval procedure will work only on header level not on row level. This is standard system behavior.
Regards,
Nagarajan
Dear Please put three transaction notification for stop stock movements
1.Stock Transfer
2.Issue For Production
3.Receipt from production
Thanks

Hi there, 
I am looking to find the field "storekeeper" but can't reach it. Which localization are you using? 
Hi all,
I am getting an error when using the REUSE_ALV_GRID_DISPLAY_LVC function. The program displays the ALV OK but, if a do a F4 (Matchcode) on a particular column, the program dumps with a message (GETWA_NOT_ASSIGNED). The dump seems to suggest an unassigned field symbol in a system program (CL_GUI_ALV_GRID).
The ALV has some editable columns (as check boxes). If I disable the edit value in the field catalog the F4 works OK. As far as I can check, the field catalog values are the same in both cases (excepting the edit allowed column, of course).
The REUSE_ALV function is as follows:
  CALL FUNCTION 'REUSE_ALV_GRID_DISPLAY_LVC'    EXPORTING      i_callback_program       = gv_repid      i_callback_user_command  = 'USER_COMMAND'      i_callback_pf_status_set = 'SET_PF_STATUS'      is_layout_lvc            = w_layout      it_fieldcat_lvc          = i_fieldcat      i_save                   = 'A' "permite salvar el layout    TABLES      t_outtab                 = gt_alv    EXCEPTIONS      program_error            = 1      OTHERS             = 2.

Hello SAP Partner Community, Our client needs to see the fails from the HRIS Sync. While the sync notifies on the number of successes, it does not provide information for the fails. This information is needed to determine where are the issues and fix accordingly. Employee Profile fields have been used for RBP set up. The client needs to do sync between the Employee Central data and the Employee Profile. If this fails, they will be unable to find the fails which would in turn has an impact on RBP. Having the HRIS Sync failing will impact the data loads. In brief, the client would like to check on the HRIS Sync report to get a list of all the users for whom the Sync job fails whenever the HRIS Sync job is run in the system. Is there a way to do a compare between the import and the data after the sync runs? Do any of you have ideas on how to get to see the fails? Any previous experience with this? Ideas for a workaround? 

Thanks in advanced, 
Carolina Rojas.
In the provisioning job you can always add emails to be informed about when it's ran at least, but the best place to check (for now) by my understanding is still provisioning (as a partner). You can also see the details in scheduled job manager until some extent, I personally hope they will make a hyperlinked details (for extra) details soon. Other then that I'm not aware of any other option.
Hi Jasper, Thank you for the answer. The issue is that if it fails of 1 or 8,000 the Client needs to know who that user is to adjust accordingly. We need to identify a way to troubleshoot the fails. Carolina. 
Dear SAP,
When checking a storage bin in the Warehouse Monitor APP, the storage bin doesn't have stock and it's not tagged as an "Empty Storage Bin". 
What is possibly happening?
Thank you.
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
Dear Community,
This could be related that you have an open WT or open physical inventory document related to that storage bin. Or also the storage types of these bins have the flag 'No capacity update' set in customizing 'Define Define Storage Types'. 
You can use the checkbox 'No Capacity Update' to prevent the update of capacity data, number of handling units (HUs), and empty status, thereby preventing the database lock. This allows you to eliminate wait times. As a result, the occupied weight, volume, free capacity, number of HUs, and empty status are not updated for the storage bins of the specified storage type. 
Because of that even if the stock of the storage bin you are checking is empty, the flag 'Empty Storage Bin' is not going to be flagged. 
Best regards,
SAP Support

I've been trying to use the "Build a Micro App for SAP Mobile Cards" booster in SAP BTP without success. 
During step 2, when I enter my subaccount and space the service is detected as uninitialized, despite the initialization has already been done from the Mobile Service cockpit. When I proceed with clicking on the Initialize Mobile Card button, I receive the error message "No organization exists".
About the environment: I'm on a productive global account where I created a demo CF subaccount with my corporate identity provider installed. I've performed the activities described in this tutorial, and was able activate the service/register the client without any issues.
Am I missing something?

I am facing the same issue.
I got same problem. too..ㅠ.ㅠ
Same issue here. Any update?
I don't know what's the source reason, but this also happened in the past in some other mobile related tutorial. 
Hi Experts,
I am having an error while creating the service entry sheet on S4HANA CLOUD. At the time of adding a line item, it shows me 2 errors -
1. Enter a valid purchase order item. 00010 is not valid. and I only put 10 instead 00010 still it shows me this error one more thing is that when I F4 on Purchase order item 00010 is showing and after selecting it, It shows me an error 


2. In Error 2 - Purchase order item 00010 contains delivery costs.
Diagnosis
You cannot add a purchase order item of product type group Service to a service entry sheet if delivery costs were defined for this item.
Procedure
Choose a valid purchase order item. If you add a purchase order item by using the value help, you can filter the hit list by unselecting the flag Show Invalid Items. This way, you ensure that only purchase order items are displayed that are valid for service entry sheets.
Message no. MM_PUR_SES207

Hi experts!
I'm facing an issue during the content catalog synchronization. I have a parent catalog and a child (country-specific) one (to give you an example, a structure is like this: contentCatalogEU -> contentCatalogFR).
I've created some pages in the country-specific catalog, having their Page Template belonging to the parent catalog.
When I synchronize the country-specific catalog from Staged to Online version, I've noticed that all the Page Templates of these pages still refers to the Staged Ones.
Do you know why this happens? 
Thank you.
I figured out the problem: I had to configure the "Depends on sync" attribute in the country-specific sync properties by adding the parent sync catalog job.
I faced the same issue, I solved it by adding the necessary Sync attribute config
Hi all,
I would like to generate a report using ESTDH which shows SDS in "Completed" status highlighted in yellow below. I´m using W6 as Report Status code in ESTDH, however W6 is showing Completed SDSs and some already released SDSs.
Is there a Report Status code that returns SDS in "Completed" status only?

Thanks.
Igor
Hello Igor,
only W6 should be status completed, whereas W7 should be status released. Are you sure your status network is set up correctly? 
Ralph
Hi Ralph,
How to check status network setup?
Thanks 
Igor
Hello
in the SAP standard is techical value "W6" is assigned to the status "completed"; W7 is "released". You should not change that.
Between "W6" and "W7" you can add customer specific status
In the generation variant you define the "first" status which is "relevant" from user perspective. Normally you use "Completed" here; but you can change that to "Released".
If you use then CG02 you should get only "Released" documents in CG50. There are some exemptions. Examples are: e.g. phrase is not translated, potential other status are "System Error" etc.
Using transaction CG50 you can display the generated report "ignoring" the status. In Transaction CG54 you will see only "Released" reports (and "historic reports as well"). Only "Released" reports do have a value in the subsequent processes.
The "Status net" is explained e.g. here:
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/ff6d35a34fbe4bea99e4ac41b0d5db03/bba4ce5314894208e10000000a174cb4.html?locale=en-US
An example you find here:
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/ff6d35a34fbe4bea99e4ac41b0d5db03/bea4ce5314894208e10000000a174cb4.html?locale=en-US
C.B.
PS: the "status net" etc. is defined in customizing. 
Hi all,
Thanks for the comments.
Let me rephrase.
I generate SDSs in CG02 and I expect to put Report Status = W6 in ESTDH and get a table that shows what is actually in W6 status, however I´m getting some records that were W6 few months ago but they are not W6 anymore today, they are W7 or even rejected by the user, so I have to go GC50 to check what is really W6.
Thanks.
Igor
Hello
a.) if the user "reject" a "prepared" report in CG50: next day you will not see this any more in the user interface
b.) If you start with CG02 you can "select" the status of the report ot be displayed (e.g. "generation with warning" etc.)
c.) if you start using CG50 you can do the same: So in the user interface there is an option to select the "status". Here you can define whatever kind of "list". If you select: show only thos which are "completed": this is a natural option of transaction CG50... PLease check the SAP online help

Hello,
I have a few issues below if someone would please help.
1. In LS26, there is an unrestricted quantity of 41 rolls in 922, but I don't see the quantity is in any other bin. 
2. In LS26, another batch has an unrestricted quantity of 503 rolls in 922, and quantity of (negative 247) -247 rolls in 999 bin. The correct quantity to post is 256. How do I clear this out of 922?
Your help is greatly appreciated. Time is essence on this issue.
Thank you
TN
Hello Thuy Nguyen
You can clear those quants just be moving stock between storage bins in 922 and 999 with LT01 transaction. When you move a positive stock quantity to a negative quant, they will be cleared. But I am not able to give precise instruction as it depends on the actual situation on the warehouse floor.

Hi all.

Is there a way, maybe a function, to set the master role of a single role?
Fill the "Derive from role" field.

I mean, other than a direct UPDATE AGR_DEFINE .... which works, btw
I would prefer a "lawful" method.

Any hint?

As an alternative also the creation of a new role with the master role set.

My current method is to create the roles via PRGN_RFC_CREATE_ACTIVITY_GROUP and then use SECATT to set the master and do other things.



Thank you
Check FM S_AUTH_CREATE_AGR whether it fulfills your requirement.

How to Disable the Standard Field 'Attachment' Item Text in ME51N/ME52N .Please find the attachment .When creating PR ,when we create attachment ,Some custom text is getting auto populated already but in editable mode .Users are able to change it .So, to avoid that ,when we create attachment , the Standard Field 'Attachment' Item Text in ME51N/ME52N should be greyed out and user shouldn't be able to edit it .Please let me know how to do we achieve it . Thanks in advance .

Hi,
please check your text control customizing
SPRO > MM > Purchasing > Purchase Order > Texts for Purchase Orders > Define Text Types for Header Texts
see sap note 448814
As 'Before Attachment of a document in GOS while creating PR(ME51N)/Changing PR(ME52N) its in editable mode ,The Business requirement is to grey out the field text', Customizing is not an option.
Have you already looked at the BAdI ME_PROCESS_REQ_CUST methods (but with little hope, as the GOS is sort of "isolated" from the main transaction. 
So I'm afraid you'll have to debug the code, and look into the PBO of the long text type list display, check values of itab GT_CONTROL-TEXTTYPES)
Hi All,
In one of Business requirement we need send SAC story data to user over email using Schedule Publication function in SAC. But Publication option is not visible in out tenant.
Per one of Blog, we found this option is only available for US10 (AWS) data center for US region, But this blog is almost 2 years old - Is it still same? in US region only US10 is supporting scheduling option or US02 is now supporting as well?

We have checked all authorization and number of licenses (25+) as well but still not getting schedule publication option in SAC.
If any one have any information on this then please share with me.
Thanks,

schedule publication functionality is only available on CF(Cloud Foundry) tenants and there were no other plans.
As far as i know, US02 - Neo tenant.
Hi Girish Lakhani ,
The blog still holds good. Check with your SAC admin if publication is configured and you have the access.

You should be able to simply change it to integer type before loading. See similar question and answer here: 
https://answers.sap.com/questions/13799953/file-load-with-boolean-values-in-sap-analytic.html
SAC attempts to auto-determine the data type based on the data being loaded, but you can always manually change it before loading the data.
Hi Peter,
Understand that we are able to manually change the data type before loading. Does it means by setting the measure data type to Integer doesn't help the system to auto detect number "1" as an integer? Kindly advise.
Thank you.
Best Regards,
Yanice
Hi Yanice,
In the data wrangling, you may alter the measure column's data type from Boolean to Integer or another data type. Based on the first few thousand records, SAC automatically determines the data type. Since your data is primarily 1 and 0, thus it recognises it as boolean.

Hello SAP sages,
This is an issue I've been struggling with for quite some time for multiple customers.
When creating a report (and subsequent Fiori tile) using the 'Manage KPIs and Reports' app, I want to have the ability to navigate from my report to another app or transaction. Cross App Navigation.
Below, for example, I have taken a standard Query from SAP (C_SlsOrdConfAnlytsQry) and made a report + KPI tile on top of this. In the app, to navigate to VA03 for sales order 60438. (This is just one example, I have many custom CDS views for which I want to be able to navigate to many different apps/transactions. It should also be possible to select multiple navigation targets here.)


I have selected the following Semantic object/action in my report:

In the tile:

This should be enough, no? Or is it necessary to create another target mapping in the launchpad designer?
This is what is created automatically in LPD in this case:

Added this target mapping in the same catalog but seems pointless:

Documentation from SAP in regard to configuring semantic object/action for this particular app is very lacking...
I am aware there are other solutions like this or this. But I want to use this Fiori app in particular in combination with Eclipse for the CDS, without having to rely on other software for cross app navigation.
If anybody could point me in the right direction, that would be great.
Hello SAP community, 
I'm currently encountering a strange error while trying to embedd an SAC story in an iframe on our on-premise crm system. 
I've enabled the trusted origin in the SAC and everything seems to be working, except that I don't get a CORS popup on the initial load, leading to an access error in the story itself.
However, when I click on the reload button within the story, the popup opens up as intended and I get access to the data. However this is obviously not practical for an embedded story. 
What could be the reason for this? Is it connected to the loading order of the webpage perhaps?
Problem solved: 
Needed to add the CRM System to the popup exceptions in chrome. Apparently on first load of the webpage, the popup exception rule for the iframce source system is used, however when pressind the reload button inside the SAC, the already in place SAC exception was used. 
I have a list of products and I want to print the details of a product. 
Does anyone know how to implement in Sap MDK?
You could look into creating a PDF containing the data you want to output.  There is a showcase app on our public samples repo you can look at.  There is also a showcase app for printing a QR code that perhaps you could adapt to print your PDF.
Hi everyone, 
I am trying to migrate BPs (customers or suppliers) with migration cockpit. 
For one of my BP groupings, I am using external numbering. 
I thus complete the column "Customer Number" of my template with the reference of my customer but when simulating the data, I receive this error message : 

I checked my settings in Nr ranges and BP groupings but everything seems ok. 
Have you already faced such an issue ? 
Kr,
Mathias
You could check couple of things:
- How is BPAB defined - only numbers or alpha-numeric?
- Could be a release upgrade issue - was this working before the upgrade? If yes, create a new project and see what happens.
Best,
Sandeep
Hi Mathias,
have you try a simulation first? and take a look on Sandeep's advice

Hi,
I created subaccount for Transport Mangament System Configuration in SAP Cloud Platform. I enabled Cloud Foundry Environment, created detsinations, servise plan etc.. But now i cannot see Security and Quota Plans Tabs.
In the Overview, it says "Cannot display information. You are not an org member." for Cloud Foundry Environment. But when i first created this subaccount , i could display them.
Is there any missing role? 

Normally it should be like that:

BR,
Nurhan
I think you need to be an admin of the global account to see these buttons/areas
Hi Nurjan and Geet (which has commented, informing that has the same issue).In order to see the Cloud Foundry tile, you must fulfill the following requisites:
You can also find details about this in 3082980 - "Cloud Foundry" tile is not shown in BTP SubaccountIn order to request access as Org Member, contact the Subaccount administrators.

Hello Experts,
I am working in a scenario wherein we have to migrate data from non-SAP to SAP S4HANA 2021.
I would like to understand whether Migration Cockpit and/ or Migration Object Modeler (LTMOM) has the capability to perform complex transformation, i.e. transformations where we have to refer multiple source tables or lookup tables to find the transformed value of a source field data.
OR, we have to use SAP BODS for complex data transformation ?
Your response is highly appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

If I start building a story in SAC and later down the line in development I realize that Ineed the toolkit of an analytic application to get where I want. Can I Change my story to an analytic application or do I have to start over?
TLDR:
Is it possible to convert a story to an analytic application in SAC?
Not possible!
Hello,
There are currently no plans to enable the conversion of a story to an analytic application.
The story cannot be transformed into an analytic application, but you can copy every widget from the story and put them one by one into the analytic application. Only widgets that the analytical program supports are pasted.

Still if you want this feature to be enable you can raise an enhancement request. So, that team will look and if they found the request valuable. They may implement in future.
Thanks,
Aayush.
Hi Sebastian,
This is not yet supported in SAC Analytics Cloud. 
However, in the coming QRC release (2023.3), you may now use the new Optimized Story Experience, which unifies features in both, stories and analytics designers, whether you were developing stories or analytic apps. Using a range of widgets, functions, and scripting features, you may design unique interactions and incorporate unique logic.
Visit Unifying Story and Analytic Application with the New Optimized Story Experience in SAP Analytics Cloud for more details.
Thanks,
Neelima
It's not possible to convert the story to an analytic application, but what you can do is you can copy all the widgets from the story and paste all the copied widgets into the analytic application. Only the widgets supported in analytic application are pasted. 
It will be possible after QRC2 2023 release (May 2023) because then stories are enhanced to receive the same scripting capability & analytical apps can be converted to story object.

Can anyone explain me the use of ABS statement.

Eg. f = abs(g).
camila,

ABS()--Means it will convert - sign to + sign
 
Ex : F1 = -100.
 
F2 = ABS ( f1 ).
Write : F2.

Ans: 100

Don't forget to reward if useful...
Hi
ABS statement gives the absolute value of any field
means if it is Negative it gives the positive value

Reward points for useful Answers
Regards
Anji
use to convert -ve to +ve or viseversa
Use ABS function or multiple it with minus 1 are same

f1 = ABS ( f1 ).
f1 = f1 * -1.
Hi Camila,

This statement returns the absolute value of the number g, ie f will contain the absolute value of g. Absolute value means the value without taking into consideration the sign.

For example, if g has the value -10, f will get the value 10.

Reward points if helpful.

Regards
Renuka
HI,

use to convert -ve to +ve or viseversa
Use ABS function or multiple it with minus 1 are same , which gives same result.

for ex: 
data a type i value -10.
a = ABS(a)
write a. o/p is 10

if helpful reward some points.

with regards,
suresh.
Hi all,

ABS like i.e. sign, ceil or trunc are so-called overloaded functions. That means that the type of the result is determined by the type of the argument.

When creating such functional methods using the class builder I learned that the RETURN parameter must be explicily typed. So my question is: Can you create overloaded functions with ABAP class builder?

TIA,

Regards,

Clemens
Hello, 
We are considering using the Decentralized Administration setting on a Compensation Template for one of our clients, however we are not sure about what disadvantages/issues could appear when using this setting.
From your experience with it, what are the disadvantages/risks we could run into if we decide to use the Decentralized Administration setting on a Compensation Template?

An asset is assigned to cost center A from 07 Jun 2022. From 17 Jul 2022 it is assigned to cost center B. The depreciation amount is posted to cost center B only for Jul 2022. Requirment from client is to post to both cost center A and B based on the day in interval. How can we deal with this requirement?I read the Notes 29947 but I cannot find any further documentation that can help me solve this requirement.Regards,Thuy.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
Depreciation amount is posted for the whole period via AFAB.
We understand you change cost center in the middle date of the period and want to split depreciation amount to old and new cost center during one posting period but this function does not support in standard system.
Hi SAP Community,
I would like to generate new data combinations through a data action in my model. I have multiple arrays that I pass to my data action. However, I do not want a cartesian product. I want to determine the position of each array element to define my data(). This is easily done in JavaScript:
for (var i = 0; i < testArray.length; i++) {
 var test = testArray[i].id; var test2 = testArray2[i].id;
}
Is the same not possible in my data action? From what I have understood in the documentation, I can only determine the position of the date dimension with NEXT() and PREVIOUS(). Is there nothing similar for other dimensions?
Thanks and kind regards,
Steffi
Steffi Chan
If you can explain the business case in little detail it will be easier to help. Advanced formula do not work on array concept but do support FOREACH and FOR to iterate. Using NEXT () and PREVIOUS () within FOREACH and FOR can help you generate records using DATA() statements. 
Hope this helps !!

Hi SAP Guys,
I want to create an incompleteness check about a condition typ. The challenge is, it should done via two selections criterias.
1) if the condition ZZZZ is not there ==> incomplete
2) if the condition ZZZZ is there but the value is 0 ==> incomplete
would be great if someone can give me an advice.
Thanks for your help.
Stephan
Go to v/06, select this condition type and set to "Automatic entry has priority" and also, in pricing procedure configuration, set this condition type as "Mandatory"
First check what item category is there in sale order.  Next go to vov7, select that item category and see what incompletion procedure is assigned.  Finally, go to OVA2, select that incompletion procedure and maintain VBAP-PRSOK
Now create a sale order and see whether you are able to save it
Hi there,

Hoping someone can help me - I think this is a fairly common issue but I'm not sure how to handle it in our configuration and would like to know how others are handling this scenario.

We have multiple HR personnel that are responsible for a group of employees. In our route map configuration, we want 'HR' to review performance and compensation forms after the employee completes it. However, we want the form to go into a 'bucket' that those HR personnel are all responsible for processing. The reason we want to do this is to avoid forms being stuck in the queue when people go on vacation, leave, etc. In our current configuration, we have created a specific user, assigned that user to the route map step, and then assigned proxy access to all our HR personnel so everyone can go in as the fake person and process the forms. Although we have assigned an HR Rep to each employee, I don't think we are leveraging this and perhaps, certain features of Success Factors.
Is there a better way to configure the route map to achieve the group 'bucket'? 
Hopefully, that is clear. Thanks in advance!
Sarah, 
I hope this helps -

You can modify the routing based on roles according to the latest help forms, so depending on how it's configured the admin would probably have to make the change depending on the rules. 
Note The following table lists all fields. Some fields don't apply to all steps and don't appear in the list for those steps.
Sara
Hi Sarah Mah 
in Compensation we recommend granting HR access to Executive Review (based on Role Based Permission and very granular) instead of trying to add them to a specific step of the workflow. 
This is because the compensation module is planner centric so employees on one worksheet for one planner could have different HR Managers and we can't split it from the worksheet they're in to send them to be approved by their HR and then bring them back. Hence Executive Review is way more handy because access can be granted based on the HR Job Relationship of EC.
All the best
Xavier
Hello Gurus!
I've seen a few posts on this topic but most have been unresolved or are slightly different than our requirement.
Here is a summary of our requirement and actions taken thus far:
1. KF1 exists at planning level PRODLOCCUST 
2. There are two LOCIDs 'A' and 'B'. If we enter forecast at PRODCUST level and add in LOCID attribute, we would like LOCID 'A' to get 100% of the disaggregation. Only if we deliberately enter the into LOCID 'B' at detailed level should there ever be a forecast there.
3. New key figure KF2 created at same planning level for intent to be used in disagg expression. This key figure is given value '1' for all combinations with LOCID 'A'. 
4. Now my key figure has Aggregation mode 'SUM', Disagg Mode: 'Equal distribution', Proportionality: 'Disaggregation Expression' and is marked calculated and stored.
My disaggregation expression is IF(KF2 = 1, "KF1", NULL). However, when I add in LOCID it still disaggregates % to the unwanted LOC ignoring the expression. Can anyone help point me in the right direction?
Thank you!
Z
Hello Zach Freitas
Based on the information you have provided you have done everything right. But still some % of forecast is going to a different location. the only possible reason is that somehow some old dissagg value is being respected.
First initialise the the KF so that all existing values in that KF is deleted. Then drop the forecast again at PRODCUST level and it will work. 
Incase it doesnt, then remove the calucation and makr the KF as stored only and repeat the above process.

Hello kind people,
I am trying to load FICO data from SAP to a Microsoft Data Warehouse. I want to recreate a Trial Balance in Microsoft, so I was thinking to take Life To Date journal entries. This led me to JDT1, which appears to have most of the data elements I am seeking. Problematically, however, I do not see Cost Center or WBS element anywhere on JDT1. I know these items are input when we create the Journal Entry. 
Can anyone help me figure out a good way to join Cost Center and WBS to JDT1? Or is there a better way to export a data set which shall be used to recreate Trial Balance and Financial Statement.
Thank you!
I am using BAPI_GOODSMEVEMNT_CRAETE in and OData _CREATE_ENTITY method .
I know this topic has been discussed number of times in the forum , but little confused .
The MATDOC number is getting generated in debugging but not in normal flow 
 .So I applied BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT .But it is still not working .
Hence I had to apply 
wait 3 secods .
Now it is working .
But is this the proper way? or we can use CAL DUNCTION IN UPDATE TASK 
or another proper way 
If you look inside BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT, it calls either COMMIT WORK or COMMIT WORK AND WAIT depending on the boolean input parameter WAIT.
One of the effects of COMMIT WORK is to call the update function modules registered to be run in the Update Task.
They will run asynchronously if you use COMMIT WORK, but "synchronously" if you use COMMIT WORK AND WAIT (that will wait for the end of all update function modules).
Waiting with WAIT UP TO x SECONDS is bad practice if it works well with COMMIT WORK AND WAIT.
You can use the WAIT Parameter of BAPI Commit, (as Sandra Rossi said) as following:
I am not sure what you mean. Are you calling BAPI from the Save Method of Behaviour implementation?
Do you have managed or unmanaged behaviour?
Anyway RAP will perform a commit after save, so it is not allowed to use Commit or RAISE Exceprion in the save method, but you can incapsulate you BAPI call in a function and call this function IN BACKGROUND TASK.
In this case you will be able to use commit there, but the function will be called in a separate transaction. That means you will not be able to update the RAP Modell with the result of BAPI call and in the same Save routine.
But you can add the EML code into the background function to update your model with MATDOC after BAPI call. User will have to refresh the page to see the result.
So I am using an extended save routine in my RAP and call from there a function in backgroud task
Inside of this function I am calling BAPI, BAPI COMMIT or ROLLBACK and updating Modell with the BAPI result





May be this will help you.
Good Day Everyone,
I am trying to create a table join and I'm having a hard time figuring out the Table name for payment due dates.
Table Name: INVFO
Field Name: NETDT
Data Element: NETDT
When I try to create a table using the table name: INVFO I get an error: "Direct read not possible for INVFO"
I'm trying to pull invoices by Purchase Order and include the due dates for payments in my query.Please advise if I'm missing something.
I've created other table joins to pull all purchase orders by IO#'s which includes: EKKO, EKPO, EKKN, LFA1, COAS. But this query does not include the payment due dates of posted invoices. 
Thank you
Kathleen
Hello Kathleen,
Can you specify how and from where are you trying to create the table and getting the message « Direct read not possible for INVFO"« ? And can you confirm it is a BW system running on database SAP ASE ? 
Thanks,
Best regards,
Victoria
It takes long time to load data from BW ON HANA TO SAC 
Hello,
There are multiple reasons why performance may be affected. It may be from Backend issue, Network Latency or system outage. The overall performance of SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) is mainly determined by the three components - client time (frontend), network time and the SAP Analytics Cloud service time (backend).
By using our Performance Analysis tool, you can identify the problematic parts of your scenario and see how much time is spent in which component (frontend, network, backend).
https://blogs.sap.com/2021/01/08/sap-analytics-cloud-performance-analysis-tool/
As mentioned, Only one user is affected by this issue. So we need HAR File or logs for that particular time when issue persist, so that we can trace and get to know about the root cause. We can not detect the cause or we can not check without HAR file or any logs for that particular time when issue persist.
If you face any issue please trace the HAR file so that we can trace the cause of the issue by follow this below KBA;

Is there a way to MASS update first & last name on VD02 "Contact Person" records?
Hi Experts,

Short text
 Call of a method or kernel Method that has not been implemented
What happened?
 Error in the ABAP Application Program

 The current ABAP program "CL_EX_GLT0_CLEARING_ITEMS=====CP" had to be
 terminated because it has
 come across a statement that unfortunately cannot be executed.
Error analysis
 An exception occurred that is explained in detail below.
 The exception, which is assigned to class 'CX_SY_DYN_CALL_ILLEGAL_METHOD', was
 not caught in
 procedure "IF_EX_GLT0_CLEARING_ITEMS~BADI_NEEDS_TRACE_DATA" "(METHOD)", nor was
 it propagated by a RAISING clause.
 Since the caller of the procedure could not have anticipated that the
 exception would occur, the current program is terminated.
 The reason for the exception is:
 It was tried to call a not-implemented method
 "IF_EX_GLT0_CLEARING_ITEMS~BADI_NEEDS_TRACE_DATA" in the class
 "CL_IM_FMFG_SPLBALANCING_AC".

 How can this occur?

 1. Implementation of Global Interfaces

 If a class implements a global interface, not all methods must be
 implemented. Then there will be no syntax error, but a warning at the
 implementing class. A runtime error only occurs when a not-implemented
 method is called. This is what happened here.

 How to resolve this issue?

subramanyam reddy

Hi All,
Apart from manually seraching the badi(if exists) for any userexit in SE84. 
Is there any table mainitaning the relationship for the replacement of userexits with badi. Or Any suggestion for searching the implemented userexits with badis for petential replacement of userexits.
Best regards Shobhan
I don't think there is a single table or anything like that. Frequently BADI information can actually be found in SPRO next to the respective configuration.
Other than that, the question "how to find BADI" has been asked here for as long as BADIs existed (10+ years for sure) and such information can be found on Google using "how to search for badi site:sap.com".
Hi, 
I agree with Jelena, there isn't a single table that lists both Business Add-Ins (BADIs) and User Exits to switch between them. However, you can search for a BADI by using transaction codes SE84 or SE15 and entering the package name. This will bring up a list of BADIs, and you can try to identify which one will solve your requirement. Once you have found the relevant BADI, you can implement it and try to debug it to see if it solves your issue.

Dear All,
I am getting the below error when i try to import CDS from the backend system. Anyone faced the similar issue and can help to resolve?

Steps already done:

-Assigned RuleSuperUser role to your user via Configure Business Rules Repository
-Cloud connector connected with backend system , destination created and system configured in SCP business rules.
Regards
Vijay

Hello Vijay,
This issue usually occurs when the user credentials you have used in the destination to connect to the backend system does not work. Can you please ensure that it is correct. Your user may be locked, or the password has changed etc.
You can open the browser developers console and check the details of the error. Btw, the check connection in the destination does not check the credentials. Ensure that the user is not locked in the backend system (check in the backend system!)
Can you switch to Response tab and see if there is any detailed error logged there!
Below is the error that i can see in the response tab
{"error":{"code":"bpm.rulesrepository.internalservererror","message":"com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.MissingNode (loaded by org.apache.catalina.loader.ParallelWebappClassLoader@0x00000001002f62d0) cannot be cast to com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ArrayNode (loaded by org.apache.catalina.loader.ParallelWebappClassLoader@0x00000001002f62d0)","details":[]}}

Hi,
I created an MDK app to scan NFC tags, this app works fine and is installed on my iPhone. I also created a Fiori app, where I have a button "Scan NFC" that should launch the native MDK app.
I tried many things, using deeplink, like: 

window.open("nfcreader app://")
window.open("nfcreader%20app://")
window.open("com.eliagroup.sap.pm.nfcreader.dev://")
etc... 

but no luck so far
Anyone who can tell me how I can do this?
regards,
Robbe
Robbe Wuyts
You need to provide the URL scheme of your MDK client to get it launched from your Fiori app.
If you have branded your client using MDK SDK or Cloud build service, you must have provided UrlScheme in MDKProject.json, so you need to provide the same UrlScheme e.g.window.open("<UrlScheme>://")
For public store client, it would like: window.open("sapmobilesvcs://")

Please help me..

. 
Hello senthil gajendran
You can implement such a validation with the MB_MIGO_BADI enhancement, method CHECK_ITEM.
Alternatively you can try do set the receiving batch field to display only or suppressed, so its value can't be changed. I'm not sure if it's going to work, but it's worth trying.

a technical question after Support Package import.
We've imported SAP_HR SAPKE608B6 and can see the list of its objects in SSDA (via "Attributes"). Also we need to know what country-specific objects, in our case for France, contained in the subcomponent SAPK-608B6INSAPHRCFR (SAP_HRCFR of SAP_HR) that was included into SAPKE608B6. Trying to get the list in SSDA is unsuccessful - it say "Package SAPK-608B6INSAPHRCFR does not exist". Is it possible to get it somehow from a subcomponent?

How to get Returning to Work On field in Canvas Report?

Hi folks,
currently i have upgraded my cloud connector to 2.14.2. Trying to setup for the first time with upgraded version of CC - Cloud to On-Premise to connect to my on-premise SAP S4HANA system. I am using correct internal host and port (telnet to host and port is successful) with correct protocol (HTTPS) and backend type (ABAP system) and Principal type as NONE. When i check the availability / connection to my on-premise SAP S4HANA system, it always come back with "Not Reachable".
Whilst i was using the "old cloud connector" (older version) before this, the on-premise S4HANA system was successfully connected through cloud connector with the same above setup.
Following check details are shown after "Not reachable"
Connection Check Details
MessageTLS peer issue, the partners identity could not be verified. The server certificate is either not valid, does not match the targeted hostname, or is not trusted by Cloud Connector. In the latter case, you need to check the trust store.Exceptionjavax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException: Certificate for <nn.nn.nn.nnn> doesn't match any of the subject alternative names: [ ] 
NOTE - 'n' above denotes numbers and 'x' denotes any alphabet

Appreciate if all can help in getting my on-premise system being reachable from cloud connector (2.14.2). Please let know if i have to do some addtional more steps to make my on-prem system accessible, reachable from cloud connector.
FYI - using BTP trial account.
thanks
Hi Markpen, 
as the message says: The server certificate of the target host is not accepted. The CA  that has issued it, needs to be in the trust store, if it is not empty. If this is the case, you need to make sure that the subject CN value or one of the Subject Alternate Names matches the host name used for reaching the target host - as SAN's seem to be empty according the error message, this might be the problem. This means you need to get a ne and valid certificate.

Is there anyway we can get around this without updating SAP. we are on SAP Business One 9.1 (9.10.171) . i have been quoted for the update but due to customisation it is quite large and we are happy with current version. thanks
So absolutely FED UP up !!!
From your various posts, you appear to be having multiple issues, so I must first ask if you have been able to access the various help features (e.g. the tutorial videos available from the 'Help' menu)?
PD is a powerful tool and can be overwhelming to those familiar with other tools.  Capabilities and operations in PD may not match those of other tools (e.g. the PD object model or diagrams - which are simply windows on top of the objects they show, not definitions of the object iteself, so multiple diagrams can be used to show the same objects).
I believe you indicated that you had used PD in the past.  As the product has not regressed, I must first ask which version you are using (I am running 16.7.5.0 - 'Help/About'), what version of Windows you are running on (is this a remote desktop?), if any components are being accessed from a shared drive, etc?
Was the product installed per the Installation Guide(available at https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_POWERDESIGNER)?
There are resources available via the tool, SAP, and this community that can help.  Unfortunately, without more complete information in posts such as this (please post a description of what is not working, with screen shots, if possible), help cannot easily be provided.  If issues persist, please consider opening support incidents.
Looking forward to further dialog.

When I run the program to transfer the Deferred tax (RFUMSV25), the system says List Contains no Data. I am getting this message even after I have cleared a vendor invoice with deferred tax code. My deferred tax code also has a target tax code (in FTXP). Can any one of you please let me know as to what is wrong and why I am unable to successfully run the program. Maybe I have to do some customization for the Deferred Tax Transfer program to work. If the customization is required please let me know what it involves.
I also faced the same problem and I resolved the issue. Which European country you are creating this country. Pl forward your mail ID I will forward the screen shots to you and also the SAP guidance.
Thank you so much for your help SAP NEW. your solution solved my problem.
Hi Please let us know what was the solution.

Why keeping the solution secret ?
I have created a CDM with an Entity with relationships to several other Entities.All are marked "Generate". 
In the LDM generated from this CDM, there are NO FOREIGN KEYS to support the relationships I have defined. 
Yet more MESS to clear up. 
WHY can't Powerdesigner get a BASIC thing like his right ??!! Completely unacceptable. 
Hi QLD 400,
this PD 16.7.5
Have no issue with the functions you are describing.
CDM is fine
LDM is fine

PDM is fine

and the generated SQL is fine a well
/*==============================================================*/

Hi,
did you define Primary attribute in parent entity? If not, you cannot expect PD to create Relationship with joins. Joins cannot be created out of nowhere. If you don`t post screenshots or more detailed procedure how to reproduce your issue, no one will be able to help you. Do you need some help or are you just letting off some steam?

Hello Experts,
I have a problem on creating a variance to compare from one period to another period.
Below is my KPI and Filters. Right now the variance is working because I'm using the Pay Date as period that I want to compare.
However, my latest requirement is to compare the variance based on End of Payroll Period instead of Pay Date. At the same time, I want to keep Pay Date filter as a main controller to filter based on Month level. 
This is the error I received when I changed the variance setting to End of Payroll Period.

My expected result is when I click on Mar 22, 2020 End of Payroll Period filter, it will get a variance to its previous period which is Mar 8, 2020.

Kindly need your expertise to help me on solving the problem that I currently face.
Thank you.
Best Regards,
Irfan Amir
Hi Ifran,

I was able to get this to work. Any chance does your filter has multiple select on it (Mar 22)? As I was setting up your scenario, I got the following message which pointed me in the right direction. 

If I don't switch to a single selection I get errors, but here's where I change it:

and boom the results are below:
screen-shot-2021-11-24-at-124658-pm.png
Hi Steve,
Thanks for your response.
Our filters are a single selection filter. We have tried the approach in the suggested answer during development. Still, it doesn’t solve the issue as it’s creating a static filter on a single date that only compares other selected dates values to that static date. 
We Currently have a PayDate Range filter at the Month level as the primary filter; next, we have a single selection Day level filter on the End of Payroll Period, which has multiple pay periods. We want to view the variances based on the End of Payroll Period. Both PayDate and End of Payroll Period are associated with the time dimension table in our data model.
 
Sincerely,
 
Al

Hi,
We configured the security parameters SESSION_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL_IN_MINUTES (20 minutes) and SESSION_TIMEOUT_REMINDER_IN_MINUTES (10 minutes) in our launchpad which works perfectly fine!
However, we received a requirement to disable the timeout for one specific custom UI5 app and this seems not possible via SAP settings.
parameter SESSION_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL_IN_MINUTES is for the entire cockpit.
We tried to keep the session alive (avoid time-out) by implementing following logic into our custom UI5 app:

Simulate/auto press of dummy button
Retrieve dummy data (current time) via OData call
trigger AJAX call to retrieve component.js file of a plugin as mentioned by Gregor Wolf in a community reply
trigger mousemove event as this should avoid session time-out (see SAP Note 3034757)

Unfortunately, none of above logic seems to keep the session alive and I’m running out of ideas....
Does anyone know how to keep the session alive?
I would suggest you point your SAP Basis Admins to:
Activating HTTP Security Session Management on the ABAP Platform
and also check the notes:
2735916 - Fiori Launchpad session timeout is not working after setting parameter rdisp/plugin_auto_logout
and related ones.

Greetings,
I'm having an issue populating Payroll ID field using UserID during a hire action.
I used the Employment Information Model as my base object and saved the rule on Comp Info portlet as onSave rule. 
I also tried the following:
Comp Info Model
Comp Info
I did not have any lucks. 
Any idea why it may be causing an issue?
Thanks.
Hi Berna
use the base object as HireActionModel and try the rule as shown in the screenshot.
Please assign the rule to "compinfo" object under trigger rules as
Base Object - "Employee Information Model" and Event Type as "onSave"

the rule picks up the next employee id which will used when we create/add new employee, the same id will be assigned to payroll id field in compensation info.
Thanks
Aja
As FYI,
I tried the above recommendation and it did not work. It will consume another employeenumber instead of using the same one allocated to the personIdExternal. Thus you end up with a payroll-id one iteration number before the personidexternal. We actually wanted them to be the same.

HI,
I write because we are experiencing problems in Business Objects 4.2 with version 110 of Chrome and Edge (the first already released, while for the second we tested with the beta).
With this version of the 2 browsers, the update of the webi reports hangs indefinitely even with reports that with the previous versions were updated in a few seconds.
From the Network section of Chrome's DevTools it seems to loop:

We have tested on various customer environments and it seems that the problem is present in all 4.2, while 4.3 seems to be unaffected.
I have not seen any notes or other communications from SAP regarding this.
Has anyone else encountered this problem?
Thanks in advance
Andrea
Hello, 
We also run into similar issue with Chrome version 110.0.5481.97 not working on SAP BO 4.2 SP07 and SP09 versions. Below Chrome new version works Version 110.0.5481.100 and We have tested SAP BO 4.2 SPO 07 and SP09 working as expected. 
Thanks,

This is currently a P1 with Google, you can go Star it or comment if you desire:
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1414463
As far as I know, the only options currently are to roll back Chrome/Edge, use Firefox, or try IE11 emulation mode in Edge which was never supported, but should probably work. At least it seemed to in my quick test.
Update:
The latest release of Chrome, version 110.0.5481.100, works and resolves the issue.
4.2 SP9 Patch 13 is still coming out to address it for people who cannot update yet.
We are still waiting on MS Edge to incorporate Chromes update with the fix.
While you wait, you can try using IE Compatibility in Edge to work around it for now.
Jason
Hello,
Just found that we have the same problem! Our version is 4.2 SP09 Patch 7
Already made contact with support, and we are waiting for the reply. Meanwhile we downgraded the Chrome to version 109 and stopped Google Update services. 
Do you have any solution already?
Alexandre
Hi, 
Latest update (8 Feb - 10PM CET) in our incident:

New version of chrome is out:

which solves the problem.
Both Chrome and Edge have now been patched which resolves the issue.


According to the PAM, the mentioned version is no longer supported since 31.12.2022, so don't expect new patches from SAP.
Maybe the latest ones released already have a correction to the error, but if not you will need to upgrade to 4.3 
Hi Manuel,
The BO 4.2 is out of Mainstream Maintenance, but is still in Priority One Support for 2 years. If the platform stops working with 2 of the 3 supported browsers, that's not a minor issue, but I'd rate it very-high.
I'm not expecting a new SP, but an official communication of some kind from SAP with at least a workaround or explicit indication that the only solution is to switch to 4.3.
We still have dozens of customers at 4.2, and we can't force everyone to bulk upgrade to 4.3 in a few days unless there is an official communication from SAP indicating that that is the only solution.

Hi,
Is it possible in ABAP - without work process parallelization - to parallelize multiple external HTTP requests?
Example (what I would expect to work):

Instantiate 10 HTTP Requests (cl_http_request)
Call "send" 10 times --> All 10 requests are processed by the external system
Call Receive on the first Request --> Synchronously blocks the processing until first request is done
Call Receive on the second Request --> Assumption, all requests are procesed identically fast, the second/third (etc..) Request should have already received the data --> no waiting

Implementing this code naivly with cl_http_client is not working. The second, third, fourth (...) receive call is taking the same time like the first call.


Example Code how sth. like that would look like in JS / TS:
const prom1 = axios.get("....");
const prom2 = axios.get("....");

const [answer1, answer2] = Promise.all([prom1, prom2]);<br>
I can not really believe nth. for this is existing in ABAP, as this seems to be a very simple requirement.. Instantiating workers (i.E. using function modules) is a massive overhead for such a simple task. I want to avoid that, as it causes a drain of worker-processes, which i need for other activities (i.E. users).
Thanks,
Timo
Answered myself here https://blogs.sap.com/2023/02/17/parallelize-cl_http_client/

Hi guys,
We are trying to extract data using CDS view from S4 to Azure Data Factory.

I already tried to compare these CDS views with the ones which are showing but can't find any significant difference.
Is there a setting or something which needs to be set?

Hi Experts,
I am facing a problem in SAC Planning. When I input percentage value, values get rounded down
i.e., If I Enter 1.45% it is rounding down to 1.00.
Please help me through this..Thanks in advance..
Regards,
Jeeva
1.45% is 0.0145, if your measure only has two decimals it will be rounded to 0.01(1.00%) . Please try to set your measure to 4 decimals. 
Please check the format and decimal of the Account member or the MEASURE against which you are storing these percentage values. You can set the format either in stories or at the model level. 
Hope this helps

1. Is it possible to add the DATA LAKE in DWC in DataBase Explorer? How do we get the SQL end point for the DWC DataLake?
2. Is it possible to define an effective auto data-tiering strategy using partitioning with the DWC DataLake?
Hello Asim,regarding your question about the SQL endpoint please see this blog post.
You could use this approach to write data to the HANA Cloud Data Lake and then delete the data with a second data flow with update mode DELETE. But this is a manual approach using selection criteria, not partitions.Best regards,Jens

I have an issue when creating stories in SAC 
Classic Design Experience - chart = numeric point, title replaced with dynamic text --> OK

Optimized Design Experience - chart = numeric point, want to replace title with dynamic text but I get a menu where the first section keeps loading (as if it cannot find the menu options).

Is there an issue (since recently) with the optimized design? Because I already created other stories where I had no issues adding dynamic text in the optimized design experience.
Kind regards,
Lieselot
I just found a workaround (temporary I hope).
If you select the title of your chart and click Shift-F10 then it is possible to add the dynamic text in the optimized design experience.

Please help.
The field Valuated stock(LBKUM) carries the total stock of the material item before the transaction.
With a document with more than one of the same material codes, the first line reflects the correct Quantity and value of the stock before the transaction is taking place.
The problem is that the next line item for the same material code reflects the change of the stock before line one, but is not updated with line 1's change of the stock.
So all line of the document for this same material reflects the the quantity of the stock before the document and not before the previous line item.
In calculating the stock just after the transaction, by using the last line of the same material, the "end stock" is not taking into account the previous line items of the same document.
Is this standard SAP procedure?
 or can the individual lines be undated with the correct previous stock before the previous line item and not before this document?

Can we create multiple user statuses for network activities and assign different profiles to different NWAs under same WBS?
Hi,
1. There are two types of user statuses, one is with a status sequence number and another is without. You can combine these two types. Normally it is only one user status with a status number and any number of statuses without a sequence number.
2. Technically possible, but not via standard customizing. You will likely need a substitution exit based on some other NWA characteristic value.  It can be done only once at the start of lifecycle, so you should not be changing the profile afterwards.
Regards,
Paulo
Yes, release action does not need to have any dependency with a user status. It can, but does not need to.

Hello,
Working on GTS(SP20) and S/4. In R/3, the SD Documents did not have Foreign Trade status fields. In S/4, there are Foreign Trade status fields. These are updated when the SD Document is replicated to GTS. 
However, when the status of the SD Document changes in GTS, I would assume that there is mechanism to send the status to S/4. Has anyone encountered this mechanism?
I know there is a program in S/4 (/sapsll/sd0a_doc_upd_reprocess), but how does SAP propose this program is used when creating a delivery from the SD document? 
I don't support S/4 but have dug around.
Please let me know your thoughts.

Hi expert, I need help to expose my application made in BAS to the Launchpad on BTP. After I add my application to "My content"

The first step I took was to clone the application and try to add it to some catalogs and groups. But is not visible on the right bar 
Plus the visualization has not write anything about the tile

For that, I changed my manifest and add the crossNavigation information (I don't know if it's the right solution). Deploy, but either there are no updates in the "Launchpad service", and my application has the same problem. 
If I tried to download it from the HTM5 repository, the manifest changes are there. Maybe I need to correct something in the mta file ? I hope I express my problem correctly, regards, Sebastiano

Have you tried refreshing the HTML5 Apps content provider? 

Hi, Sebastiano.For the application to be recognized by the standard Content Provider (id: saas_approuter) in the Launchpad Service, there are a few things that need to be done:
If you haven't set them up correctly, chances are your app won't be found by the Launchpad service.
Hope it helps.

Hi experts,
In a trial environment, we are using SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery to deploy our CAP applications.
We have configured the SonarQube Scan stage and the scan is running as expected, but a failed result in SonarQube is being considered as success by the job:

The result in SonarQube:

I would expect that failed scan runs stop my CI/CD job execution.
I did some research and I guess that you get the result from the task instead of getting it from the analysis. Details below.
In the execution logs we get a set of urls and the final result: SUCCESS.

The url you provide with belongs to the task summary, in that case the url is https://xxxxxxxxxxxx.com/api/ce/task?id=AYZWEGSC8rBChjMtw6Rt and the content is the following, with status SUCCESS (wich means that the task has been executed succesfully).

But this is not the result of the scan, that is provided by the analysis (analysysId property in the previous json) by the url https://xxxxxxxxxxxx.com/api/qualitygates/project_status?analysisId=AYZWEGr5vNmC9pE5H0K-, with status ERROR:

Could you please check it or tell me if, on the contrary, the problem can come from the configuration of my SonarQube?
Best regards,
Marc
Hi Marc,
you need to create the file sonar-project.properties in the root of your project and add the line

Hello Experts,
I can't delete alias tables on IDT .
The table alias does not point to any table, the original table has been deleted.
Have you ever encountered this kind of problem?.
Thank you .

2. The connected DB user no longer has access to the table.

I creating a simple northwind product master-detail app, and I created a page parameter for the detail page for the product. But the page parameter cannot be a number, yet the product ID is an integer.
Yes, I can use a formula to transform it, but I had to do it in several places and it felt not as nice.
Why can't page parameter be a number? Is there a cleaner way of doing this? 

Currently the page parameter can only be a text, so you'll need to transform it via formula. I don't know if there is a technical reason why a page parameter can't be anything but a text, but at the moment text is the only thing it can be.
Hi all,
S/4 HANA On Premise - Fiori - Enterprise Contract Management
I'm able to upload a document for a Legal Transaction (e.g. pdf or word).
I'm able to see, to open, this document in CV03N in SAP GUI.
But, when I try to open it from Fiori, from the same Legal Transaction, I'm getting the error message "An error occurred while retrieving tokens and URL". 
In SLG1 I see also the error "CX_ODATA_CV_ATTACH_EXCEPTION has occurred".
So, the document is saved, but not accessible via Fiori.
Do you know which settings I'm missing here?
I suppose it's about CA-DMS
Thank you.

Hi all,
is it possible to set a timestamp for the data import in SAC? So to have in addition to the timestamp of the objects (created at, updated at) the timestamp of the data import. That would be benefical, because the admin or user of SAC then can know on the first glance how up-to-date the data is (when the last import was). 
Any tips how to implement? 
Thanks and regards
Deborah
Result from the request on influence portal:
Delivered in Q2/2021
Comment (limited to 500 chars):
This is actually doable in the new model. You'd want to create a "imported at" dimension. Then in the wrangling for the load job, do the following. Create a new column, using the WEL expression "[ImportTime] = Now()" and map this column this to your imported time dimension.
Hi Deborah,
Great question! Unfortunately, there is no property of the model that captures the data import timestamp which could be used as a dynamic text. The only solution I see is that you add a dimension into your model which is updated before you import data into the model.
Perhaps you can submit a request on the customer influence portal to add this feature to SAC: https://influence.sap.com
Kind regards,
Martijn van Foeken | Interdobs
Hi Deborah Acker,
I am indeed referring to such a solution because also adding a calculated column to a model when importing data from a file doesn't provide the option to add such a field. So it needs to be defined and updated in the source I'm afraid.
Great that you submitted an Influence Request! You got my vote!

Is it possible to set up business partner relationship e.g. for credit check to happen only at parent level by customer hierarchy settings in VDH1N?------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
The customer hierarchy and business partner parent-child relationship are two completely different functionalities and one can not substitute the other.For credit check and credit exposure update settings, always the FSCM parent-child relationship maintenance should be considered and customer hierarchy can not be used for this purpose.You need to maintain the 'Relationships' between business partners to achieve the this functionality in transaction UKM_BP.In UKM_BP you have two possible 'Relationship categories' specially referring to the Credit Management:FUKM001 - Higher-level Credit Management Account of... (e.g. holding company/parent company - head office)TUKM001 - Lower-level Credit Management Account for... (e.g. subsidiary/affiliate/associated company - branch)
To make the assignment on the Higher-level business partner, you edit the business partner in UKM_BP and under the 'Relationships' tab you add the 'Relationship category' FUKM001. Then you can add the Lower-level business partners into the field 'Relationship to BP'. After saving the settings you can open the Lower-level business partner in UKM_BP and under 'Relationships' a new tab will appear, which shows that this business partner is a 'Lower-level Credit Management Account for' the BP listed on the screen. On the tab of the credit management relevant relationship you can check the assignment of the business partners by changing the 'Format' of the display to 'Hierarchy'.You also need to maintain credit checks only at parent level if you wish FSCM to consider its credit limit and not the child BP's credit limit.For further details about setting up parent-child relationships in FSCM, please review SAP Note 2706299.

Dear Experts,
I Have one query regarding posting value from one month to another in data action in SAC.
Let me consider I have one value in month June. I want to post value from June to August. Can anyone help how its done in SAC. I am attaching image for your reference.Thanks in Advance
Regards,
Jeeva9309

Data ( Time = 'Target Month' ) = Result Look Up ( Time = 'Source Month' )Add other dimensions as well accordingly.
Jeevan Kumar
I can see from your example that you want to copy a set of values from one month to another. You have to provide some details in order to help you better.
Will you always copy from June to August for all years or specific year.
I can see you are not copying within same line item row. So the dimension in your rows in example above, you are copying from one member to another.
Is this a one time copy or you need something for recurrence.
Based on above you will have a choice of wither copy data Action or Advanced formula data action.

Hi Folks,
I got a quick question in regards to disaggregation.
We plan TOP-3 products detailed out. Rest of products is aggregated to # for planning purposes.Requirement is at the end of planning to disaggregated back to actual detail level (all products) based on the "orignal" proportions of the "other products" to do some further calculations on product level in a SIM version.

Manually this is easily achieved by copying Actual to SIM version and then by filtering Qty to all but A,B,C -> then input the # Qty from the final plan and the system will disaggregate to the "orginal" products.But can I achieve this in a data action or allocation process in an automated way?Allocation usually uses typically another measure driver (as far as I have seen the examples) so not sure if this is working if the driver is the same qty and the to be distribute dimension is also the same.
Many thanks for all replies in advance!Best regardsAxel
PS: Above example is simplified - real planning model is a bit more complicated and there are also more Top and Button products. Further more automation is error free process / manual copy would not ...
 Axel Radack 
After copying Actual for Detail products and final plan of # into a different version. You can use allocation to disaggregate. The measure to be distributed and driver can be same. You can combine both copying and allocation in a multi action to combineHave shown an example belowhttps://answers.sap.com/questions/13818121/allocation-2.html?source=email-global-notification-qa-new-in-tag-followed
Another approach can be to use a variable member of product to aggregate Actual value of detail products and then use this as denominator of ratio and multiply with plan value of each detail productsHope this helps

How to convert dimension attribute to measure using data actions in sap analytic cloud? I have to do calculations based on Base quantity attribute of Material dimension and another measure called BOM Quantity. I'm trying to store Base quantity attribute value to a new measure for calculation. 
Have tried below code but its giving errors
DATA([d/Measures]="BSQTY")= RESULTLOOKUP([d/Material].[p/BS_QTY])
DATA([d/Measures]="MQTY", [d/SP_DATASOURCE]="Manual") = 
RESULTLOOKUP([d/Measures]="BOMQTY")/RESULTLOOKUP([d/Measures]="BSQTY")
Assuming base quantity attribute of material is of type of integer below code should work for storing it in another  measure or reading it for calculation

Hi everyone, i have a little question. How much does the cloud connector cost for cloud to on-premise use? Thank you
Hi Emilio, 
it depends how you look on it: 
To summarize: currently, there is no separate license only for Cloud Connector, it is always included in larger bundles. This refers to the case, in which you as a customer manage everything on your own. 
RISE is more and in case of questions about pricing for Cloud Connector in that context you should approach your account manager. (As you have written yourself - here we talk about SAP managed setups including additional services and not only the software piece)
Best regards,Markus
It's free!
(Even if you only have an SAP BTP trial account, you can download it for free. But I think, trial accounts are limited to a certain time period, so once you want to start using it productively, you will need a regular subscription. But Cloud Connector (SCC) is still free of charge.)
Hi Emilio,
The cloud connector required an specific hardware to be able to run properly and as far as I know there is no any license to use the software and you can install on premises unless you are asking SAP to have cloud Connector in SAP cloud (Hyperscaler on RISE) and for that one you need to reach out to SAP sale team.
Please for more detail check below links:
Cloud connector Prerequisites
Cloud Connector, explained in simple terms
Thanks,
Hi Emilio,
Since you mentioned your Cloud Connector going to provision in Hyperscaler or SAP Managed Cloud then the way this works is the TechOps will start to provision the Cloud Connector for you in your SAP Cloud landscape as soon as you as customer signed the CR.
You can contact your CDM (Client Delivery Manger) to request for that.
Cloud Connector software is free but I imagine you already have prod and non-prod systems in your SAP Could Landscape and this solution going to be used for both.
You need at least three VMs to support your cloud connector solution .
Number 1 :Non prod Cloud Connector
Number 2 :Prod Cloud Connector
Number 3 :DR Cloud Connector
Every VM will cost customer and the cost depends on which public cloud provider you are in and which rejoin ...
In order to get all these details related to your cost you can ask from the SAP Architect who was assigned to your account, the person he/she helped to provision the systems in the start .He should be able to brake down the number and cross check to see the figure you received is correct.
Hope this helps!

For exposing BAPI as a SOAP service we are trying to send XML data from SAP CPI to S4 system using SOAP adapter and the extracted SOAP WSDL. We are receiving the below error.
"org.apache.cxf.ws.policy.PolicyException: Assertion of type {http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-securitypolicy/200702}HttpsToken could not be asserted: Not an HTTPs connection"
The Configuration done is as below:

Some Options tried:
1) Removed <Policy> tags and the included <HttpsToken> tags - Received Connection Refused Error
2) After Removing enite WSDL - Unable to save and deploy as validation failed.
Can someone please provide me resolution for this?
UPDATE: 
We have generated another WSDL with No policies option selected. PFB Snap for ref

Using this generated wsdl and SOAP service url now we are getting below error.

Also, The SAP CPI tenant host i/p keeps dynamically changing.
Can someone please help to provide resolution for this.

Issue is not in CPI. You need to change/remove the SOAP authentication mechanism in SOAMANAGER on backend system. You should select either basic authentication or Certificate based authentication only.
Hello all,
While doing stock transfer with movement type 999, the quantity to transfer is getting automatically changed.Ex. Material master --> WM2 View has quantity of 160 for storage unit type E2.
Now when I try to do a stock transfer of 1600 from A to B bin, then the quantity is automatically changed to 160.My understanding is that the quantity should be a multiple of 1600. Please correct me if I am wrong.
Thanks.
AH
Hi Ammu,
if you have settings in WM2-view like you describe your total amount should be split in portions of 160 - that is: 10 portions in your example.
As you have not supplied any information on the settings of the destination storage type it is fairly hard to say what happened.
My guess is that you either have 10 transfer orders with one item or you have 1 transfer order with 10 items, the items having 160 each. And you are looking at one TO or one item only.
Best regards
Andreas

Hello everyone,
I need to find the average monthly revenue for each client. I could make a sum by Year and have it divided by 12 to obtain the Monthly Revenue. Yet, I'm using Data filters for other widgets so this is not an option.
If i filter 3 months, I need the sum of what he bought divided by how many months I have selected (filtered).
How do i make this count of months to be dynamic?
Sum of revenue by selected data / count of months
Vitor Weisheimer
The below solution is based on Account Model but should also work for Measure based Model.
I created 4 Calculated Measures in story calculation shown below to get the result and it works on Filters applied. My example is based on measure Quantity
1. Month Count: Just to get the count of months

2. Total Month Count: To get the total months based on filter applied. If 3 month selected it should be 3.

3. Total Quantity: To get the aggregated total of the measure for selected months

4. Average Quantity

Output: 3 month selected

5 month selected:

The helping measures can be hidden from report if required.

Hello,
I am a begginer in Personas scripting so please forgive this basic question.
I am calling the following RFC and it works fine, as long as there is a valid use in the ERP system:
var oRFC = session.createRFC("HR_GETEMPLOYEEDATA_FROMUSER");
oRFC.setParameter("USERNAME", user);
oRFC.setParameter("VALIDBEGIN", today);
oRFC.requestResults(["EMPLOYMENTSTATUS", "NAMEOFORGUNIT", "NAMEOFPOSITION"]);
oRFC.send();
var _EMPLOYMENTSTATUS = oRFC.getResult("EMPLOYMENTSTATUS");
var _NAMEOFORGUNIT = oRFC.getResult("NAMEOFORGUNIT");
var _NAMEOFPOSITION = oRFC.getResult("NAMEOFPOSITION");

if (_EMPLOYMENTSTATUS) {
  session.findById("wnd[0]/usr/txtPersonas_16758785287954").text = "";
  session.findById("wnd[0]/usr/txtPersonas_167603969450461").text = "";
  session.findById("wnd[0]/usr/txtPersonas_167603990376019").text = "";
  session.findById("wnd[0]/usr/txtPersonas_16758785287954").text = _NAMEOFPOSITION;
  session.findById("wnd[0]/usr/txtPersonas_167603969450461").text = _NAMEOFORGUNIT;

  if (_EMPLOYMENTSTATUS == "3") {
    session.findById("wnd[0]/usr/txtPersonas_167603990376019").text = "ACTIVE";
  } else {
    session.findById("wnd[0]/usr/txtPersonas_167603990376019").text = "NOT ACTIVE";
  }
} 
However sometimes a user won't exist (they either no longer work for the company or they don't have a record valid for today's date) and so no values are returned by the RFC. This results in the following error popup box appearing on the Personas screen:

And the script logging shows this:

Would anyone know how to avoid the error popup box from appearing please?
Thanks in advance.
So far been lucky enough to use RFCs with a RETURN parameter, maybe it is worth checking out the other methods for oRFC?

try... catch.. seems to work for me. Just a rudimentary test though.

I am working in following environment. I had decided to take up QM certification but unfortunately SAP QM ERP 6.0 EHP5 certification C_TPLM40_65 expired few months before. Now only SAP QM HANA certification C_TS414_2021 is available. Will I be able to clear SAP QM HANA certification with ERP 6.0 EHP5 concepts alone? Are there major differences between ERP 6.0 EHP5 QM and HANA QM? Kindly guide.


Hi,
There are significant differences between SAP QM ERP 6.0 EHP5 and SAP QM HANA. The HANA version has been optimized for the SAP HANA database and utilizes newer technologies like SAP Fiori for the user interface. Additionally, the HANA version includes new and updated functionalities, such as predictive quality, which are not available in the ERP 6.0 EHP5 version.
That being said, if you have a strong understanding of QM concepts in ERP 6.0 EHP5, it will definitely help you in preparing for the SAP QM HANA certification. However, you will need to study the new and updated functionalities in SAP QM HANA to be fully prepared for the certification exam. It is also recommended that you familiarize yourself with the SAP HANA database, as it is a key component of the HANA version.

Dear ABAP2XLS users,
I use ABAP2XLS to create an Excel-File from ALV list.
There are two steps pending:
1. Assign the WRAPTEXT style to all cells.
2. Calculate optimal width for all comluns.
As I do not know how Excel-Files work internally I can not figure out a good aproach. All examples I saw are related to only one cell (assign style) or one column.
Are there any ideas or exmples which are helpfull?
Thanks in advance
Thomas
For wrapping the text, there is the demo program ZDEMO_EXCEL14 (abap2xlsx Demo: Alignment).
abap2xlsx may calculate approximately the width of a column based on the texts contained in it. For this to work, you must install the True Type fonts in SE73. There is the demo program ZDEMO_EXCEL31 (abap2xlsx Demo: Autosize Column with different Font sizes). If the fonts are not installed in SE73, the logic will be based on the number of characters, considering all have the same width, and on the font size.
I don't see what issue you have to apply to all cells and all columns.
You can pull all the demo programs in your system, from the repository Demos.
For ALV, you also have CL_SALV_TABLE=>TO_XML which creates an XLSX file.
EDIT: to apply a style on all cells, you can either set a default style (SET_DEFAULT_STYLE in ZCL_EXCEL), or use the method CHANGE_AREA_STYLE to change parts of styles of a range of cells (ZDEMO_EXCEL40).
Hi Sandra,
Thanks for your reply.
I already know the program ZDEMO_EXCEL14. As I already mentioned in the whole program the method LO_WORKSHEET->SET_CELL is used to apply a style to a single cell. Of course I can iterate over all cells and use the SET_CELL_STYLE method to apply a WRAPTEXT style. But I hope that there is a better method to apply the style to all cells of a worksheet.
Kind Regards,
Thomas

I found the doc explaining how to consume it using the OnLinkDataReceived event (https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/features/fiori-ui/mdk/deep-link.html)
My question is: How to I "enable/register" this mdkclient scheme using the SAP MDK SDK?
i.e. How do I "Create an Intent Filter in the Manifest" using SAP MDK as explained below
https://help.sap.com/doc/f53c64b93e5140918d676b927a3cd65b/Cloud/en-US/docs-en/guides/features/application-links/android/deeplink.html
Thanks
The second link is not specific to MDK.  The url scheme used for receiving deep links in MDK is the URLScheme defined in the MDKProject.json used to create your client.  If you are running the App/Play store client then they are using sapmobilesvcs as the URL scheme.  The MDK client handles the registration for the scheme automatically.  You simply need to specify the OnLinkDataReceived action to get triggered when the link is sent and act accordingly.
Thanks Bill, somehow I can't make it work...
Here is what I have done:
- updated my MDKProject.json with "UrlScheme": "myTestApp"
- deployed new version with updated code:
Application.app update: 
- OnLinkDataReceivedHandler.js code:
- rebuilt my app using Mobile Cloub Build feature (Customized Mobile Development Kit Client and updated with my new zipped .mdkProject folder)
- installed the built .apk on my phone
Now when i generate a QRCode with content: myTestApp://?ProductId=123 then read it (using google lens for instance) I expect this link to open my newly installed app
I may be missing something obvious though (never worked with deep link and mobile app before)
Thanks
I ran a test using the following rule (which is essentially the same a yours) 
on an emulator and sent the deep link via adb using the following command
The client launches (if not running) and the OnLinkDataReceived event is fired resulting in the following output.

Hello Guys
I got stuck in one issue. While converting data from XML to JSON, backslash is inserted ahead of forwards slash. My field is not a Date/Time field. 
Pls guide.
Sample Payload
{ "JSONASNHEADER": [ { "STRBACODE": "V0041161", "STRPONUMBER": " ORB\/PO\/2019-2020\/62", actual data was ORB/PO/2019-2020/62] "INTCURRENCYCODE": 72, "STRBAREFASNNUMBER": "TX1901044189", "DTBAREFDTASNDATE": "05-JAN-2020", "STRINVOICENUMBER": "TX1901044189", "DTINVOICEDATE": "05-JAN-2020", "DECINVOICEVALUE": "937008.00" } ] }
Hi Tarun, 
This is a known issue in JSON conversion as SAP uses Jettison Library. Escaping of forward slash is default behaviour of REST adapter. 
Option 1 : The only way to bypass this issue is to use XML to JSON conversion using JAVA mapping. Please find below the Java code to perform XML to JSON conversion.
The below codes requires some extra libraries to be downloaded.
If a customer is using the CHARM Solution Manager scenario and they go to Private Cloud Edition. It is possible to use this scenario in Cloud ALM? or must the customer has their own Solution Manager in Cloud to do it?
Thnaks in advance
Carmen
Hi Carmen,
At this time ChaRM capability is not available in SAP Cloud ALM. As per SAP Cloud ALM Roadmap Explorer, "Deployment of ABAP-based transports" is on the roadmap for Q3/2021. However, please understand roadmap are forward-looking statements and may change. You should also keep an eye on Supported Solutions of SAP Cloud ALM: You can filter by SAP Solution, but also by SAP Cloud ALM Capability of Change & Deployment Management to see if capability is available for specific SAP Solution.
Since ChaRM is not available on SAP Cloud ALM today, customer needs to evaluate their need and could use SAP Solution Manager (regardless of the SolMan deployment being on-prem or hosted) for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition
Thanks,
Rahim Kassam.
Thanks a lot for you answer.
is there any document with the functionalities differencies between cloud ALM and Solution Manager?
Thanks again

Hi all. can anyone explain the below scenario?
I am picking a pallet from the storage type. Whenever the order quantity is equal to the pallet quantity it directly goes to the GI area, whenever the order quantity is less than the pallet quantity it needs to go to the work center, and there I need to break the pallet and move the required quantity to GI area.
 To achieve this above process what configuration I need to do.
Hi,
for this you use a pick point. 
https://help.sap.com/viewer/3d97bec9bf1649099384bb8167df3cf2/9.5.0.2/en-US/52c8cb53ad377114e10000000a174cb4.html
And with LOSC you control that full pallets are not moving via the pick point.

Hello Juergen , 
I am also working on same business requirement. 
But in my case LOSC that controls that full pallets to not move via pick point is not working. 
For both Full pallet and Partial pallet a pick product wt is created to move HU from source storage type to Packing bin.
While confirming the pick task in RF the LOSC gets triggered in both the scenarios and destination bin is dynamically changed to Intermediate work centre bin . 
I have maintained the configuration as suggested in another thread https://answers.sap.com/questions/13088296/losc-with-partial-picking-1.html.
May you please guide what i would be missing.
Thanks Daniil for your response . I have set up the customizing as you have mentioned. losc.pngsource-storage-type-setting.png

Hello All, 
I have an HA installation with ASCS running across two nodes supported by pacemaker. 
Since unlike the case of standalone gateway, the integrated gateway (with ASCS) guarantees the HA of gateway too.
So to connect external RFC clients, i opted for integrated gateway along with ASCS services. 
- Do i need to do any additional configuration to allow clients reach ABAP instance via integrated gateway i.e. the way we do in case of standalone gateway as suggested in note 1010990?
- How can we fix the issue "Gateway not connected to local R/3" i.e. Note 1922046 when an external program is registered to the integrated gateway?

Hello Sumit,
The RFC Gateway integrated to the ASCS cannot be used for connections coming from client systems that want to call ABAP level functions.
This Gateway can be used only for systems that register a program.
To achieve a kind of HA for clients that want to call ABAP functions, what you can do is to configure such client systems to connect using load balance. 
You can create a group in the transaction SMLG and activate the "Ext. RFC-enabled" flag under the "attributes" tab. Then, use this group in the configuration of the client systems.
If one ABAP instance is down, it is not included in the load balance. It is used again, automatically, once it is back online.
Regards,
Isaías
Hello Sumit,
In High Availability scenario, most of the times the RFC Gateway of the ASCS is used to aggregate connections from registered server programs (Externals programs that need a RFC Gateway to register to)This is done instead of registering those External programs against an RFC Gateway that is part of a ABAP Dialog instance, since the RFC Gateway in the ASCS will be always available as part of the HA solution.KBA 1922046 - "Gateway not connected to local R/3" error, refers to a "client system is calling a RFC-enabled ABAP function to an RFC Gateway", this is different scenario.Kind regards,Mercedes
Hello Sumit,by installing the RFC Gateway in the ASCS instance you have HA for this service together with the other services of the ASCS (message server, enqueue server)What I meant is that this scenario is mainly for registered programs.If you have a RFC client where the server is one of the ABAP instances, the ASCS RFC Gateway doesn't play any role there.Kind regards,Mercedes
Hello all,
It is my first time implementing Collections Management, and after read a lot of documentation, I'm having a hard time figuring out what is the best practice to proceed with this problem.
Basically I have 4 company codes configured in the system. A Business Partner could be a client for only one or a combination of them, and I have 1300 BP.
Is it a good practice to create only one Profile, that has assigned all 4 segments (each segment represents one company code)? 
For example if a BP is a costumer for Company Code 1,Company Code 2 and Company Code 4, when assigning the Profile to the BP, I will then assign a Group for each segment, but as I created only one profile, the other Segments (representing other Company Codes that this BP is not a costumer), will also exist in the BP Collections Master Data Tab.
Does this represent any kind of problem?

For example in this example above, Profile GC, imagine that this BP is only a costumer for AGR and BL segments (each segment is associated with only 1 Company Code), does this create a problem?
I cannot understand why the AGR line is blue. If this BP have a debt for company code BL, will it appear on the worklist for BL Group?
Thank you

When i m doing PGI i m getting dump error.what is the reason for it?
By the time i usually re-install my SAP.Is there any possibility to solve it without re-installing.
Hi

Just reiterating what the other users have said. Check the ST22 log and see where is the rootcause of the dump. If it is a custom code implemented by you take the help of your ABAP developer and fix the issue.

If dump log points to a standard code then check using the standard program name in SCN or Service.sap.com to see what is the cause of the dump
Hi,

can you put the screenshot of dump to check?

regards,
santosh
Hi,
There are many Reasons for getting the Dump
Tables are not properly copied
Number ranges are Exhausted
programme may not met the Conditions
As suggested please provide the Screen shot.
For these of issue(Dump error).
FYI, you can analysis your dump error in TCode ST22.

Where you can check following::

Based on above information work with ABAP team to resolve the issue or understand the root cause of the issue. The possible cause of the error can be due to new enhancement, wrong process flow... so on and so forth. 

Thanks, JP
Hi Srikalaivani ,

I faced a similar kind of issue While posting goods issue from outbound delivery in PGI, for that i referred to SAP note 825448 Error message - no RFC destination when posting mat.

Moreover ,if can u provide "Name of runtime error" ? if you copy n paste short dump analysis from Tcode:ST22 - as suggested above.We can analyse and propose you the right solution.

Hello Experts,
we are using WB2R_DOC_ENTRY to enter invoices from the customer.to a contract.
I would like to reduce the already made accruals for this contract by the document value from WB2R_DOC_ENTRY.
Any hints how to get that done?
I put the accruals reversal conditions into pricing but with no effect.
Kind Regard
Martina 
Hi Martina, 
We use WB2R_DOC_ENTRY for creating Manual settlements against a condition contract. 
When we settle condition contact manually, system will also deduct accruals. Accruals deduction calculation can be seen in condition usage at WCOCO screen. 


Let me know if you need further information. 
Thank you
Satwik Joshi
Thanks a lot for your answer Satwik.
Yes I know that the accruals are reversed with the settlement, but I want to do that in the transaction WB2R_DOC_ENTRY already, because I don't want to make a settlement (out of process reasons).
Would be great if someone knows a solution.
Thanks
MArtina 
Hi Martina, 
Can you please help me to understand, what is business need? 
Thank you
Satwik Joshi
Hi Satwik,
we are getting numerous invoices and credit notes from customer and we cannot settle after every document we get. But accruals shall be reversed immediately on receipt of the invoice.
Kind Regards

Hi Martina, 
You can use WZR1 transaction to create accruals reversals. 
Choose “0S60” is Settl. Process Type. 



This transaction will help in accruals reversal process.

Dear experts,
One of the employee is becoming part time employee from his full time contract. FTE has been adjusted in the workflow but salary components are not calculating but the value remains the same as the Full time salary in stead of adjusting as per the part time.
Please share your thoughts.
Thank you,
Does the FTE have an on change rule for this and did you tick the compensation box (so that changes to compensation are also applied based on the FTE)? If not, that would perhaps explain why it doesn't automatically show in your screen.

Hello,
We are in public cloud and want to change the standard component structure Y1. 
We did not find an option to create a new component structure and therefore depend only on the existing one by SAP.
It is possible to add accounts and change descriptions of elements. But we cannot delete and reassign accounts that were configured by SAP.
Is there an explanation for this behaviour or has anyone raised an incident by SAP as this is a fault?
I appreciate your comments.
Kind Regards, Wolf
Hi Enda,
Good day, 
Please make sure that the corresponding cost component structure is not active while editing and re-activate it if changes are done. hope it‘s helpful. 
B,R
Gary 
Hi Wolf,
The standard design of the SSCUI does not provide the option to create a new cost component structure or delete the entries provided by SAP  and also the ‘From Cost element'. As an alternative you can use the below workaround:
As long as you don’t post this GL, GL assigned to cost component should not create any negative impact. You can block the GL account for which you do not want to make postings/use to avoid any accidental posting.
Best Regards,Ujvala
Hi Ujvala,
Thanks for the reply.
Is there a specific reason that a new component structure is not allowed?
We now must adjust all acounts according to this structure. But our customer has already set up new accounts as well.

Hi guys,
 We are still using SAP CC 3.0 in our landscape. We want to know which version of oracle database are supported by this version, can somebody help us?
Thanks in advance
Hi Yanick,
CC 3.0 has been out of maintenance for four of five years now, so we no longer publish any official information about it.Still, CC 3.0's latest support package's SAP note announces that support for Oracle 12c was validated in March 2017 (the highest authorized version before that was Oracle 11.2, it seems).You can see the announcement about 12c in SAP note 2431853 ("SAP CC 3.0 Support Package 17"):https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2431853
If it helps, the old SAP notes are still available in the SAP knowledge base, but we'd still like to stress the fact that CC 3.0 is definitively and completely out of maintenance (and, more importantly, out of support), so we strongly advise you to upgrade your system (for example, CC 2022 has been out for a couple weeks now, and the data model and the API both guarantee ascending compatibility).
Best regards.

When attempting to install the "SAP Crystal Reports for Visual Studio (SP33) installation package for Microsoft Visual Studio IDE (VS 2022 and above)" by executing file CRforVS6413SP33_0-80007712.EXE you get the following error:
** You must already have Microsoft visual C++ 2013 redistributable (x64) installed to proceed with this installation. **
I just installed Microsoft visual C++ 2013 redistributable (x64) but I now get:
"Windows cannot find 'setup.exe'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again."
Can you please help me? I have deleted a whole bunch of temporary files that I thought may help but it did not.
Thanks in advance,

I did run the executable as an Administrator. The .exe file creates a temporary directory under AppData\Temp\RarSFX0. The created directory was never recreated after my initial installation failed. Then, I kept on receiving the "Windows cannot find setup.exe" message. To fix this issue, I used a different computer and I installed the "C++ 2013 redistributable (x64)" before I installed the "CRforVS6413SP33_0-80007712.EXE" but I was careful to copy the AppData\Temp\RarSFX0 directory before proceeding with the language selection of the installation. I copied the whole directory to the original computer and ran the installation from within the copied directory. 
I hope that my reply benefits someone who is experiencing the same issue as I did. The easy fix from SAP's side would be to require the C++ 2013 redistributable (x64) before attempting to install the CRforVS6413SP33_0-80007712.EXE
Thanks for taking my question Dell

Make sure that you right-click on the .exe and select "Run as Administrator".  If that doesn't resolve the issue, you might re-download the .exe and try again.

Hi Ramon,
That is very odd, I've never seen that happen before. 
I suspect there is some issue on your PC that is causing the error to be generated...
You could have deleted the original folder when it failed, sometimes rebooting will fix it also.

Hi ,
there is report Profit Overview by Key Figure report (Cost and Revenue workcenter / list of reports) can be made so that the the report will show all companies in all countries as a group level report. there is set of books is mandatory field how can i skip that 
Hello Zainabmy former colleague wrote a Blog post about analytical profilesAnalytical profiles for Monitoring Business Units in SAP Business ByDesign Cloud ERP | SAP Blogs
In a nutshell:You define in a profile parameter combinations. These are report independent.In the selection variants of the report you can use these parameters by means of relative selctes 'from profile'.By this you can easily switch a dashboard for example with 3-4 embedded reports by switching the profile once.
Be aware that this capability of analytical profile needs to be explicitly switched on
Best regardsStefan
Hello Zainab.a cross company, a cross set of books selection is for good reasons not enabled.a) You would start adding non related datab) Based on the company / set of books combination a validation of the contribution margin scheme is done. This scheme is a must input since the restricted keyfigures relay on symantically flagged elements of the contribution margin scheme.
Best RegardsStefan
Hello Zainab,
the report 'Profit Overview by Key Figure' allows to select multiple companies.But the all have to have the same set of books. Otherwise you would be adding 'apple and pears'. 
If you have multiple companies not sharing the same set of books you need to invoke the report multiple times with different selection variants. to facilitate that you could consider:a) building a dashboard using the same report with different selection variantsb) build with the excel plugin a workbook embedding the same reports with multiple selection variants.c) you could consider recommending using profiles

Hi,
Does anyone has experience in automating KSU2: Change Actual Assessment Cycle, particularly on updating the Receiver Tracing Factor for each Segment?
Thanks for the help!
Kind regards,
Alejandro
Hi Alejandro,
It would not be a good system practice to update those on the fly as it will limit your auditing capabilities.
A better approach would be to post it as SKF monthly, so you would always have a document behind, full historical transparency and much easier automation.  Maybe via a script recording from the Excel file.

I am trying to access the SAP BTP Cockpit trial version, but I have an error message: 
Could not load global account: Internal Server Error (500)

I tried to access again and requested a 365-day extension, but again it continued with the same error: Could not load global account: Internal Server Error (500) 
The last time I tried to log in, it told me that it couldn't find any global account associated with my user: 
Logged in as XXX 
We couldn't find any global accounts associated with your user. 
If you believe this is mistake, contact your cloud operator. 

It is strange because a few months ago everything was working correctly. The strange thing is that I can still access my workspace in SAP BAS without problems.

Hi Walter Poclava,
Have you found a solution to this issue already?

Hello,I just ran into this error today. Has anyone figured out a solution?
HI,
I believe SAP note https://me.sap.com/notes/0003090520 could help here?

Can a Super User convert multiple S Users to Universal ID's? if so is there any documentation. 
Or the Universal Id's are created individually by users. 
Thanks...Raj

Hey,
each SAP Universal Identity (ID) represents a single unique human individuum. To associate S-Users accounts to UIDs assign the S-Users to emails each user owns. Afterwards the users can link the S-Users to their Universal ID. If they don't have an Universal ID yet it's pretty easy and quick to create one. And the users are asked to create an UID if they don't have one in the email informing them about the S-User creation.Super Users / Partner Admins can check the UID linking status of a S-User via the SAP UMT application.For more details check out the Universal ID info page. Cheers,Sebastian
Thank you Sebastian.

Hello,
my requirement is to Change IW32 to display mode based on Plant Maintenance Order specific user status..
for this i have written an implicit enhancement code in include : LCOIHF7R.
by using this implicit enhancement code all the other tabs are going into display mode except Enhancement Tab.


may i know where i am going wrong..
please guide me in this regard.
thanks you all..
U can check this blog.
IW32 to Display mode | SAP Blogs
You have to correct/enhance the PBO of your customer dynpro to handle this case too.
Question: How will you change this user status once set (only with BAPI?)
Hi experts, 
I am having trouble with screen sizing in SAP Business One version 10, along with some other users in my company as well
The sections of the lines and header / footer of the sales order are cropped:

Please refer to the Delivery where all screen settings are in the correct place 

And below I've added a screenshot of de Sales Order screen of another user where the buttons Add/Update and Cancel fall off the screen (and there is no scroll bar to find the buttons). Also her screen is cropped like mine (less bad but still not OK)

I have tried changing font sizes, (un)plugigng from my docking station / extra screens, looked at my laptop screen settings etc. but did not find anything unusual. I have inactivated all Item Placement Tool functionality and restarted SAP but that did not help too. There are no UI Configuration Templates active.
Does anyone have an idea how to deal with this? 
Thanks, 
Irene
Hi Irene,
please try:
before clicking on sales order in the menu, press the shift key on the keyboard. Then click. Hold the key until the window is complete open.
Pressing the key forces SAP to renew the cache of the window.
regards Lothar
I found the problem. It was caused by Form Width / Form Height setting in the Function Buttons set-up.
Hi community,
I need to create an adaptation project of a standard application to add custom buttons. The adaptation project works fine but my problem is that this application was previously adapted using adapt UI and extended CDS. 
Is there any way to "migrate" the UI adaptation to the adaptation project to avoid re-build all the UI adaptation?
I think the adaptation project is considered a totally different application and because of this the UI adaptation is not displayed.
Thanks in advance.
I would like to search, sort or use some kind of filter in a structure list. In this case IW38, Change PM orders: structure list. Today its only sorted by equipment no. I would like to search, or sort the list by Room. Is it possible?
Can anyone help me with the Decision tree for all the RICEFW objects taking into account what BTP, In-App, Classcial ) to go with and when. Thanks in advance!! 

Hello SAP Fiori Elements Community,
with the help of Marian Zeis my question Side effect after executing a bound action: How to trigger sorting of result list? was solved. But now I face a similar issue an unbound action. In my sample project bookshop-demo I've added the following annotation:
  @(Common.SideEffects.TargetEntities: ['/AdminService.EntityContainer/Books'])
  action   resetCountOfAllRoles();
to srv/admin-service.cds#L123. When I click resetCountOfAllRoles in the following screen:

The list should refresh to show 0 in the count column. But this happens not automatically. Only when I execute the search again I see the correct result:

Hope that such a behaviour is possible without implementing an extension.
Looking forward for your input.
Best RegardsGregor

Hi experts,
When I was going to generate the Purchase Request over ME51N, I entered the valn price, such as 11,124.5 HKD, SAO system showed the erro message No. DB 738. It showed " You entered a non-numeric character . in a numeric field."

I am currently using the US currency expression to enter the value with decimal points, maybe I am supposed to use the German currency expression? For example "11.124,5"
Best,
Scarlett
Hello Scarlett Wang
Decimal notation does not depend on currency used but on your settings in SU3

Best regards

Is there any chance that you are doing a copy paste in the field and there is a space pasted by mistake? 
Could you also share a screenshot of how the entry you are putting in the system looks? 

Hi,
we want to do SEO for our Cloud Portal site. We only find information on that topic for an outdated version of the portal. 
How could we add e.g. the html file from google webmaster to our site ? Where is the Header and Page Title ? If we check our portal site, these items are alledgedly missing, even when filling in all the titles and names in our Header / Footer public portal page.
Any help or links to blogs are welcome.

Hi Marcus,
The SCP Portal Service has two usages: Cloud Portal (mostly for corporate content [pages and apps] - based on templates) and Fiori Launchapd (to launch cloud applications based on tiles, catalogs and groups). For your purpose I believe the 1st usage (content) is more fit for your SEO design.
Portal page components (header, footer, etc.) are called Web Content Widgets and they can be developed using WebIDE and Cloud Portal Plugin. Once you have full control over the html that is being user by your Cloud Portal site, then you can optimize it for several search engines.
Is this what you are looking for?
Regards,Ivan
Hope you have done this, let me know if you need more help
There is a great article on sap portal about how the cloud portal works. I found some interesting information which you can use in order to optimise your portal here: https://cloudplatform.sap.com/dmp/capabilities/us/product/SAP-Cloud-Platform-Portal/0c501f05-f71e-4945-827b-96f6dc60170a
Hi Team,
I need some solution to find in which entity data got change in Process/Change CR type. I am writing a logic in dynamic badi to route my workflow based on certain logic which i mentioned below. But in process CR i am unable to find only change entity using read_entity_data_all its providing me all entity which i didnt Change and which i changed: -
1) company code/sales level entity changes -> approver2 -> final check
2) other than company code/sales entity level changes-> approver 1 -> approver2 -> final check
3) If above 1& 2 got passed -> approver 1 -> approver2 -> final check
Hello ,
You can use GOVERNANCE API here. 
Class: 'CL_USMD_GOV_API' . 
Method: GET_CREQUEST_DATA
Please find below screen shot for reference & accept this answer if useful.

To make it really correct you should compare current staging values with active area (or analyze change documents), otherwise your solution will not work in case user reverts already saved changes.
If I was malignant tester :-) I would check the case below:
requestor makes changes in CC and in general data, then workflow goes to Approver1 but he/she sends it back, then requestor realize that general data changes were not needed and correct them "back to original values". If you will just check "if entity was touched" workflow goes again to Approver1 but should skip him/her this time 
In Manage Phrases, when click on Create, "Type" is a mandatory field, you cannot click on create without maintain "Type" dropdown. It's a framework bug, I've checked the cds and also tried to set mandatory on UI. The asterisk(*) appears and then the in page blinks and it is missing again -> sap framework overwrites it.
Manage Phrase app-> create -> Phrase -- Type field

Tried to Maintain this field as Mandatory from BE ( In CDS ) and from UI as well. But it is not working properly. Initially showing ( * ) but hiding immediately. Please look into this issue and let me know if have any further query from my side.

Hello all together,I have been trying to publish a service binding of type "OData V4 - UI" for some time now.However, I always get the following error message:

Can anyone tell me what exactly the problem is or how I can fix the error?
Thanks in advance!
Right now the only way would be to change the client settings such that you choose the option:  
Changes without automatic recording  
I was able to reproduce the problem in one of my test systems and will investigate it in more detail next week.  
Hope this helps.  
Kind regards,  
Andre
You can check the client settings in table T000 using transaction SM30.  
It seems that there are two conflicting settings active.

Hi
Please help me understand basic questions regarding data models in signavio.
1.What is the use of a data model? 
2.In prebuilt templates in every business object and event collector, there are temporary tables created, why?
Kindly Share.
Thanks,
Vinod
Hi Vinod kumar,

We are connecting a CRM ABAP instance and a SAP ECC instance with SAP CPI and we are facing 403 issue.

Our CPI flow is using HTTP Adapter and has got a custom User Role (ESBMessaging.send.CustomRoleZ1) assigned. 
We have created an RFC Destination to be able to get an oAuth Bearer Token. 
To call the CPI Flow, we are using ABAP cl_http_client=>create_by_url to get the http client from the main CPI instance.
we add the received token as authorization in the header as well as the Flow name using cl_http_utility=>set_request_uri
we add the payload using lo_http_client->request->set_cdata and send the request to CPI.

we are receiving 403 http code.
When we call CPI flow via POSTMAN it works (http 200)
When we assign the standard User Role ESBMessaging.send the CPI flow, the call works http 200 is received. 
It seems that the call from ABAP System requires the standard User Role ESBMessaging.send to be assigned to the Flow.
Does anyone has any clue about this problem ? Is this cloud platform issue which I can report or is there anything else to be passed the http client object?
I think the problem is with your custom role. How did you created this role and where it is maintained? 
BR, Piotr
I've illuminated the process as shown in the image processoverview.jpg. 
The role is create customuserrole.jpg and assigned to correctly in the service Instance in BTP.
When the iFlow is setup with the standard role iflowwithstandardrole.jpg it works perfectly when calling ABAP.
When changing the iFlow to use the custom role iflowwithcustomrole.jpg it returns 403 forbidden when calling ABAP.
If we take the token that is retrieved while debugging ABAP code and use it in POSTMAN it works. 
So we suspect it has to do with the way Abap Call is internally done. 
BTW: header attribute 'Authorization' is set like this: 'Bearer<space><token>'
Dear Mustapha, 
Normally when I face these issues I start with the following items 
Hopefully this is giving you some information you can use to validate at which step the issue occurs using a custom role.
Regards, 
Jordy
Thank you all for your responses. Very much appreciated. We tried with a new role `CustomRoleZ1` without any reference to ESBMessaging.Send and still not working. We are wondering if there are any parameters we might need to give to the http client object from ABAP perspective that would help?
Hi Mustapha,
When I was asking about the role assignment in BTP I was referring to the following... if the service instance does not have that custom role assigned then I do believe you will receive a 403.

Regards,
Ryan Crosby
Thank you Ryan. The user has both roles. the CustomRoleZ1 and ESBMessaging.send. 
The weird think is that the call works when the iFlow has the role ESBMessaging.send assigned, regardless whether the user has this role assigned in the instance or not.
 
Do any companies automate either part of all of the CO tasks during month-end close? If so, which transactions are automated and is there a method used to link transactions together? We would like to automate some of the longer running transactions, such as KSU5-Assessment Cycles, KSS2-Actual Cost Splitting, KSII-Execute Actual Price Calculation, CON2-Revaluation at Actual Prices, KKAO-WIP Calc, KKS1-Variance Calc, CO88-Order Settlement, CK40N-Costing Run for Current Cost, KE27-Periodic Valuation, MRF1-FIFO Calculation, COHV-Production order TECO/CLOSE, and CO99-Close Maintenance Orders. 
 
We would appreciate any guidance with the following:
 
 1) Reducing SAP processing time
 
 2) Reducing the amount of time Finance personnel spends executing transactions (especially transactions that need to be run one plant at a time - CON2, KKAO, KKS1, CO88 - or transactions that have several steps, such as CK40N)
 
 3) Reducing validation time (ie: ensuring direct cost center balances are zero) 
 
A couple of things we are reviewing currently are:
 
 a. Assessment Cycles (KSU5) - Cycle run groups and a batch job to run all cycles for all plants at once (Concern: How to ensure they run in the correct order?)
 
 b. WIP Calc (KKAO), Variance Calc (KKS1), & Order Settlement (CO88) - Set up batch job similar to production and for the variant use period in TVARV table minus 1 to run for prior period (Concern: Is this possible without development?)
 
Any help you provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Hello experts,
Please advise on following matter: 
We are implementing HR mini master for client, and primary HR system will be their current system (not SAP), and clients want solution where their HR team wont be needed to work in SAP.
So, basically we need to make integration with their current HR software and SAP HCM mini master to transfer newly entered employees and departures from company (IT0000/01/02), bank account info (0009), and contact info (0105) for other implemented module functionalities. 
What is the way to implement this integration, I have no previous integration experience, but in SPRO i noticed this part so I am wondering how can I use it: 

All answers and suggestions are welcome :)
Did you check the documentation associated with these Nodes?

Can someone confirm what the frequency of overdue email notifications is in learning? 
If we set the reminder period to 10 days, does that mean an email will be sent every 10 days after the item has expired until it is complete?
Hi Colleen,
I recommend that you review the following link:
https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/2330530#APM
has information about notifications.
Regards!
I would say yes if you have the autmatic process set up to run daily and you don't have a threshold entered. This help page also has a lot of good information. This is the help for the Learning Expiration Email Notification automatic process.
https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_SUCCESSFACTORS_LEARNING/5fae31b1299d4033b665edabea7b9087/ef8197a2373744a5bda5a2561a8e7c63.html
"For example, if you type 30 in Threshold and 7 in Reminder Period, then a user receives up to four notifications (one message every 7 days for 30 days before the required or next action date) that remind them to complete the item. That is, if you run the automatic process every day, then the user receives four reminders; if you run the process every 2 weeks, then the user receives two reminders."
Hi Experts,
We have formatted text Notes in Visit and Appointment and I need to show that in a custom EC inside account. So for all the visit and appointment associated with an account we need to show the formatted text in EC.
I have created a custom BO and with as many transient field of type string and created an EC with the same. I also have some requirement like, each notes should be shown in separate box with some background color. I have achieved all but the issue is when user enter any text with "text-alignment" (center, right, etc) it is not showing properly in EC, texts are all left aligned.
<p> tags is not supporting the text. If I have any <p> tags then all the text is showing outside of the box in EC.
<span> tag is not aligning the text.
Just to test if this is supported I have hardcoded the below line of code to see if the alignment works.
substr = "<span style=\"text-align: center\"> Test alignment </span>";

substr = "<p style=\"text-align: center\"> Test alignment </p>"; // Alignment is working here but text is not showing outside of the box because of the <p> tag

Do you have any suggestion on how to deal with "text-align" tags from formatted text and how to store them in string.
Thanks in advance.

I currently fail to see the "import Visio" option.
This KBA: 3160224 - Import Visio Missing
says go to support launchpad, without any detail about what product/component or what magic words to add to get the capability.
This KBA refers to the earlier one: 160224 - Import Visio Missing
and this 160224 also talks about some group mailbox.So after explaining what we've found - the question... how can we get Visio import capability active for our Signavio SAAS instance?Thanks for the guidance/suggestions. Wallace
Hi Wallace Henry,
Thanks for your request. The Visio import feature needs to be aligned between you and the SAP Signavio Support team as they would need to activate the feature in your workspace. For this to happen, you would need to create an incident in the SAP ONE Support Launchpad. Please select your SAP Signavio Process Manager instance as the feature would be activated exactly there.
You can find detailed information on how to raise a support incident as well as several other helpful resources in the SAP Signavio Onboarding Resource Center.
Hope this helps. Feel free to reach out again if you need further help.

I need to call an API, which is OData, from the ABAP RFC function module, which I implemented, but the user wants to call it in batches.
Is there any way to call batch requests from the ABAP program? 
Or 
How to include the data highlighted below in the HTTP Client class.

Handle it the same as for any other HTTP request:

Hi all , 
We have few open G/L line items posted in foreign currency USD , which we want to clear in F-03. When we try to clear the line items , the balance in the clearing currency shows as 0 ,but when we click on change to local currency the system shows an amount in the Assigned value . This value seems to be coming from the exchange rate differences calculated by the program . 
How can we clear off this difference and carry out the clearing . What is the difference in clearing in local currency and clearing these documents in the foreign currency USD by entering the currency as USD in the header data. We want to do the clearing only in local currency and do not want to recognize any forex differences. 
Please advise .

HiWe have created a new tab on PPM Item and created Custom fields and done the nexessary fields but they are appearing for all PPM Items, unlike in PS (Proj Definition where these appear only for Project with company code 1040)So the behaviour is inconsistent, we do not want the custom fields to appear on any other company code (excpet 1040). PPM item type and portfolio is same.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
Hi,
In Portfolio Management the field attributes - like visibility of a field - can be controlled generally or withmore granularity by Item-Type.The field attributes which are maintained for a PS-Project are not considered in Portfolio Management for theitem. There exists no connection between the field control of Project System and Portfolio Management.When you would like to control the field attributes depending on the company code you can use an implementationof BAdI RPM_PROJ_CUST_FIELDS with method ATTRIBUTE_MODIFY.

1.when I config Credit Management->Define Checking Rules, we found Individual Step->030 has been maintained 'Credit Horizon in Days'->999 and click Credit Segment  has been maintained Credit Horizon->999, I want to add a credit segment and maintain it for 2 months, could you please kindly tell me how to modify the configuration and the modification will not affect the existing credit segment.
2. I want to add a credit segment and maintain it for 2 months, could you please tell me whether the unit of the Credit Horizon is day or month or week, how to define the unit of the Credit Horizon.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about the SAP Support user and program here.
Hello, Q1: Per segment credit horizon settingYou correctly found that there are two places to maintain the Credit Horizon days on the 030 credit check step.On the credit check step itself you can maintain a general setting which will be valid for all credit segments, except those for which you specifically set other credit horizon days.For that you need to drill down to the segment level settings on the Check Rule -> Check Step -> Credit Segment.Here you insert a new credit segment and define the number of days that you want to use with that segment. You can confirm that your changes are effective and didn't change other segments if you open transaction UKM_BP and look at some example business partners. On the Credit Segment tab the system will display the Credit Horizon end date and number of days.
Q2: Unit of credit horizonWith SAP Credit Management (FSCM) the credit horizon is set in days and the end of the credit horizon is a specific date.You cannot change the unit of the credit horizon, it is used in days.To set 2 months credit horizon you will need to use 60 days (or 61 days).(This is different compared to the old ECC classic credit management design, there you had days, weeks, months.) For further information you can refer to KBAs:2939371 - Dynamic Limit Check with Credit Horizon in SAP Credit Management (FSCM)2926009 - Credit check step per segment customizing in SAP Credit Management (FSCM) Best regards,EdinaSAP

2. Second time when we visit LaunchPad page

As a workaround you can add a rule in OnReturning of your main page to redraw the object header.  In my testing that seems to fix the problem.
Hi Bill,
Yes this our main page, every time we come back to this page using back button we are having this problem.

what was the problem ? 
1) got ( object id & folder id ) in sood table using ( instid_a , typeid_a , catid_a ) in srgbtbrel table
2) use FM so_obejct_read to get content information from ( object id & folder id )
3) convert format as ( soli -> solix -> xstring -> binary) using class cl_bcs_convert & FM scms_xstring_to_binary.
4) create url using FM DP_CREATE_URL

Dear All,
I want to understand how the available material quanity in Batch determination screen. As i have 3 sales order created and based on the available Qty in MMBE. MMBE Qty is different then available Qty in batch determination.
For eg:- if you see in MMBE for Material i have 3 batch and each bach has a respective Qty. There is no open order or open delivery for this material.

Now I have created 3 differnet order :-
Order :- 564129850 with 550 Qty 
Order :- 564129857 with 597 qty
Order :- 564129858 with 1730 Qty.
Now when i try to create a delivery for order 564129858 with 1730 qty, it shows the correct Qvailable qty in all the batches as shown below:-

Now the issue is even if i dont save this delivery, if i create a delivery for other 2 orders - 564129850 & 564129857 then only for the first batch it is showing correct qty for remaining 2 batch it is showing different qty. I want to understand how this available quanity is getting determine in delivery batch determination screen.
So now as per below screenshot if I create a delivery for order :- 564129850 and if you see in available Quanity only for 1st batch it is showing correct qty for remaining 2 batch it is showing 1097. I dnt know how this 1097 is calculated. it should be 1126 and 1728. 
Same if i create a order for 564129857 it is showing in correct value and that too some random figure. 

Could you please help to understand how this values are determined in Available quanity in batch determination screen.
Thanks,

Rikin

Hi gurus, how can I set BODS job to read a folder on Linux, and store all file names in a variable, and send an email including all the file names? Thanks!!!
Greetings LeeFung Wu,
1. Create an external script that you can call from the job to get the list of files in a particular directory
Example: below i have a Linux script called list_files.sh that takes in the target directory as an input parameter
2. In the designer create a Job and in the Job add a Script object. In the script you need to use the exec function to call the Linux shell script.
3. Output from running the above script

4. Mail Sent successfully

Please note that smtp_to() function does not support html emails and so the message body will be a one liner statement. to use html emails you need to use a different mailing utility that you can call using the exec function.

Not 100% sure but I think its the SAC-Add-in product ID and should remain as shown in the document. As you are using powershell to deploy the Add-in centrally, powershell needs to identify the add-in and that's where the product id parametr is used.

I'm trying to use reports exported from Spectrum as templates to build new reports with additional info. The downloaded reports open up a new connection (jdbc:sqlserver:...) instead of using the Spectrum connection that I use to create new reports. Neither I or my IT dept have the credentials for the jdbc connection. ( the connections are also listed multiple times and we aren't sure why - maybe that is part of the issue?) Any help would be appreciated!
cr-connections.png
Note the list is under My Connections, it's just listing the connections used in reports you have opened.
Select the Spectrum connection and fill in the log on info and it should work.
Or go down and find JDBC connection and fill in the connection info, you do require the connection info.
Hello, 
I am having the same issue. I am able to select Spectrum in my list (it's an ODBC connection) and use the report fields. However, when I try to "Preview", Crystal wants me to connect to JDBC- which I don't have set up and have no information for. Why does it keep trying to connect as a JDBC when I have the ODBC set up and selected? 
You likely need to contact Spectrum and ask them how to...
hi, I'm new to BO, and trying to edit a variable in BO 4.3 Crystal Report. When I hover on the object, I see the formula (as shown in the screenshot), I want to edit that, but I don't see any option to do so. There's no option to right click, there's no button to edit this formula.. am I missing something, or...?
I'm on BO 4.3 SP3 in the Dev environment. I'm using Microsoft Edge Version 110.0.1587.46 (Official build) (64-bit). I cannot test this with any other browser as that is not allowed as per company policy. Pls advise. 

Do you have the right to edit the report? If so, you need to select the design mode first
Having not worked with these reports before, I am not sure where to start and I do not want to change anything that may have unintended effects, this is what the client wrote to us: 
"When we use reports that are built in Logicity (Crystal reports) and it pulls data from the tables in Visual Manufacturing . . . are there any fields in those reports that look at the part maintenance data table that pull the part numbers AA-AAAA-AAAAA . . . the 4 middle digits concern me bc if any reports are built to only pull 4 digits in this field we may need to update the reports to start looking for 5 digits in this field.When we started using part numbers separated by dashes, we were below 1000. Well 20+ years later we are close to 10,000 in this particular portion of the part number. I need to make sure our reports will pull that field correctly from Visual when we cross the 10,000 threshold. I hope this makes sense. It’s hard to describe if you’re not looking at report or running one . . ."  
We have no way of knowing how Visual Manufacturing/Logicity has implemented their reports.  If possible, I would contact their tech support to ask this question.  If that's not possible, you'll have to just look at the reports to determine whether this is an issue.

Where I find a merge module to integrate in my setup installation?
Hello,
Unfortunately we follow Microsoft's End of Life for Visual Studio so there hasn't been a version that supports VS 6 in 10+ years.
CR no longer installs the SDK, it's a separate download now.
CR's latest end of life info:
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/SAP+Crystal+Products+-+End+of+Mainstream+Maintenance+Dates
To get the CR .NET installer for VS 2010->2022 you can get all the info from here:
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/Crystal+Reports%2C+Developer+for+Visual+Studio+Downloads
There is no direct replacement for your old app to .NET
There is 2 .NET C# samples on the WIKI page.
I'll move your post over to the CR for VS tag so if you have any questions please post there, search first, lots of info there.

Hello,
All of our computers running applications (64 bits) created using Visual Studio 2019 that use Crystal Reports are running under the following runtime (I believe is SP29):
We are in the process of updating to Visual Studio 2022, to get things going, we enabled Crystal Reports in Visual Studio 2022 by executing CRforVS6413SP33_0-80007712.EXE .
My question is: Is it possible to compile Visual Studio 2022 solutions that use Crystal Reports (I believe is SP33) and expect them to work with the old runtime (I believe is SP29)? Or must I update all the computers to use the latest CR runtime?
I tried it and things seem to work with the old runtime but I am not sure if I am asking for trouble.
Thanks.
When we update the references to new version which required the 64 runtime with version of (13.0.33.xx). 
In the Crystal for VS wiki, look for the links to WinFormCRViewer.zip and KB article 2719939.  This is information about mixing versions of the SDK.
-Dell
Hi Rene,
It's recommended to upgrade your project, rebuild and redistribute the runtime.
I wrote a blog on how to:
https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/30/upgrading-a-visual-studio-2008-2019-.net-project-with-the-latest-cr-.net-sdk-packages/comment-page-1/#comment-660614
You can use the Redirect as Dell suggested but since it appears to be an internal app I highly recommend upgrading all PC's with the SP 33 runtime.
Note also VS 2022 is a 64 bit application so updating the runtime by default you should set your project to x64 and not use AnyCPU.
Also note in the link Dell gave you there is a new Export to XLXS that requires you Report be updated to CR 2020, also 64 bit, as well.
And be sure to set Copy Local = False for all CR runtime, you may run into side by side issues if you previously did not do that. There should be no CR dll's in your \bin folder.

Since existing Payment Medium Format: 74 - SEPA Credit Transferformat with SEPA delivered from BYD does not cover all needs from payment transaction we need to extend file for payment. For this purpose we create our own file with avalible setup from Fine Tune - Outgoing Bank Transfers – Edit Payment File Structures
This setup give's us only output in flat file in .txt format. We need to create .xml file with differrent structure from existig SEPA. How to create costum .xml file for payment?
Is it possible to copy existing SEPA file delivered by SAP in our solution and make some change?
I have found an enhancement option called PaymentToPaymentFileConversion but I am not entierly sure if that is what I am supposed to use and how to use it so if someoen has examples or guides it would be useful.
Hey I forgot about this thread in all the mess, my bad.
What we did to solve this is we used a standard enhancement called PaymentToPaymentFileConversion. There is a PDF tutorial on SAP JAM - https://jam4.sapjam.com/groups/3odgd4UDtB1KH4dgKGmnBS/documents/ttKHBu2rnK6tkZL0zo0pIW/slide_viewer
Unfortunately it doesnt let me put it here as attachment, but I have the PDF and if you like I cant send it to you via e-mail to speed things up.
After you implement it, which can be confusing the first time around, you can code your xml structure here using ABSL. Its not ideal but it gets the job done for us. Make sure to follow the instructions exacly as they are and create a project template and edit it with a PDI user, because only PDI user will have the options you need.
In the end it looks something like this:

So its similar as if you did it by hand in the activity list, but its much easier and faster and you do get more flexibility here. One issue is that the generated file is not of type xml, but for now that wasnt too big of problem for our customers since they download it localy and save it as xml anyways. I have no idea why its not possible to make the file of different formats - or perhaps I just missed something, it wouldnt be the first time :)
Best of luck
Hi, 
I have the exact same requirement, from my understanding : 
- you can not make xml through Fine Tune - Outgoing Bank Transfers – Edit Payment File Structures (it is written in SAP Docs that is flat file only)
- enhancement option called PaymentToPaymentFileConversion is the equivalent in PDI of creating a new structure in Fine Tune - Outgoing Bank Transfers (or maybe it is only for non localized country). 
I am also really interested to know if we can make a copy of copy SAP existing SEPA file because it is quite long to enter and not obvious to bind to the correct data
Hello all,
Did you meanwhile found some answers on this topic?
What I understood - the existing SEPA file delivered by SAP in our solution cannot be copied and adjusted. But I assume once this is setup in SAP ByD (using PDI) it can be copied and re-used?
How much work is it to setup first time, and how hard is it to do? Is that comparable to finetuning?
Anyone ever thought of sharing solutions, it that even possible?
Thank you!

Mic
Hi Abap guru,
I need to loop the internal table where the racct in a certain range, but it will take a lot of code if i hard coded every single range. I'm new to abap so i don't know if its possible or not. Here's my code : 
DATA: r_range1  TYPE RANGE OF hkont,
      wa_range1 LIKE LINE OF r_range1.

LOOP AT it_range INTO wa_range.
  PERFORM f_count.
ENDLOOP.

FORM f_count.
LOOP AT it_fazg INTO wa_fazg WHERE racct IN r_range1." before
  LOOP AT it_itb1 INTO wa_itb1 WHERE racct IN wa_range-rname. " it gets me an error
  "RNAME is not an internal table"
    " calculations
  ENDLOOP.
ENDFORM.
The it_range only consist of one row of data (rname) like r_range1, r_range2, r_range3.
Please help me solve this problem. Thanks in advance!
Try 
or use ASSIGN
Please ask complete questions.
To clarify your question and to make it simple, you'd better post a minimal reproducible code like this:
Syntax error at the line LOOP AT itab INTO wa, and you don't know how to solve.
The solution should be more clear if you debug your code.
The answer depends on the ABAP version you are using.
This should always work:
The proposal by Raymond works from an ABAP release > 7.52 (I don't know which one exactly but it's easy to check):
We are running One Step STO process (647/101) using OBD between two plants. Both are batch managed at plant level.
The requirement is to automatically during the VL02N-Goods Issue to create a new batch in the receiving plant, not adapt the batch from the sending plant.
Is that possible in the standard. I was debugging all day but did not get it to work.
Thanks for the help

Hello, 
according to my undertanding the setting for Incoterm Location Stage Building in the TM Logistics Integration Profile only makes sense if I can make it dependent on the incoterm. Example: In case of Incoterm FOB the second stage is not planning relevant. In case of CFR the second stage is releveant for planning.
So how can I solve this problem? An answer from the solution architect would be really appreciated!!
Hey Thomas...Did you ever find the solution for this? I have scenarios similar to this where I have to plan only a certain stage or stages and both stage profile and incoterms doesnt make sense.
For a sales order , the TM relevance stage is from Source to Incoterm ..so assign a logistics integration profile with Source Location to Incoterm Location .
For PO ...depends on whether external procurement or STO ..if STO then assign assign a logistics integration profile with two active stages else with Incoterm to Destination..
Dear experts, I have a question about Attributes in IBP Time profile such as DAYWEIGHT, WEEKWEIGHT, MONTHWEIGHT, MONTHOFQUATER & WEEKOFQUATER.
I understand the concept of how to complete this data and that it is useful for disaggregations, when the data from a KF stored is loaded in a period, for example, a month, when it is broken down to a week and has the factor, it is broken down correctly.
But, in time profile of planning area of a client, I have seen that they have not maintained the values of the attributes, not even WEEKWEIGHT and for example KG ACTUALSQTY has assigned weekweght, ACTUALSQTy is updated from data integation and planning level has a technical week as a root.
What happens if the attributes in the time profile were not completed? Is it useful only for those KFs that are updated from a higher planning level to the lower period of the time profile (example KF update in Month not in Week)?
Or does it have an impact on the calculations of the algorithms, whether they are Heuristic, Forecast, etc?
Thank you very much for your help in advance.
Zule
HI Zulema Luz Calero
If those time attributes are blank, which is what you will mostly get in clients IBP system , then this means it will be equal split among all the buckets. Unless any bucket have a value it is equal split in all buckets 
Thank you Ayan
Hello,

If i go to VL02N and open a delivery and then simply click on SAVE without doing any changes, transaction shows a success message like Delivry & has been saved. In actual case no new changes exists for the delivery.

Is there any way to check in copy control routine (VOFM) that any changes actually did for the delivery?

Regards,
Hari
Check whether any custom developments are carried out using BAPI of User-exits which does some changes while open and save the delivery.  For monitoring the changes, you can use the  method "DELIVERY_FINAL_CHECK" of badi "LE_SHP_DELIVERY_PROC".
Hi Hari,
Can you please share how you fixed this?

Hi All
Is there any special setting to enable Mobile Notification on pending Approval transaction? 
Example User will receive message notification on Mobile Device like a SMS after which he will login SAP in his Mobile Phone to approve transaction.

Thank You.
Hi Gurus, 

we are implementing payroll indonesia with monthly period 16 - 15 ( not 1 - 30/31)
when the schema call NAMTD, why some employee shows zero value while others not, 
ex : 
period : 01.2013 (16.12.2012 - 15.01.2013)
employee A : 
 hire 16.12.2012 
employee B : 
 hire 01.01.2013 
both employee's date type 01 already set to with the same hire date

why NAMTD values always shows zero for employee A only, while employee B just fine
did i miss some configuration steps?
please helpp..

thanks in advance
What's the schema name for indonesia ? and what's the NAMTD .. can you provide screenshot ?
Let try report to compare and find some master data you missed:
S_AHR_61015785 - Infotype Overview for Employee 
After that check document: http://harrypoe.wordpress.com/2008/09/25/sap-py-id-how-to-define-projection-factor-402/
NAMTY = Normalized number of active month in current fiscal year
NAMTD = Normalize number of active month until specific date in the current fiscal year

hope it's useful

Regards!

Please notice me, if your problem has been solved. bcs i have same problem. thnks
I have a working WADL for consuming a Graph API method, however - the response json can return multiple formats depending on the result returned. So when successful, status 204 is returned with an empty body. But if an error occurs, there is json in the body which conforms to an xsd defined as "error".
e.g.
		<resource path="/v1.0/users/{userid}">
			<param name="userid" style="template"/>
			<method name="PATCH" id="UpdateUser">
				<doc xml:lang="en" title="UpdateUser"/>
				<request >
					<representation mediaType="application/json" element="UpdateUser"/>
				</request>
				<response status="204">
				</response>
				<response status="400 401 404 500 501 503">
					<representation mediaType="application/json" element="error"/>
				</response>
			</method>
		</resource>
When in data services, it will only pick up the error schema output. If the response status is 204 with an empty body, the job fails with the error [JSNONParser]Missing value at line:<1> at column: <10>.
If I remove the error response, the job fails and I have no way to parse the error response.
Is there a way to get this working as expected?
Secondly, is there a way to get the http status code back into Data Services from the header? Graph API doesn't include it in the body. If the job fails, the error goes into AL_ERROR_MSG , but this is too short to contain the JSON response (256 char).
Any help appreciated.
Hi Stephen Leary, 
You need to implement Min Occurrence & Max Occurrence in the XSD Schema. So that the .WADL file will handle the data dynamically without giving you an error. 
Try to run your batch job with the full trace and see how the input response is getting generated in the trace log.

Hi community,
I have crearted a CDS View in S/4HANA and trying to expose it via SDI using ABAP adapter.
Creation of a virtual table was successful. However, when I tried to create a replica on it, the following error was raised.
CREATE REMOTE SUBSCRIPTION is not supported on this table - the table doesn't have CDC capability
It seems that the underlying table does not support CDC capability. 
My question is, how I can check which tables support CDC capability. Is there any t-code available for this?
Steps
1. Create a CDS view with @Analytics.dataExtraction.delta.changeDataCapture.automatic : true

2. Create a virtual table
create virtual table "FVT_ZI_DEMO_CONSIGNMENTSTOCK" at "S4HANA2022SPS00"."<NULL>"."<NULL>"."ABAP_CDS.ZI_DEMO_CONSIGNMENTSTOCK$E";
3. Add a shared replica (error)
alter virtual table "FVT_ZI_DEMO_CONSIGNMENTSTOCK" add shared replica;

FYI. creation of snapshot replica was successful.
Best regards,
Mio

Hi Mio,
I copied your code in my internal system to create a general CDS ( but not a view entity). Its delta is working fine:
3195275 - Customizing ABAP CDS CDC: does not support deltas
When I process SAP OSS ticket for the similar issue, I would usually follow this note to check.
Regards,
Hi Mio,
Have a look at this blob there are certain annotations that have been missed, more information here https://blogs.sap.com/2019/12/16/cds-based-data-extraction-part-ii-delta-handling/

To check if a HANA table supports CDC (Change Data Capture) capability, you can use the system views SYS.M_CDC_SUPPORTED_TABLES and SYS.M_CDC_ENABLED_TABLES. The former lists all tables in the system that support CDC, while the latter lists all tables that have CDC enabled.
 @Mio Yasutake, from the definition, CDC should be supported. But may has issue due to other incorrect definition. To get a more accurate information, please check the result using report RODPS_REPL_TEST with Last Delta mode for this CDS.

I can't download crystal report for visual studio. I get sorry page request.
Where are you trying to download from?  There are two options for downloading from the Crystal for VS wiki:
The link in the blue "Download Crystal Reports developer, for Microsoft Visual Studio" should take you to a registration page.  After you fill it out, it will download the most recent .exe that you install to integrate with VS.
Just below that link, is a "softwaredownloads" URL that will take you to a page where you can download the most recent version of the SDK along with some older versions.  You'll need the "Installation Package" .exe file download to get the integration with VS for the version you're using.  This page also has links for downloading the various types of runtime installs that are available for use when deploying your completed application.

ok I have account from one year and I already registered and I'm downloading from this link .
SAP Crystal Reports, version for Visual Studio 
but I get this message: our request for information is being reviewed. Once approved, you’ll receive an e-mail with additional instructions. 
I trying to download crystal report to see if there is server version or any updates because i have problem on my system, the system is work fine for period of time maybe 2 day or three or a week but a day when I need to print the system is hanging I try to reset the "printlimitjob" default value 75 to -1 or any large value the issue still also I tied to close, dispose the report after the printing code and collect also the same issue 
please if there is any solution to this problem, I get tired while trying to find the solution. 
Hi Belal,
Download SP 33 from here:
https://origin.softwaredownloads.sap.com/public/site/index.html
Note the version of Visual Studio installer, one for VS 2010->2019 and a new 64 bit installer for VS 2022.
Uninstall which ever CR for VS you including the MSI packages and then install the EXE on your Development PC only, don't install the MSI packages manually. The installer will prompt at the end to install the 32 or 64 bit runtime, click OK. When it's done the installer will close.
You MUST install by right clicking the the setup.exe and Selecting Run as Administrator, even if you are logged in as one.
As for the issue you are having I would check your Anti-virus software to see if it's blocking access.
Try right clicking on Visual Studio Icon also and select Run as Administrator, it could be it's being blocked also.
Don
sir i get the same message ( our request for information is being reviewed. Once approved, you’ll receive an e-mail with additional instructions).
and i can't install the SP 33 from the link. for issue I have installed the system setup file which is developed using VB.net on multiple client PC standalone for different customers, the system is working normally for a week or maybe month depending on how many the customer print reports. after I tried multiple solutions as I write in previous message.
I don't notice what the antivirus message. please i need help
mmmm, that is odd. I'll ping one of the Admin's and send this link to him to check your account....
Hi, 
My goal is to migrate Crystal Reports from a desktop Windows Form application to a React developed website. The website and database are in the same network. In the future, we might put everything into cloud. Crystal Report developers claimed only Visual Studio(.Net) and Java SDK Eclipse will display Crystal Report in web page. These are too limited consider we have different type of web site developed. 
Two questions:
- Is it possible to review Crystal Reports in a React web site? (developed by IDE Visual Studio Code with TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript)
- Is the interactive parameters still capable in web page? I don't prefer to convert the rpt into pdf, then display the pdf in web page. We still desire parameters interaction with end-user on the web page.
For sure, similar questions had been asked before, just wonder if any suggestion or proved of concept has been swirling in our community. Welcome blue-sky thinking too.
Thanks
I found the mark up code and code behind in Page_Load don't behave the same. Even they are written in the same logic. The problem is once click Export button in Export window, the Page_Load is called again, CrystalReportViewer1.ReportSource = cryRpt is re-assigned, after that export functionality does not work. While the mark up code works well. 
(1) With code behind as following, The export button is there and clickable, but will not export anything.
 protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
 { 
 ReportDocument cryRpt = new ReportDocument();
 cryRpt.Load(Server.MapPath("~/crystalReport.rpt"));
 cryRpt.SetDatabaseLogon(........);
 CrystalReportViewer1.ReportSource = cryRpt;
}
if I add IsPostBack check, I can export file successfully, however, the database logon window appears. Any idea what causes the logon appear? How to prevent the logon?
 if (!IsPostBack)
 { 
 CrystalReportViewer1.ReportSource = cryRpt; 
 }
(2) mark up code to acheive the same goal. The exported file shows up.
 <div>
 <CR:CrystalReportViewer ID="CrystalReportViewer1" runat="server" AutoDataBind="true" HasRefreshButton="True" UseActiveX="false" 
 ReportSourceID="CrystalReportSource1"/>
 <CR:CrystalReportSource ID="CrystalReportSource1" runat="server">
 <Report FileName="crystalReport.rpt"></Report>
 </CR:CrystalReportSource>
 </div>
As Dell noted only runtime for CR is .NET or Java and our .NET runtime will only work with 4.7 or 4.8 framework, we don't support CORE, so not sure why the AI said it would work.
You will need to build your DLL using .NET and then call it from Java, if that's possible, never tried it myself.
Also, don't use the Nuget packages we don't support it.
Get the runtime from my Wiki and download link:
https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/Crystal+Reports%2C+Developer+for+Visual+Studio+Downloads
The only two SDKs that are available are .NET and Java.  If you're deploying to IIS on Windows, you could create either a .NET or a Java Class to wrap call the reports from your website.  If you're not deploying on Windows, you would have to use a Java class.
The latest versions of both SDKs no longer use Flash for the parameters screen, so you could run them interactively. 
-Dell
I would use WireShark or Fiddler and trace what is happening when you click the export button.
Seems either you or the app doesn't have rights to export to the destination.
Also, CR .NET is not supported using CORE framework, you must select 4.7 or 4.8 Framework to build your CR project.
Hi Na,
Great you have it working, almost.... Post back is usually required to keep the report in scope.
You can enable our database logging component:

Hi,
I am currently using abstract entity which gives me a popup with input parameters when I click on a custom action from the list report. Here, I can only have static fields on the popup. But my requirement is to have the popup with dynamic fields .
For example, if I have 3 material listed on the list report and I select all 3 materials and click on the custom action, the popup should show me selected materials ( in this case 3 materials) along with a input parameter against each material to enter the quantity for them.
Please let me know if this is possible using restful ABAP , if not what would be the best way to achieve this.
Appreciate your inputs.
Hello SAP Integration Gurus,
I am trying to resolve the following mapping issue with UseOneAsMany node function for the following but stumling across errors despite trying various functions with in Node Functions. 
Your help/advice is much appreciated. Thanks in advance.
Issue 1: In some cases in the payload we get just the 'OrgUnit' with no corresponding 'OrgUnitDetails' node. Meaning OrgUnits node and underlying child elements at Target should only display when 'OrgUnit' has underlying OrgUnitDetails (i.e. OrgUnit 99660043 with No underlying OrgUnit Details should be omiited). Please see Mapping for Issue 1 below.
Issue 2 : As you can see from the Source structure below at times we are getting 'OrgUnit Details' (Child nodes) twice for the same 'OrgUnit' with multiple/varying start and end dates along with other changes.
e.g. sender sends the same OrgUnit multiple times to cater different start and end dates and other changes (if any)
e.g. OrgUnit 99660043 has multiple start/end date as follows Start Date 1 : 2022.12.04 End Date1 : 2022.12.31 and then again Start Date 2 : 01.01.2023 | End Date 2 : 31.12.9999. Please see Mapping for Issue 2 below.
Source

Mapping for Issue 1 -> Below is the mapping for OrgUnit to omit/discard the OrgUnits with NO underlying OrgUnit Detail nodes

Mapping for Issue 2 -> OrgUnitDetails mapping to cater for multiple start and end dates for the same OrgUnit 

Hello Sushanth,
What you are doing is everything right just add two mapWithDefault in the last two input nodes of useOneasMany.
See what is happening here, in your main node "OrgUnits" on the receiver side you are using createIf which is creating SUPPRESS in your node. That means that the node will create for OrgUnit which is not having OrgUnitDetails but it will not populate in the output. It is getting suppressed.

And when you do the mapping of your OrgUnit the OrgUnit which does not have the OrgUinitDetails is not able to find the context where it should repeat because that is getting null (If you see the display queue at "OrgUnitDetails"). just add mapWithDetault it will find the correct context. and for the suppressed node it will not populate in output.

Please accept the answer if it gets resolved.

Hello,
 I am developing a WPF application (Visual Studio) and use CrystalReportsViewer to preview the report with a picture in it. When I click at built-in export button in CrystalReportsViewer and select type "Microsoft Excel (XLSX) (*.xlsx)", the application closed unexpectedly without any error or exception even I already tried to caught unhandled exception. How do I fix this?
 See Screenshort
 More information:
 - I can export successfully if select type "Microsoft Excel (XLSX) (*.xlsx)" without the picture in the report.
 - I can export successfully if select type "Microsoft Excel - Data Only (XLSX) (*.xlsx)" with the picture in the report.
 - I can export successfully if select type "Microsoft Excel (XLS) (*.xls)" with the picture in the report.

Hello,
You must save the report in CR 2020 to be able to use that new export format.
I never checked the WPF viewer when I had R&D update the SDK so not sure if they added it or not to that viewer.

Don't install both the EXE and MSI's, not needed, installer will install the x86 or x64 depending on which version of VS and installer you are using.

Hear are settings for connections: 
What should we do for solving problem?
Olga,
you've got the exception due to timeout on acquiring Connection object from a connection pool, not due to timeout on connecting to DB - it can happen because of several reasons: all connection objects are taken or there is a problem with obtaining a new connection.  Thus, your next action should be to verify if you have any JDBC errors indicating a problem with DB connectivity, and investigate, why all Connection objects are taken and what Threads are keeping them busy, for example, by making thread dumps, when the issue occurs again.

Dear Friends

Here we are stuck in a situation where one of my consultants close assets fiscal year by using the Tcode AJAB (which is not suppose to be done till march 2009)

Pls give us some inputs so as to reopen the fiscal year of the assets

many thanks in advance

Dear Expert, 
There is a chance to post in a closed Asset Fiscal Year ex 2021 
While you already have 2 open Asset Fiscal Year, such as:
- 2022
- 2023 
Is a customer business requirement to transfer value in Asset during 2021 and run depreciation's, while we have open 2022 and 2023. 
There is a work around since only 2 asset fiscal year permit the system 
Thanks in advance

Hello experts.We are trying to set up an integration between SuccessFactors and Azure AD using a hybrid environment with AD on Prem as well. We are currently running into an issue where we are not getting any job information on future hires, although it says that they have an active employment. In our test environment this is working just fine, and the set-up with permissions is exactly the same. 
We have tried with this syntax: 
$query= 'https://api012.successfactors.eu/odata/v2/EmpJob?$filter=userId eq 104362&$format=json'
For active employments this gives us the expected data, but it doesn't give any data for future employments. This issue means that we can't see any data before the actual start date of the employee and can't take any actions before that (like sending out e-mails).
Do you know what might be causing this?
It might be good to know that this query dose not work in test either, but if we do a preview of the provisioning all the data is there, which it is not in the live environment.

Can you add background music to demos within SAP Enable Now?
Or do you need to add the music separately and then the voice?
I have tried to have the background music on while I recorded audio and you could either barely hear the music or you could not hear me. 
Hi Vee,
It is possible to add background music to a Book and Book Pages but not Simulations.  To add the background music to a Book and Book Pages:
1. Open the first Book Page in the Book in Producer2. Click the icon on the toolbar that looks like a puzzle piece and select Audio.  This adds an audio object at the top of the page3. With the audio object selected, select the background music file in the Source field4. Set the Sound Channel value to Book Sound5. Make sure that Start Automatically is turned on and you are good to go.
RegardsShane
You're probably just using the Page Sound (on the Page Object). If you use an Audio object, SAP Enable Now provides five 'channels' you can play the audio in (and play audio concurrently in any or all of these channels), and you can control the volume separately for each of these.
The Book Sound plays throughout all Book Pages in a Book (assuming you start it in the first Book Page, as Shane notes). Page Sound is specific to the Book Page, and is the channel used by the Page > Page Sound property. Then there's three other channels you can use for other things. If you play an audio file in a specific channel it will stop any sound that is already playing in that channel - so if you want background music and your voice, you'll want to have these in separate channels.

Ariba Supply Chain collaboration includes Quality Inspection where Buyer can send Inspection request to supplier (Inspection Lot) on Ariba Network portal and subsequently supplier can send inspection results. Buyer can view inspection results submitted by supplier and make usage decision. 
Question: Instead of supplier submitting Inspection results, we want to record Inspection results in SAP and send it to supplier on Ariba Network portal. Can we send buyer recorded results to Supplier on Ariba Network. If yes then we need to send Inspection Request/Inspection lot to supplier on Ariba Network portal. How that process will work end to end.

Hi,
I have a unv Universe in which I would like to replace an existing Table with a new one. The original table schema changed. The table structure is still the same.
Can this be done without adding the new table and recreating the joins and dependencies from scratch?
Thanks.
Select the table, rename the table and enter the owner (your new schema).

Then examine the associated objects, which should look like this: "<owner>"."<table name>".<column name>

....
hope this is what you are looking for
I believe you need to replace manually and need to reset the joins again.There is a direct option in IDT for UNX but not very sure if same is available for unv universe in the designer.Below is the link you can refer to replace the table and steps to make sure.

Hi all,
I'm executing CF Push command in terminal to push app into BTP CF repository, but I'm getting this error when cf push command is executed.

I've run cf logs risk-management --recent and the error message says: 'Unable to require require package/file.json "passport". However, I'd already installed passport module by npm i passport. furthermore, the package-lock.json had been deleted and re-run npm install.
Could anyone provide me any assistance, please?
Best regards
Bruno Franzini

Just found out the resolution...
I've just run the following commands in the sequence:
Problem is solved.
Thank you 
Did you actually login or did your login token expire? try cf login again and then do the push one more time.
Hi Martin Stenzig , 
I'd executed cf login successfully just a few seconds before runnung cf push command. Neither cf login in terminal nor the menu shortcut View -> Find Command ... -> CF: Login to Cloud Foundry returned any error. Therefore, I've also tried cf push indiviually cf push risk-management-srv and cf push risk-management-db-deployer, but no success at all.
Did you limit the memory use of the service to 256M? That might be a little low for a nodejs CAP service. 
Have a look at the logs while you are pushing it. it looks like your apps are already created. 
Open another command line window and use `cf logs risk-management-srv`. Leave that open. Go back to your first window and try the push again. The log output should tell you why the push crashed. 
Again, I ran cf push in one terminal windows, while other was running cf logs risk-management-srv, again the only error is a message mentioning error to require package/file "passaport". Therefore, I've run npm install -g npm@8.7.0 and npm install passport. The issue remains existing.Regarding quote size, I increased it, but it doesn't seem to be a issue owing to ist used amount.


We have published sap/cds 5.9.4, which 'fixes' the issue by only emitting a warning in case of a missing xsuaa binding.  Also, it adds better error messages in case of missing dependencies like 'passport'. 
Hello There!
I have been connecting tables without problems. But, in the last one, when compiling the system returns the following message: "Foreign Key text, requires additional LANG field". I do not understand what the system needs.
Can anyone help me out? Thanks in advance!
A text table contains usually the client (if client specific), key of the main table, a language code, and the text in this language.
Hello everybody by an SQL command I created a crystal report report, I defined the parameter in the query but when importing report on SAP B1 it always asks to enter the parameter,
how can I create a crystal parameter linked with sap B1 without asking to parameterize it each time?
<br>
Hi,
Please delete the last line from the SQL code first. Then follow step 1 and add parameter as I showed. Click on the area inside the rectangle.

Then follow step 2 and save.
When working with commands in Crystal, you DO NOT want to use the Select Expert to filter your data as was suggested above. When you use the Select Expert to filter a command, Crystal will bring ALL of the data into memory and filter it there instead of pushing the filter to the database where it can be processed more efficiently.
 Instead, you want to use the where clause in the query like you were originally. I don't remember whether DocKey is a string or a number value, but if it's a string you need to surround the parameter in single quotes - WHERE T0."DocEntry" = '{?DocKey@}'. For more information about working with commands, including how to use parameters with commands, please see
https://blogs.sap.com/2015/04/01/best-practices-when-using-commands-with-crystal-reports/
-Dell
This should work either way, the problem is actually that you named the parameter incorrectly. The parameter should be named DocKey@ and binded to DocEntry, so your command should be:
Hai,

I am working on Visual Studio 2008 and Crystal Reports 2008 visual advantage for a project. I developed several reports and followed the steps of web site crystal reports project as per the Crystal Reports Walkthrough files. 
Now my problem is my solution would not compile and I see this error saying the "CrystalReportViewer1" object not in current context?..

I double checked all the required assemblies in the References, and the Webform where I have the CrystalReportViewer object and I have assigned an REportSource as one of the reports in my project.

I don't see any other errors, I checked the IIS / Default Websites for the setting the properties and localpath of the CrystalReportWebFromViewer2 ( I have that as my default in Default Websites). 
I am currently working on Visual Studio 2008, Visual Studio .NET 3.5 Framework and Crystal Reports 2008 and SQL server 2005 Express. 

Please help me resolve this error, Is there a way I can declare this CrystalReportViewer1 in my partial class file as:

Protected CrystalDecisions.ReportsSource.Engine.CrystalReportViewer CrystalREportViewer1 = new CrystalDecisions.ReportSource.Engine.CrystalReportViewer();

I tried entering this code snippet and compile (becuase other .NET and C# entities as declared as this) but the solution still did not compile.

Someone please help !..

Vijay.
Hi Vijaya,

Drag and drop CrystalReportViewer on your Form.
It seems that CrystalReportViewer is missing from the form.If you have already placed CrystalReportViewer on Form then check the name of viewer.


Hope this helps!!

Please check for namespace in the class file. It should not referred your project name. 
When I try to open certain workbooks for Analysis for Office with BW4HANA 2.0 data sources I get a strange error message which is attached.
The problem does not occur in our finance workbooks, but seems to appear for COPA data.
The problem seems particularly apparent for fields like 0RECORDTYPE in BW which we use the RSBUCKETS transaction in BW to group selections.
Every error message relates to the same offset problem for a string of length 11, specifically offset 0 and length 11. 
I have checked the logs and run ST05 and checked what fields would have this type of substring operation performed on them. RSRT seems to complain about the RecordType field, but I have been unable to find the precise cause.
The suspicion is that it is related to the buckets.
The issue does not appear for SAC.
I believe the user is using the latest 2.8 version.
afo-error.jpg
Hi Mitchell,
The error seems indeed more related to the backend rather than a bug in Analysis Office.I would suggest to record a backend trace according to SAP KBA 3216926. Then execute the trace ID (e.g. SID/123456) in RSTT transaction, to find more details about the errors and search for possible solutions in SAP Support Portal:>> https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/knowledge-base.html

Hi, we are using S4 2020. We have an outbound scenario with EWM and TM and we are using ASR for direct integration (Without TU). There is a field at delivery header where the stop sequence is supposed to be updated. We need this field in order to sort the delivery preparation. We are not understanding how to get this value updated from TM. Just a comment, this is not related to a loading plan. We need to know what needs to be done in TM side to get the stop sequence updated and how this sequence can be transferred to EWM.

Hi,

I want Product hierarchy Description in my report with Number of the level in the product hierarchy like..

00001...............................1..........................Tools
0000100001......................2..........................Electrical parts
000010000100000001 ........3...........................Screwdrivers

with all three levels....

I m picking PRODH (Product hierarchy) from s501 table with other records...with the ref. of PRODH, i want Product hierarchy Description, with all 3 levels....

When i join both tables (s501 & V_T179), it gives syntax error that it is not abap dictionary table as a table, projection view or database view...

then how can i pick Product hierarchy Description with 3 levels..

Please let me know...

Thanks..
Use the FM RV_PRODUKTHIERARCHIE_PRED_GET

Pass the required language in SPRAS and pass the Product hierarchy in the field NODE

Abhishek Jolly
Hi,

May be you can get the product hierarchy description from T179T table .

Phani,
Hi

You need to move the PRODH/PRDHA value to another ITAB.

Delete adjacent duplicates from the same.

then loop ITAB split them into 3 levels

WA1-PRODH = WA1-PRODH+0(5).
append WA1 to ITAB1.
WA1-PRODH = WA1-PRODH+0(10).
append WA1 to ITAB1.
WA1-PRODH = WA1-PRODH.
append WA1 to ITAB1.

Hi,
I need to pull the data of total number of line items in a particular Quote / SO
is there any way like using VBAK or something.
Thanks,
Tito
Hi,
Pass your SO as VBELN to VBAP table and you can see the details of the line items.

Currently when I remove plant in analysis for office, the data gets aggregated at BU level.But the derivation of WE(WGP/ATT) is not as expected.
As the Plant C has 0 ATT value so the respective WGP value(200) should not be considered to derive WE at BU level.
As shown in 3rd table plant C values should be excluded and aggregated at BU level.
Hi Vishwanath
The result is actually as expected. Or that is it's not expect that 200/0 is 0! Do you have a special rule for division by zero?
If you don't want the rows with zero ATT to count then you need to filter them away. The problem is that your calculation rule for with and without drill on plant is not the same.

We are investigating options for blind recruiting. The purpose is to remove any unconscious bias from our selection.
We are able to limit the view in Success Factors so that the hiring leader cannot see name, email and gender in the job req however we are wondering how other companies approach hiding details like he/she, name, email, linkedin profile address from attached documents especially with CV's from agencies being written in a 3rd party perspective.
Hi Alison, sorry this isn't an answer but rather a question of how did you get on with your investigation. I to believe in the business i work for we need to cut out all unconscious bias from recruiting. So far the hiring manager can see name, email and CV's and i want this to not be visible. 
How did you limit the view in Success Factors so they couldn't see the data but still able to review applications? 
Thank you
Hello Tom
You are the first person who has responded to this question since posting. I have not successfully been able to find an answer to this issue as yet so am keeping my ears open for anything that comes up.
Hello Alison - have you heard about the SAP tool called Brilliant Hire? Sounds like it would be exactly what you are looking for! https://www.brillianthire.io/
Hello,
I realize this is an older thread but as the DEI world is rapidly evolving in todays market, was curious if anyone knows of a bolt on tool for SuccessFactors that may be able to help with the blind recruiting process? Honestly, surprised SAP/SF still hasnt implemented this as this seems like a hot topic, even more so today than years past.
Thank you,

Hi experts,
recently we tried to establish a connection to a websocket which runs on our On-Premise S/4 HANA System from BAS. We have a corresponding Cloud Connector up and running and also the settings within the destination are prepared to allow the websocket connection (all paths to the corresponding apc are available and also reachable through the Cloud Connector). Anyway... when we try to build up the connection we always receive an error without any message at all. We also tried via transaction SAPC_CROSS_ORIGIN to allow the request from the BAS origin without any success... Does anybody of you have a clue what the problem could be?
Looking forward to your answers!

Hello All,
I have a requirement to build adobe form which contains 2 dynamic tables on same page and if data overflow happens then it should be moved to new page and same position. Therefore I created 2new content area for each table and after overflow I mentioned their respective content area.
Issue: If data if getting overflowed in first table its directly goes to next page content area and update the record and only after that proceeds to update the second table i.e. on 2nd page
Can anyone guide me here, I tried multiple ways but nothing is working.
There are few things which aren't working in this project.


I have an external destination where my odata services are hosted https://mtalertprovider.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/odata/v2/AlertService/$metadata. I have included this as resource in mta.yaml file. This destination is utilized in xs-app.json of "App" module. I have created an dataSource in manifest.json. Then the entity from oData called "Alert" is utilized in view.xml. But this not working. Is this the correct way of accessing an oData??

My both apps are throwing same error.App could not be opened because the SAP UI5 component of the application could not be loaded.Failed to load UI5 component for navigation intent "#object1-action1"
After so many attempts the project gets deployed from webide. The deployment often fails.
Is there any way to test the FLP locally in webide?

Please help me with my above queries. This is actually effecting my sprint deliverables.
I have attached a screenshot of the issue 

Hi Meghana,
I've the same problem.
Could you already solve it. My application was running some days without any error and now I receive the same error message.
Thanks for your help and kind regards
Sabine
If you are trying to add extended version of a standard app make sure to activate SICF Nodes for both standard and extended app. This worked for me.
For better understanding, you can refer to SAP Note : 2808615

Hi Meghana,
I got the same problem, let us know how did you solved it.
Any solution for this?
I found the solution for this problem, it is in the webide
when I create a new project, it creates the id as following "ztest_project.ztest_project" instead of "ztest_project"
and the path for the controllers are "ztest_project/ztest_project" instead of "ztest_project"
I just replaced all the duplications with "ztest_project" in all of the files of the project and deployed again.
This resolved my problem
I also faced same problem . I solved this problem by maintaining routing.
i maintained routing like below for my app containing only one view(view1). i forgot to maintain this before.
"rootView": { 
"viewName": "zsale.view.View1",
"type": "XML" }, 
"routing":{ 
"config":{ 
"routerClass":"sap.m.routing.Router", 
"viewType":"XML", 
"viewPath":"zsale.view" },
"routes":[] }
Thanks ,

Resolution:1. Make sure you have opened the/sap/bc/ui2/app_index/path and all its subpaths in your Cloud Connector for your On-Premise system, if you're using Cloud Connector2. Make sure the app_indexservice in your On-Premise system is activated and defined to use BASIC authentication (not SAML)3. Re-generate the extension project and try to run it Check below KBA2853507 - App could not be opened because the SAP UI5 component of the application could not be loaded.(Failed to load UI5 component for navigation intent #title-display)
I have also faced the same issue while creating ALP app and found out that it is caused because of application name missmatch in Webide and Backend BSP app. 
I have created the new ALP app with the name PROJECT in Webide workspace and while deploying i have given application name as ZPROJECT. when i run the application, it was searching for ZPROJECT namespace and was not able to load.
Solved it by maintaining the same name while creating the App in Webide and while deploying it to the Backend for the first time.
Hi,
Most of the time this issue occurs when the project service is not active. go to SICF tcode , enter your Service Same and make sure the service is active.
can you also get more information about the intent error in Tcode : /UI2/FLIA .

I want to put a company logo on the login page of my app as well as website. I'm unable to display a image by using the image url. May I know the steps to upload an image or a company logo on Formcell page or section page?
For the upper right corner of the pages you can add an action button to the pages with the appropriately sized logo and decide what should happen if clicked.  For the Welcome page you can replace the SAP logo with your own logo but you only have limited sizing capabilities.  See the documentation  for more details.
For the actual login page where the user enters their credentials, that page is provided by the Identity Provider and not part of the MDK application.  If you are using the SAP default provider I don't think you can customize it but you could investigate getting an IAS client where you may be able to customize the page further.  I am not too familiar with the IAS setup / capabilities so you will need to investigate that further.
Hello,
currently we have built the SAP Asset Manager 2110 iOS-App for distribution in the customer AppStore.
For distribution the app has been uploaded on Apple side, that it could be afterwards brought to the user devices.
But: The Apple DEV-Team now needs for the release access to the application because it always starts with the onBoarding process.
It's not that easy to handover fully access (DEV, INT, PRD) because behind the authentication there is for example MS Azzure, SAP-authorization, SAP-User,... --> can anybody help us, how to solve this step?
We have three Apps for release - one for each system - DEV (development), INT (integration), PRD (Production).
Currently we tried to activate in our app the demo mode, but there the "DEST_SAM2110_PPROP.rq.udb" could not be loaded.
Regards
Björn
To add demo files to a client
Once your .mdkproject is setup for demo mode create a new client from it and when you get to the Welcome screen you should see the Try the demo link.
For the generic MDK client we provide the demo mode so Apple can review and validate our release.  What version of MDK are you using for your client? 
In terms of errors opening the db files, please make sure you created the db files using a client where SecureDatabaseEncryptionKey was set to false.  This is required for the demo db files. I would also recommend including the demo.js along with the database files in the demo folder of your .mdkproject to ensure the metadata used for the demo matches the db files.  This also allow you to customize the demo metadata to be different from the branded metadata.
For your development and integration clients I would probably recommend you not distribute them via the app store since your audience is very limited for those and look to provide that internally.  This allows for that app to change more frequently during development and testing and also support overrides so you can switch environments easily or have multiple versions available internally.
Your production app can then be distributed via the app store and either allow overrides like the SSAM app or be pre-configured for your production environment.

Hello,

transaction SU01, tab roles: no role assigned, only a reference user is assigned to the user <test-user>.
In this case "Menu - user menu" is disabled (it is grey in the session manager after login). The user <test-user> can not switch to the user menu, he has only the sap menu. 

Is there a way to inherit the user menu from the reference user?

Thanks for any assistance,
Andy.
Hi Andy, 

It will be possible but not in the way you want. You can create user menu in SE43 and then assign that to the target user. But I think you already know about this option and don't want to use it 😔

Regards.
Ruchit Khushu
The reference user concept was designed only for the inheritence of authorizations (i.e. a user which is assigned to a reference user inherits all authorizations which are assigned to that reference user; such assignment can be done using roles and/or profiles).

Indeed, roles are not only containers for authorizations but also for menu items.
Well, I'm not sure whether it was not intended to inherit also other attributes (except authorizations) or whether that's a missing feature. Technically it would be possible to determine whether the current user is assigned to a reference user when displaying the "SAP Easy Access Menu".

Cheers, Wolfgang
Hello all,

many thanks for your views and opinions.

I will wait a few days for possible solutions but i think, this functionality ist not implemented. It would be a good and, in my opinion, also a logical feature to roll out the menu and not only the rights of the reference user.

 Thanks for the discussion,
Andy.

Hello Everyone,
before i will test a new RPA Bot, e.g. the Mass Upload of Timesheet Entries (4JJ) in the Q system i would like to do it first in the test tenant/sandbox system. 
Is it possible to do so with no need for creating communication user/agreements/ scenarios and the 3 CDS views, mentioned in the test script, before? Since they are already pre created in the test tenant? 
Is it correct that before i can test the 4JJ i need to have an account for the BTP in order to download the Bot in the cloud factory for testing purposes?
Maybe somebody can help me.
Thank you and Best Regards,
Charlotte
Hello,
You will need access to SAP Intelligent RPA Cloud Factory access to download the bot content. As you already have access to test script, you can follow the instructions for S/4HANA and BTP Side configurations to get the bot running. 
The BTP Configurations point to necessary S4 system you are access. it can be test / sandbox system
Hello Raghuraman,
thank you for your response. I will check my Access to the cloud factory.
Since i have not found the mandatory CDS Views in the test tenant (mentioned in the test script), it seems they have to be created before testing is possible.
Best Regards,
Charlotte
Hello Charlotte. I have included additional information which will help you get this Automation Bot set up and execute the Time sheet automation process. 
SAP Build Process Automation is available as a service on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP), allowing you to productively adapt, improve, and innovate your business processes. 
1. Please follow the steps to complete the initial set up on BTP (Document link https://help.sap.com/docs/PROCESS_AUTOMATION/a331c4ef0a9d48a89c779fd449c022e7/b9758013e1114c9194cd52de2885e9a9.html?version=Cloud )
You can follow the steps below which will ensure you to check if the pre-requisite configuration is completed.
1. Register an SAP S/4HANA Cloud System in a Global Account in SAP BTP
https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/28171b629f3549af8c1d66d7c8de5e18.html
2. BTP configuration to start using SAP Build Process Automation.
https://help.sap.com/docs/PROCESS_AUTOMATION/a331c4ef0a9d48a89c779fd449c022e7/089a5d6f47b344e8b370460098980b9b.html?version=Cloud
After the Initial Set up for SAP BTP and Process Automation Tool is ready. You can start the pre-requisite for the bot which is creation of CDS Views. It is needed to have these 3 CDS views to be created in your system.
Reason to create CDS Views as Pre-requisite : SAP Build Process Automation Bot verifies the staffing details and then for the update or delete operation of time records, the bot also checks if the Time Sheet Record exists and contract type (custom CDS view), and if the time entry has already been billed to the customer (via Custom CDS API). After cycling through entries in input file(s), the bot creates and updates time entries via API “Manage Workforce Timesheet
3. Mass Upload of Timesheet Entries (4JJ) https://store.irpa.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/#/package/7718394a-e204-4c87-99ff-ea998969971d

CDS view I_WorkforcePerson as an OData service . This is to link workforce person details
CDS views This one to verify if billing to customer is already done. I_RRBCostDynamicItem, I_CustProjSlsOrdItmBillgPlnItm and I_AccountingDocument as an OData service in the system by considering I_RRBCostDynamicItem as Primary Data Source and I_CustProjSlsOrdItmBillgPlnItm & I_AccountingDocument as Associated Data Source. 
Hope this helps you, In case you need more assistance. You can raise ticket under component CA-ML-RPA-S/4 and You can as well reach out to me in case more help needed to run the bot in the system
I have converted the existing universe (.unv) to unx.
We now have another datasource that we want to utilise in an existing universe. need to add more data source with existing one. 
Can someone help me? 
You cannot convert a single source UNX universe into a multi source UNX universe. The only option is to recreate the universe.
Please be aware that multi source universes are not supported in the new BI version anymore (code name BI 2024). Therefore I would recommend using a different approach (and create "multi-source view" in a database for example).
Not to mention that performance of multi source universe (which will use data federator, so you have to size it correctly) are terrible. 
Hi Team,
While deleting records from UI build through the RAP model unmanaged, I am getting the below pop-up, How do I change variable {0} to the correct key? This pop-up is coming before even it hits DELETE method of its local class implementation. Pls suggest 

Hi Ankesh,
These are transition messages which is coming as pop up and based on the user confirmation the relevant local behavior handler implementation would be called.( in your case it is delete implementation)
Looks like it is OData V4 service. 
Try defining the semantic keys in the RAP CDS.

Hello,
Is there a transaction for obtaining the available (net) stock for all SKUs, which is already reduced of the quantities in scheduled for delivery/on order stock etc. ?
I'm using the Stock Overview Report because I can extract the stock of all SKUs.
I know that the unrestricted-use stock includes also the quantites scheduled for delivery/on order stock etc. 
I can see these quantities splitted in column in the transaction MMBE, but I can't extract massively all the SKUs with this transaction.
Many thanks in advance,
Hello Andrea Arbizzani,
For Single material you can check CO09 (net) Stock. For massive extraction, it's suggested to develop a customized report.
For massive extract of all SKU's without (net) stock, you can use MB52. Run the transaction with option "Flat list" and extract your data.

Hi Team,
I am trying to frame the URI in rest api programming where i have conditions as below.
1. release - id = 10011
2. phase - id NE '5n89o5n6zqy3ds3d3y6z3ol03'
Im framing in program as below but it does not accept the second condition.
/api/shared_spaces/1234/workspaces/45678/features?fields=id,name,transport_nrs_udf,phase,release&query="release EQ { id EQ 10011 } ; (!(phase EQ { id EQ 5n89o5n6zqy3ds3d3y6z3ol03 } )"
Request to guide me on the same and proper URI so that i can use the same.
If im using only the first condition in rest api program...it works but not the second one.

Hi There
Hoping I can get some votes for a customer Influence suggestion for SAP to create a audit report showing who reports have been shared with.

We need to disaggregate our demand plan based on our customer source ratio. Currently the disaggregation takes our forecast and disaggreagates it accross all of our locations that have been setup for that cusotmer. We DONT want that to happen. We presently maintain a customer ratio in the CustomerSource master data where we place a "1" against the location where we want ALL the demand to be sourced from for that customer. So when the forecast is entered at the product customer level ALL the fcst amount should be disagged against the one location....however....it disaggs over several locations. How can I set it up to do what we want?????
Thank you.
Zoran
I think thier is some confusion. Let me address it step by step
1) if harcoded value of 99 works, so will the KF value. But check the following
2) You are using attribute "MAXCUSTOMERQUOTA" and in my example i used ''CRATIO''. this are different attributes.
3)  mark the KF as both stored & Calculated. Presently it shows that the KF is stored.
4) Use the below  Dissagg expression and let me know if that works.
IF("MAXCUSTOMERQUOTA"=1,"SALESFORECASTQTY",NULL)
If this doesnt work then only options is to do some screen sharing session and see where exaclty it is missing.
Regards
Ayan
Hello Zoran
The best way to acheive this is by using dissaggregation expression in the traget KF where the forecast is getting dissaggregated and saved. Please use the below approach and it will work.
Assuming that the target KF is stored, use the below steps

select the above highlighted option for your target KF. That will open a expression section in the calculation area and you need to use the below expression thier

This is the expression window and use the follwing expression. please keep in mind not to mention any planning level in dissagg expression
IF(''CRATIO''=1,"SOURCEKF",NULL)
Regards
Ayan
Thank you for the suggestion. I tried it and it did not work....I got this error

Here is the setup

Thanks again for helping...BTW I entered the data at the product Customer level in excel.
That's odd my copy and paste of the screen shots did not work
here is the attachment with screen shots

hope this worked
Here is the screen shot of the error
I logged out and back in....then the error went away. BUT it is still disaggreagating over ALL the locations not just the one that is sole sourced. SO the expression you suggested is not working.
Thanks
Zoran
Well I chnaged the expression to this
IF("MAXCUSTOMERQUOTA"=1,99,NULL)

And no it is working....very strange....if I change 99 to 0 then it does not work and it disaggs equally across all locations.....dont know why 99 or any number > 0 works....the mysteries of IBP
Ok so are you saying that if I chnage the sales forecast qty KF to stored AND Calculated it should work? I will try that and return to the KF in the disagg expression form the "99" i currently have.
Here is the screen shot of the setup

Hi,
is it possible to load a file with UploadSetItem without an UploadSet. To load a file?
I declare in UploadSetItem in JS:
const oUploadItem = new UploadSetItem({ url: "url", fileName: demo.jpg });oUploadItem.download(true); 
When I run this now, nothing happens. No error message, no activity in the network tab. Is it not intended to use the control like this?
Dear experts,
In December (a few days before Christmas -> means many recipients probably had activated their Out-Of-Office-Notifications) we published a Mail campaign with a target group of appr. 3.000 contacts (sent via SINCH from SAP Marketing Cloud).
 Except of a few soft and hard bounces, we are sure, that most of the 3.000 contacts received our mail successfully.  But we are wondering, that we only got back 2 Out-Of-Office-Mails, which does not make sense regarding a target group of 3.000 contacts. In a test campaign we sent mails to a small internal group of contacts. A few of them had activated their Out-Of-Office-Mail. Every contact received our mail successfully, but the Out-Of-Office-Mails were not sent to the Reply-to-address saved for our campaign.  Why do we not get all Out-Of-Office-Mails back from our recipients? Is it possible that the mail providers like Outlook are blocking these mails?  As additional information: Because we have not finished implementing the SAP Marketing Cloud for our customer, the customer currently is still using Inxmail to execute mail campaigns. In these Inxmail Mail campaigns the same Reply-to-address is used and our customer receives all Out-Of-Office-Mails.

Dear All,
with the help of abaper we have coded a customized error msg when user create PO with delivery date lesser than the PO document date. We took technical help because user may create PO with past date that time system should check PO document date not the system date.
Now when i create PO through ME21N by manually entering all the details that time system throws error msg. But when i create PO by copying the existing PO ( Purchasing document field in PO item data) that time system is not validating the delivery date and it allows to save the PO.
Can anyone please tell me the reason ?
Hello https://people.sap.com/janusap,
Please connect with your ABAP team to fix the issue.
Regards,
Neeraj Jain 
Why did you create a custom message for this? There is a message which already exists 
"ME039/ Delivery Date is in the past" 
Did you try just changing that message in Materials Management -> Purchasing -> Environment Data -> Define Attributes of System Messages ?

I have 21 of an item in unrestricted stock for that plant. There are outstanding customer orders against that stock for 4 units, and I have entered two different STO PO's for 2 each totaling 4 more tied up units. Why is my unrestricted stock still showing 21? I would think it would at least show 17 for the two orders for transfer that i personally put in. Will unrestricted stock always show the total number of units on hand until my customer orders and STO's leave "Ordered" stage? 
Hello https://people.sap.com/pdyke,
Stock will reduce only when you do PGI. Before PGI your stock will be shown 21 if you make orders/STO for 21 quantities.
Let me know if any questions on it.

Hello hello good morning! I wanted to make a query in a customer we want to upgrade the product Enable Now. Since we have an important jump of versions from the current one to the last SEN release (9 releases) is that we need help again to verify how the upgrade can be done.

Is it possible to upgrade from release 1902HF1 to 2211HF1 directly?
Or do you have to upgrade in between, for example from 1902HF1 to an intermediate version and then to 2211HF1?

I copy ximena.becerra@sap.com who referred us to make this consultation by this means.
Regards!
Hi  Franco Videla, 
Yes, you can upgrade your 1902HF1 release to the latest 2211HF1 without any issues. You should also consider upgrading Apache Tomcat to the latest supported version, as older versions have security vulnerabilities reported.
Check this SAP Note 3300101 about the latest supported Apache Tomcat version. Spoiler: it's 9.0.71 ;)
HI all, I have a simple but interesting case:

  DATA: lv_name TYPE string VALUE 'this;is;a;test'.

  REPLACE ALL OCCURRENCES OF ';' IN lv_name WITH space.
  WRITE lv_name.

The strange thing is, this report's output is "thisisatest", but not "this is a test", as thought.
What is the problem here?

Kind regards, Matthias
HI,

Try this out,


 DATA: lv_name(60) TYPE C..
VALUE 'this;is;a;test'.

lv_name = 'this;is;a;test'.

 WHILE lv_name CS ';'.

 lv_name+SY-FDPOS(1) = SPACE.

ENDWHILE.

  WRITE lv_name.

Hope it helps you,

Regards,
Abhijit G. Borkar
Hi,

OK TRANSLATE is the smartest solution, but


works as well - note the special string delimiter ` not '.

Regards,

Clemens
Hi Matthias,

I think this is explained in the ABAP help, but not very clearly.

It says, "In the case of character string processing, the closing spaces are taken into account for data objects dobj of fixed length; they are not taken into account in the case of new."  Where dobj is ';' and new is space.

So, what it seems to be saying is, if there's a trailing space in the replaced string (';') it is considered.  But if there is a trailing space in the replacing string (here space) it is removed.  As your replacing string is entirely space, it removes it all.

I tried using '. .' (dot, space,dot) as the replacing string, and the space is retained, but if I use '. ' (dot, space) the space is removed.

I guess a potential work around is to do this is two steps, replace ';' with ' .', then replace '.' with space.

Regards,
Nick
Try 

replace ',' with space into lv_name.

WRITE: / lv_name.
hi don't have a idea why ur code is not working but this one is working 

 

Hope That Helps

Vertical bar forces ABAP to respect space. ;) Works 100%. 
Use vertical bars in your code always when you want to respect the spaces. 
Regards,
Nemanja
Hi Matthias,

I have faced same issue when i was working on a report. You can't use 'replace all' to insert spaces in a string. 

You can achieve it using 2 ways:
 
Split your string at ';' and save it in different variables. And concatenate these variables in a string separated by space. So that you will be able to display your string as 'this is a test'.

Or you can use 'translate' to replace ';' with space. I am not sure whether this option will work. You can just try it out.

Thanks,

Hello, 
In my model I have 2 dimensions: Employee (which has the property Employee Company) and Intercompany.
I would like to copy the property dimension (Employee Company) members to the Intercompany ID.
Do you know how I can do in SAP Analytics Cloud? 
Thank you.

Do you want to copy the attribute of one dimension as master data Id's of another dimension? Employee company attribute values as master data in inter company dimension I don't think its possible to load from one SAC dimension to another.
Nikhil
Hello Nikhil Anand ,
as a matter of fact, as a starting point I have this row in my SAC data model (the dimension Employee has the property Employee Company): 

where # means no value and company/employee/department have value. 
Then, I would like to create a data action which, as a result, gives the following output:

by copying the property Employee.EmployeeCompany into the Intercompany dimension. 
Is it possible to create a data action which gives the sub-mentioned result? Otherwise, do you have any other solution?
Thanks in advance.

Hello everyone,
We are currently developing a CAP project that acts as an handler of ODATA calls for our Fiori applications, exposing various entities from our SAP backend, that is exposed on BTP through Cloud Connector.
The Business Application Studio instance is deployed on subaccount A, while the CAP itself is to be deployed on subaccount B.
We're facing this issue: via BAS Run configuration it is impossible to test any kind of OData call as every call results in a 403 Forbidden, without additional infos. We initially thought this to be a XCSRF Token issue, so we included the token in the request in the test.http file and also included the boolean values "csrf" and "csrfinbatch" in the package.json.
We also made an .env file bound to the correct service instances (and included it in the run configuration), and we also created a default-env.json containing all the necessary data taken from the deployed CAP project.
None of this has worked and we're still finding it impossible to test any kind of network call unless we deploy the CAP project.

Did you try to test it via POSTMAN or ADVANCE REST CLIENT?
Link to test OData API: YouTube
how is the authentication configured for both subaccounts? I can imagine that the jwt token of one account is not valid for the other. At least both need to be configured with the same idp and I think a trust between the two subaccounts is needed.
Have you tried with basic auth instead of xsuaa in your cap backend?

Hello Leonardo,
we had the same Problem a while ago and were able to solve it.
The Problem in our case was that the service key of the service Instance was blank and therefore could not be used to create the Destination automatically. We resolved it by creating a new Service Instance and making sure that the service key of the Instance is not blank.
We are not exactly sure if this will help because you said that you already tried deleting and creating the instance.
Best Regards,
Jan
Hi Leonardo, 
I had the same problem in my trial account but you can create the destination looking the service instance key. 


You only need copy these properties in anditional properties in the destination and client id and client secret.

HI
This is regd the bonus calculations for getting EC basis wherein we have three options to chose which are Employee History from EC, Fixed Effective in EC(Point in time calculations) and Custom formula.
Point in time calculations provides to select effective date for salary/target %. We can also get earnings from earning data table. Since Everywhere it talks about annualized salary. and we want to fetch basic monthly sal as on 31/12 against target salary column in employee history data file. 
So I chose below options to explore :-
1) Eligible salary/earning considered as annualized earnings for the programme:as NO
2) Tried to upload eligible earnings in monthly frequency
but amount coming in target salary column is throwing strange amounts under EHD file
3) I tried using below option, but it comes with annualized target amount which is not our requirement, Since pay component gives annualized salary.

We thought to create pay component group to store monthly basic value, but it won’t fetch value as on 31/12 in case of any salary changes.
Kindly share your thoughts as to how to proceed ahead with this requirement. 
 

Also, If fixed date is selected as 31/12/2022 and if employee are having two compensation records one from 01/01/2016 till 31/03/20203 and second one from 01/04/2023 to 31/12/2023 then why two records are appearing with different salary since we have given fixed date as 31/12. only one record should appear since they have same target percent with different basics. Kindly confirm my understanding if its correct as KBA 2806142.

Employee History data Record for EE


Pl guide . Thanks for all help
Thanks
Ritanshi
 
Hi Ritanshi Bansal 
I just checked with my colleagues and Point in Time only works with Pay Component Groups, the assumption of this feature is that is based on annualized amounts. The only solution for you would be to use the Earnings Data Table which would require client to upload data.
Regarding your other question about the 2 records it is expected behavior since the Salary changed as per the screenshot. If you want more information about how to control the number of records please watch recording #2 from this blog : https://blogs.sap.com/2021/03/11/3-key-configuration-setups-to-master-in-variable-pay/
All the best
Xavier
 Thanks Xavier Le Garrec 
Thanks for checking
1) My issue is earning tables is not working as expected. It is not the same which we have upload and some strange and complex amounts comes in employee history data file. So do we have any KBA to refer except 2806142,
2) I have already seen your merge record blog. and this issue is not related to multiple record.as per standard behavior of this functionality point in time. If i have provided date to be fetched as 31/12/2022 then in 2023 salary column should be updated with 31/12/2022 amounts .it should not take values beyond 31/12. This is what is mentioned in KBA 2806142. If you will see an employee with records 
1) 01/01/2026 till 31/03/2023 with salary 4583.333
2) 01/04/2023 till 31/12/2023 with salary 6000
effective date selected for salary/earning as 31/12/2022 then both records should have same salary amount which is 4583.333 . 
Which is not happening. is my understanding correct , please confirm
Thanks

Hi All,
I wanted to build a SAP UI5 app similar to what an Enterprise search functionality shows for Material Search as shown in attached screenshot.
enterprise-search-on-fiori-launch-pad.jpg
is there any way that we can extend Standard app of this Material Search functionality of what Enterprise Search is offering? what is the Standard app to look into for extensibility concept or can we reuse this component ?
Also I need to enhance filters available on enterprise Search .How can I achieve this? can we create a custom app using ESH_SEARCH_SRV OData in our app? If so how to pass the Datasource as xyz~Material~H connector to Odata service (for ex. xyz is the system ID). I noticed this in standard OData call being made via search connectors and F2189 and F3042 apps are only loading in troubleshooting but there is no proper documentation on how to use/enhance these reusable components in Fiori Library. I also tried configuring standard App F3036 Manage Search Models however it’s only showing a blank screen. Could any one used Enterprise Search in Custom Ui5 app if so please let us know how to achieve this in detail please?
Thanks in advance.
Kind Regards
sita
You can extend the search connectors using transaction esh_cockpit and esh_modeler
Hello experts,
We followed the tutorial below to expose S/4 applications to Work Zone (standard).
The goal is to use Work Zone for uses to access the S/4 applications.
https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-launchpad-federation-expose-content.html#4f33de9e-c0c4-4dc4-9762-ab80febd6df0
After we "update" the new Content Provider, the Web Dynpro applications are displayed on Work Zone, but when user clicks the application, it returns error 404 (Not Found).
Is there a way to make the Web Dynpro application accessible this way (through Content Provider)?
THank you
Can you check the error logs and network trace in the development tools of the browser?
This should work find but maybe the path is blocked in the cloud connector.

Has anybody designed the Table function based on AMDP to do perform the cross-dimension unit conversion. We have designed a Table function based on AMDP but it is doing conversion only when the output unit i.e M3 in our case (Parameter based) is present in MARM table. Below we can see that the M3 is not maintained in MARM table.

The standard FM - MD_CONVERT_MATERIAL_UNIT gives the correct result if we give any input unit from the available Dimensions in T006 (Volume, Length and ZM3N, AAAADL) for the material 1228.


I have attached the document which includes the code and final output. Our objective is to get the input parameter unit (M3) in the itab8 - BUOM column so that the conversion can be performed if we put a joining condition based on 
Material, Input Parameter and BUOM as shown below-

Hi,
I have a requirement to remove leading numbers in a string in CDS View. LTRIM could be the ideal solution if i have to remove a single character, but in my case i have to remove a set of characters(numbers) at the beginning of a string. 
For EX: 
In the string '123Material456' I have to remove the leading 123 and the result should be 'Material456'.
Any idea on how to achieve this in a string in CDS View? I tried searching in the forum but could not get an ideal solution.
Any help is much appreciated.
Regards,
Ravi.
Hi Ravi,
If this highlighted function works like a regular expression to find any matches or like CA in ABAP, then you should be able to use it in conjunction with substring as the pos argument to meet your requirement.

Regards,
Ryan Crosby
Hi Ravi,
Please try to use replace regular expression.

Hello Andre Fischer,
I have read about the new RAP naming conventions (I_, R_, C_) and I was wondering, whether it is supported by the official RAP generator integrated in Eclipse ADT.This is because the RAP generator in ADT creates only 1 CDS interface view and 1 CDS consumption view based on a database table. However, according to the new RAP naming conventions and to the new VDM, I should create at least 3 CDS Views (interface = I_*, base = R_*, projection = C_*).On the other hand, if I read the documentation to the RAP generator, it suggests to use the prefixes I_ and C_.I thought, that the idea behind the new VDM is, that I can create one generic interface view (I_*) that is the basis for both RAP- (R_*/C_*) and analytical apps (I_*Cube/C_*Query).If I understand it right, the RAP generator doesn't support at the moment the creation of an application independent interface view.According best practice, am I supposed to use the generator and develop apps in a rapid way by loosing the flexibility of an independent reuse layer? In this case, do I risk developing applications that are hard to maintain in the future releases.Or should I start developing applications according to the new VDM and wait until the official RAP generator supports the new architecture? Or is the best way using the open source generator to be able developing best practice RAP apps rapidly?Can you please give some advice regarding this matter in order to find the best way developing RESTful applications and using the right naming conventions?

The company I work for uses HP SANs for our production environment. They are expensive but they work well it seems (not my job to manage). We also have some Synology UC3200 systems at some remote sites that suit our needs but they cannot expand to what we need for bulk backups.
We are looking for more cost effective bulk storage for backups as the HP gear is not really priced appropriately for this use. We currently have Fiber Channel tape backups as well as some spinning rust in QNAP etc. Our use case for bulk storage is for backups only. We use Veeam currently. We need compatibility with SAP and SQL backups.
Questions that I have is:
Is ZFS compatible with SQL and SAP (SAP points us towards BTRFS)
Would a SAP community system meet these needs?
Initial repository expected to be ~1PB
Needs to have fault tolerance
Should be expandable for future use
Prefer the ability synchronize with an off site repository (we have a sister site with a 2Gbps 60GHz link between us and them - initial sync would be done locally...)
I am a hobby SAP community guy. This is not my area of expertise. From the first glance at the M-Series gear, and my rudimentary knowledge of SAP community Core, it seems to be a possible solution. My first thought would be to share the bulk storage to Veeam over 10GE or 40E and just use SAP community for the bulk storage. Then, use ZFS replication to copy differentials to the remote site on a schedule. (Would be nice to have both sites replicate their data to each other - it is different data completely at both sites). There are probably better ways to do this, but this is why I am asking.
So, if there are any peeps on this forum that have M-Series devices in production, or other like type SAP community systems, please let me know your thoughts. We are at the very beginning of the journey and I would like to have some options to spur conversation.
Thank you!

Hello Experts,
My question is, what is the best way to display two date ranges on a single report? 
For example, I want a most recent 7-day rolling view ever-present at the top of my sheet, and then I also want a hierarchy so I can view things like YTD or QTD for past data.

Essentially, I would want it to look like this, just with the most recent 7 days at the top of the sheet, instead of last year's data.
However, if I try to bring in a second posting date, I am met with some resistance. Filtering on one posting date affects the other. What I have tried so far is either 1) duplicating the data in the model and assigning the 2nd iteration as a timestamp or 2) blending the model and utilizing one posting date from the blended model and the other from the original.
This is the result of filtering on the timestamp version of the posting date or using a blended model. Both Posting Date_2 (timestamp) and Posting Date are capped by the more recent date value.

Definitely appears to be some user error here, just trying to figure out how much! Once again, thanks for the time and assistance.
I am currently trying to figure out a way to gather data on the amount of time it takes the GR to get to the warehouse. If anyone has any idea what the best solution to this, please let me know. Thank you!

Hoping someone knows if there is any type of integration to be able to use currency conversion in a restaurant accounting back office solution. If not does anyone have any ideas on work arounds to capture this information using SAP software.

Hi,

How can we create a variant in VA05 to make it available in the display variant list?do we need any authorization?

Thanks,
Rakesh.
Hi,

Please try this in your user parameters:

A)  Menu -> 'System -> User profile -> Own data'
B)  Change to the 'Parameters' screen
C)  Maintain the following entry,
Parameter: SD_VARIANT_MAINTAIN Value: A
D)  Save your new settings.

This will allow you to create and maintain variants in VA05.

Hi!

Unfortunately VA05 is not very customer-friend transaction. You can't save variants, only LAYOUT-variants.

You have to type in the selection over and over again.

Hi All,
Could you please help me on providing only view access to the story created by me to other users without giving BI admin role?
Note:
Earlier users were able to access the story with the role: Display user, but after SAC update on 29th Jan, users are not able to access same story.
Thanks in advance! 
Regards,
Dinesh B M
For non-admin users, you need to provide both a role that has at minimum view rights on stories, AND share the story or folder containing the story itself with view rights.
By default, any story that is in the public folder should be viewable by a user with a role that has view rights, but this default can be changed by an Admin user.

Peter

Within SAC Analytics Application is there a way to consume a model via script without needing to include it a widget? Similar to how in design studio you would add the data sources to consume them.
I'm trying to populate a dropdown widget with content via script from a data source.
Vi Tran

I solved it by adding the model to a simple chart (the simplest would be a bullet point), then hide every part of the chart, and prevent it from showing in view time. You can reduce load time of that chart by including only one dummy key figure in your query.

Hello everybody,
do you have any idea how i can empty the tax account balance sur SAP ?
For my part, I tried to do the operation by writing to the journal and I unchecked 'Automatic VAT calculation' but this error message was blocked for me "[DSC1], 'Cannot use non-recoverable tax group for this transaction' ".
Any ideas ?
You can simply deselect tax code from journal entry line, then it will become black again. Such posting without tax code will only be visible in your trial balance, it will not reflect tax reports.
Hello,
I'm new to the forums here and I tried reading through the rules for posting prior but couldn't find anything related to my request. Apologies if this isn't the proper place to be asking for this.
Recently, we have been looking at implementing project stock for various reasons. For example, to keep moving average price separate for regular stock since we likely won't get those bulk discounted rates, separates the stock logically from regular stock which would keep our reorder point automation system more in line for regular business (not impacted by large quantity purchases / consumptions for projects), etc.
We are looking for any input on pros and cons of project stock. Currently, we are focusing primarily on valuated project stock rather than non-valuated. Any insights, experiences, concerns, inputs, issues... would be greatly appreciated. We think we see the benefits of using project stock, but we want to make sure we aren't missing any of the pain points either.
I hope this is appropriate to ask in the forum, but we are really looking to have a conversation with another business who has implemented project stock if you are willing to connect with us. Ideally, we would like to speak with another utility business, but are open to discussing project stock in general. We just want to discuss your experience with it and perhaps we could build a knowledge sharing relationship.
Just let me know. Any regular inputs here on the forum are great too! However, if you'd be willing to connect, that would be amazing.
Thanks!

Of course, in excel the suffix of the files changed from xls to xlsx. The old file format with xls was denied through a policy. Now when I start KP26/KP06 I get the message SOFFICEINTEGRATION016. I think the KP06/KP26 tries to work with the old Excel Files xls. In the Table KPP1PHF I only see XLS files. My problem is how to migrate this old excel files in KP34 to XLSX files. 
Kind regards, Henning
Hello Henning Schindler
Hi Diyesh, 
sorry, this is my mistake. In KP06/KP26 alle the excel inplace files are xls files. xls files are not allowed by policies. So, I must migrate all the xls files into xlsx files. 
We got an answer form SAP: 

If you cannot allow workbooks and templates of Excel 97-2003 in Office, please simply repeat step 1 ("Extract attached file and save extracted excel template _MASTE1.XLT to your PC") in the solution part of SAP Note 1826481 - but save file in XLTM format (instead of XLT format). Then also repeat steps 2 - 5 in order to import the XLTM Excel template file. 
This solved our problem


In MD04 I get this

52: No BOM selected (S2)
Message no. MD408

What could be the problem?

This is a E 50 material. I checked the BOM structure and validity. No problem with those.
Did you check BOM category, release status, del flag?
Dear,

The possible reasons for " No BOM Selected " Exception Message 52 could be 

1. Validity period of BOM 
2. BOM Status (should be active for MRP.)
3. BOM Components should be relevant to production.
4. Check whether you have defined the selection ID for the priority of BOM Usage in SPRO define order of priority of 
BOM Usage.

Thanks,
MS
Hi,

Check if there is a component in BOM for which MRP material master data is not created for plant.

Regards.
Hi All,


Checked following before I posted this question and there are no problems with them:

BOM usage: 1
BOM status: 1
Valid from: September 2011
Lot Size for BOM and routing: 1
No deletion flags are turned on for BOM, material and components
BOM item Production relevant: yes
BOM materials are of same plant
Rerun MRP: yes... does not help. quantity of VSEB and plan orders can change but the message 52 still remains and does not explode.


This is only happening in my QAS system... production system with same material and information is ok.
no production version
I dont think its due to config... only happening to this material and in QAS.
VSEB and plan order are generated for 2012.
The problem could be you have more than one bom to choose from, the system does not know which one to choose so it doesnt select any and issues this message.

Hi All,
We are using SAP Analytics Cloud and there is a requirement of two measures to be shown as overlap ... (Like actual vs plan)
I haven't found any trick till now.
Is there any way to reduce the width of SAC bar?

Regards,
Kiran
Hi Kiran,It's simple to build overlapped bars. In the color section use option "Show as" -> "Layered Bars":

Also if you want to define width of bars you can try to use "Chart Scaling" option:

Hope it helps you.
Regards, Anton
Hi Anton,
Many thanks for your help. It works like a charm.
But I am facing a problem where I need to plot 4 KPIs. basically 2 KPI groups
Plan KPI 1, Actual KPI 1, Plant KPI 2, Actual KPI 2
When I plot all four using layering they come in one line and are not distinguishable.
The other option is KPI 1 + KPI 2 to be stacked but Plan & Actual as separate bars. But that option is not available with stacked chart.
Any workaround you suggest?
Regards,
Kiran

Hi experts
We are facing an issue that error appeared when executing the PMG:RKERV002 to repost the COPA document from SD Billing.
Please help investigating this issue and teach us how to fix it.
Initially, we set G/L Account Type for one revenue account wrongly.
It should have been set as Primary Costs or Revenue but was set as Non operating Expense or Income.
Therefore, while we did the billing, Accounting document was generated and COPA document was generated but without the revenue.
We were following the below steps to recover the COPA documents.
1, Reversed the COPA document based on the Reference document number[the billing document number] by PGM:RKECADL1
2, Fixed the setting of G/L account type for revenue account (Before: Non-operating Expense or Income; After: Primary Costs or Revenue)
3, repost the COPA document based on the Reference document number [the billing document number] by PGM:RKERV002
We have tested this recovery successfully in test environment, the first and second step also was executed successfully in Production environment.
but below error appeared for partial COPA document when executing the PGM:RKERV002.
Message no. KF755
Message:Document "" is not profit-related and thus could not be transferred.

Hello Experts!

We're working on replication of custom fields from IS-U to CRM 7.0.

Can you help me with clarification of my understanding of these questions..?

1) CRM/IS-U mapping tables for buag_main:
Business Agreement(BUAG_MAIN) is a BO in CRM that corresponds to CRM table CRMM_BUAG and to Contract account in IS-U table FKKVKP. 
Table FKKVKP were enhanced with some z-fields,
so we are going to enhance corresponding CRM table CRMM_BUAG (or CRMM_BUAG_H) with that new fields..But we see that these CRM and IS-U tables have far not the same field structures..

So, the question: Which crm and is-u tables i should look, enhance and replicate for Business agreement?

2) Access to Business agreement with possibility to add custom field:
I couldn't find in Web UI where i can directly edit profile of Business Agreement..I've found just access to assignment block "Business agreement" on Account's profile overview page..(Role ServicePRO; Account details).
There I used AET to add custom field..but I faced with problem when the 1st popup appeared: there was no enhanced object "Business Agreement"..
Also in role "Utilities IC Agent" i've found "business agreement" profile but there I don't see buttons for adding custom fields..

So, the question is: Where I can access Business agreement profile to enhance it with custom fields for replication with IS-U?

3) CRM/IS-U data exchange functions:I tend to use tcode CRMC_BUT_CALL_FU: for CRM inbound event of BUAG object - FM CRM_BUAG_MWX_PROCESS_EXT_STRUC..(as template).
Question: Am I right that it fits my requirement to replicate custom fields from IS-U to CRM?


Please tell me if you need more information..


Looking forward to your answers.

Thank you a lot in advance!



Kind regards,Evgenia

We have the following situation
Salesorder in Spain, delivery from Belgium to Poland. 
as the Goods will not arrive in Spain, 'the transaction happens out of Spain, so it is not under the scope of Spanish Vat' so the customer invoice must be created with a special vat code '0% no sujeta' 
when the delivery is from Spain to Poland, also 0% is calculated, but this is with normal vat code. 
how can this be solved in SAP, it is not possible to enter this in VK12.

Since maintenance for BW 7.5 will end on 2027 (extended to 2030), what will happen with S/4HANA Embedded BW beyond that date?
Hello https://people.sap.com/johandalmau,
The maintenance for SAP BW 7.5 will continue to the end of 2027 with extended maintenance to 2030.
SAP BW/4HANA will be aligned with the SAP S/4HANA maintenance extension and be maintained until at least 2040.
For more details refer below SAP thread.

Regards,
Neeraj Jain 
Hi Johan, I think nothing will change after 2027 (2030) except support of embedded BW within S/4. Custumers will be able to use it just it won't be supported in case no extended support is procured by the customer from SAP.
However, I'd suggest checking this topic with your account manager from SAP.

My input have multiple product field. And output have multiple product component field.
Here the requirement is I need to send 2nd occurrence of the product from input to product component.
Kindly provide your suggestion.

Hi Sabana,
This can be achieved with index function on field level with graphical mapping. If you don't have any other condition you can just implement if without else and check if index equals 2. Index function is in Statistics of graphical mapping. There is old PI related thread about similar requirement. Let me know if it helps.

Dear Experts,
is there a functionality to keep a memo value that is not depreciated for assets in S4 HANA Public Cloud? It is used for assets that are past their useful life, but are not yet deactivated (usually an amount of 1€ is kept as a memo value). That function is available for on-premise systems, but I can't find anything in Customizing for Public Cloud.
Thank you!
Best regards,
Niklas
Hi Niklas
Check out the scrap value settings in the Depreciation Area, you can set the value there. Once you save 1 for Company Code Currency, you can edit again and enter 1 for group currency. For some depreciation areas, because of the rounding involved, if the amount is too low, it will be rounded down to zero.

Dear SAP Community,
We created a query on BW on Hana and set some key figures as hide(can be shown).

We have a list and navigation panel to report this on lumira. There is no additional script in lumira to restrict the key frigures' visibility.
Crosstab component:

Navigation panel: Where we filter Key figures

Where we define conditions to inlcude or exculude.

As it is not meaningful to do it with UIDs . I' d like to ask you opinion if it is a bug or is there a way to fix it?
Hello ,
Initially I used Odata V2 for my app but later changed it to Odata V4 and see the below behavior changes. Please let me know how I can fix these.
- My list report now have the check boxes against each line where user can select multiple lines at the same time. How can i allow user to select only one record at a time (Radio buttons)? Odata V2 allows only single record selection.
- When I select 'Create' option from the list report, there is a popup coming asking to enter key field which I would like to avoid because I am generating this key using early numbering. I can ignore the popup by selecting 'continue' on it but would like to know if there is any way I can avoid getting the popup. Using Odata V2 does not give any popup.
Appreciate your response.
Hi Balu,
1. Change "multiselect" to false in the manifest file for the list report page then it will appear as single select.
2. The pop up comes as a feature in Odata V4, make the key field as read only then I think pop up could be suppressed. 
Thanks,
Pavan
Hi Pavan,
Thank you, but the multiselect option is not available in manifest.json file to set it to false when I use Odata V4.
Its only available when I use Odata V2.
Hi Experts,

I am displaying an AVL report using OOPS.
It is an Interactive report where user can select an line item and call some other screen, and from there call the report screen.

I have written CALL SELECTION-SCREEN 1000 to call the selection screen(Screen no 1000) from the Report.
The selection screen gets called. But when I execute again (within the same session) the START-OF-SELECTION does not get execute, hence no data gets populated in internal tables.
I am not sure whether this is because of CALL SELECTION-SCREEN?

Please help.

Thanks in Advance.
Rohan.
HI Rohan,

Maybe you can use " CALL TRANSACTION SY-TCODE " to call the program again 
instead of using call selection-screen '1000'. 

I wish it could help you.

HI Rohan use 
CALL SELECTION-SCREEN 1000 USING SELECTION-SET vari . 
This will triger the selection screen events .

Regards,
Rajesh
Hi Rajesh,

Thanks for your reply.

But still, Start-of-selection is not getting executed when I execute again after CALL SELECTION-SCREEN 1000.
Do I need to set variant as per your reply?


Thanks.
Hi Rohan,

The default selection screen has number 1000.

For calling it in to your program use

.
The CALL SELECTION-SCREEN 1000 does not trigger the START-OF-SELECTION event, but it will trigger the AT SELECTION-SCREEN events (PBO OUTPUT/PAI else), and then resume the next statement (with sy-subrc which indicates if user has executer/cancelled the selection).

You could try something like
But if fear that the screen stack may trigger a dump after some loops. Do nothing and at the end of the START-OF-SELECTION section, the program will display the first SELECTION-SCREEN.

Regards,
Raymond.
Hi,

You are using call selection-screen 1000. It is not going in start-of-selection.

In oops, You will use another way

Creating ALV Grid in Report without using screen 

Define an empty selection screen in your program dont use screen painter.

ex: 

step 1 : selection-screen begin of screen 1001.
 selection-screen end of screen 1001.

step 2 :For display, use as reference lvc_s_layo, cl_gui_alv_grid.

step 3: events at selection-screen output for use


at selection-screen output.

at start-of-selection.

step:4 call method w_alv->set_table_for_first_display ( fieldcatalopgue)

 step5 : call selection-screen 1001.

I hope, it will helps to you.

Hi Folks,
if I run a data action with some advanced formulas is there a way to log some errors/warnings?
Let's say I got a formula that calculates with a dimension property and I would like to see a warning in my notifications if this dimension property is empty.
Something like that possible?
Thanks and best regardsAxel
That's not possible in data action. I would recommend you to create a feature request in customer influence portal.
Axel Radack
Currently there is no such error logging capability in Data Action. Alternatively you can approach this in Application designer where the script can check for property value blank as issue an appropriate alert before the Data Action is triggered. There are API's to execute Data Action through the Analytical Application. Also with latest QRC release Stories and Analytical Apps are getting unified so this option can definitely be explored.
Hope this helps !!
Nikhil
Thanks for all replies. We will explore the Application designer idea from Nikhil. 
Meanwhile advocate to "simply" check the dimension properties before executing planning function option.
Hello all,
Do you know any table in SE16 that can show all the master data of an asset (i.e., asset description, WBS element, Cost Center, Cost Center description, country etc.). Thanks in advance for your support.
Kind Regards,
Hi George,
You've tagged the 'public cloud' forum which doesn't use SE16.
Are you referring to 'Assets' from the Plant Maintenance module (Functional Locations / Equipment)? 
or, are you referring to 'Assets' from Asset Accounting (FI-AA)?
Tim
It is not clear if you use S4Hana Public Cloud or an OnPrem Solution. 
For Public Cloud see the CDS views here in the help https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_CLOUD/3e5fcf2c768746049b5627bd5a42f720/3e4e64781f00498fb2bab41b90aa228c.html?locale=en-US
RegardsMark 
Hi George,

 
In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition you only can access the
system through Fiori apps, therefore you don’t have access to any transactions
(including SE16).
 
That said, you have access to the “Customer Data Browser”
App that has access to many tables and CDS views. You need to add the “SAP_BR_ADMINISTRATOR_DANA”
business role to the user before being able to access the app. Please refer to
the help for additional info about the Customer Data Browser Fiori App
 
Also please refer to the screenshot attached to see an
example of the Assets CDS view.

Hi All,

I am doing a development and I came across this limitations of the no. of items in a list box. Is it limited to a single digit..? Cause when i use call function 'VRM_SET_VALUES', the value returned in the field is the KEY, which is only 1 digit in my case. I have over 100 entries to be displayed in the list box. Can anyone tell me how to increase the no. of digits which get returned by the FM 'VRM_SET_VALUES'?

Please let me know.
Awaiting your reply.


Regards,

Pankaj.
Show us the code that you use to build the VRM table please.

I'm simply not understanding your problem. VRM table has 2 fields, key and text. Text is what is displayed and key is what is 
returned from the user selecting one item on the list. Only one value is returned. There is not multiple selection options.
This is code I use to generate a custome dropdown list.

Hi all,
We have added some font types to our BI 4.3 SP2. Installed fonts in RedHat server, and in user desktops (windows) and added to fontalias_v2. When we open a webi document we can choose new font and the text changes, but when we export to pdf the result is in Arial. This only happens with Fiori LaunchPad and pdf, exporting to excel works fine and also exporting to pdf from Rich Client works fine.
Does anyone know why this could be?
Thanks in advance
We found an error in webintelligence proccesing server's log that indicates where it is looking for the ttf files when exporting to pdf "**ERROR:repeng:REFontManager::FindPhysicalFont Font not Found". It's not exactly the path where fonts are installed in our server. Just copying the ttf files to some of those paths solves the problem. For example: sap_bobj/enterprise_xi40/linux_x64/fonts/ttf (the ttf folder does not exist originally) or sap_bobj/enterprise_xi40/linux_x64/monotype/fonts (here are the default fonts). 
Hi Folks,
I want to compare a specific month across 3 versions across 3 years.
Jan - 2022 - Actual VersionJan - 2023 - PLA VersionJan - 2024 - PLB Version
I created for that respectivly 3 restricted measures which work fine.
However, when I insert those measures in a table (to see just 3 columns) I am not able to remove the Version from the drill down although I set it in the filter to Actual, PLA, PLB.
As soon as I remove version it is prompting for a single version filter and replacing the multi version filter with the single version filter.
Do I miss something? Can I have just those three measures displayed without any version in drill down?
As soon as the version is in drill down "empty cells" will appear e.g. Jan - 2023 - PLA Version is obviously emtpy in Actual Version 
Thanks for any enlightment on this topic in advance.
Best regardsAxel
Axel Radack
In the restricted measure enable the constant selection option for the version and then remove the version from Column in the designer.


Hope this helps !!

I want use the query like 
SELECT person, ,employment_information, paycompensation_recurring, job_information WHERE EFFECTIVE_END_DATE >= to_datetime(today(),'yyyy-MM-dd')
This today() function is not working in SFSF Query language.
What is the actual format of succeeding this query?
Thanks in advance.

Hi Antony,
You can construct the query part using groovy script. You can try similar to the below once.
    DateFormat dateFormat= new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd");
	Date date = new Date();
 effective_end_date >= to_date('" +  dateFormat.format(date) + "')

I am not using CPI. I use PO 7.5 SFSF SOAP Sender.

Hi, 
we have 5 apps deployed and they show up correctly using cf html5-list
But the content explorer seems to have taken a dislike of one of the 5 app - it does not show up, no refresh helps. And yes it has the same manifest.json structure as all the other 4.
Is there a way to get the content explorer to report some log of why this is happening ? The button "log" which you can get is rather useless, it tells you basically nothing.

I’m trying to configure all the aspects need it around de OEE and KPI.
- Inside the Line Monitor Application, in Assets and OEE appears and error “Could not fetch OEE status data for 1 work center(s).” and does not recover any value. It seems that this errors comes from Work Center Configuration but in OEE Hierarchy part I’m not allow to select any OEE Hierarchy.
-In the OEE POD, Plant Insight, OEE insight applications does not recover any value. 
Are those error coming from because some configuration is missing? Or maybe I need to create an OEE hierarchy? How I could create an OEE Hierarchy? In any case, I created reasons codes and i assigned them. 
This maybe is the reason that in OEE Insight applications don’t appears any data. 
It would be grateful if someone could help me.

We have a requirement to encrypt data using AES algorithm and Encoding BASE64 using a AES key in ABAP. This key will be shared by a third party vendor. We have tried to use class CL_SEC_SXML_WRITER to do the same.
First we encrypt the the data(XSTRING), key(xstring) using Encrypt method. The output is in XSTRING format.
When the output is encoded in BASE64 format, the output is not correct.
Can someone guide if we are missing something?

Hi,
The structure is similar to PO.
<StatementName> <dbTableName action="UPDATE_INSERT"> <table>realDbTableName</table> <access> <col1>val1</col1> <col2>val2new</col2> </access> <key1> <col2>val2old</col2> <col4>val4</col4> </key1> <key2> <col2>val2old2</col2> </key2> </dbTableName> </StatementName>

Hi SD Gurus,
What are the different options/ways/possibilities available to deactivate certain condition types based on applicability of certain condition type/s in the pricing procedure. Basically, i see condition types with yellow traffic lights even though the condition record exists, and the requirement is met. How can this be possible?
Rgds,
SDUser.
see note 836243
I specified A LOT of things in Arial and it's generating them in Times New Roman.
Yes, these things happen...You can report it to SAP and insist on repairing it. And in the meantime, you will have to deal with it manually (or by macros in MS Office).
In reports, there is some space for improvement:)

This has been a problem for YEARS ; but I guess with an SAP product, we just have to endure it while SAP ignore the fact and keep on raking in $$$.
Hi,
I am trying to add grouping to the table on my List Report page. I added the following annotations in CDS:
annotate service with @(UI: {
    PresentationVariant : {
        SortOrder      : [{
            $Type    : 'Common.SortOrderType',
            Property : occurredAt,
            Descending : true
        }],
        GroupBy : [
            correlationId
        ],      
        RequestAtLeast : [
            occurredAt, correlationId
        ],
        Visualizations : ['@UI.LineItem']
    },
...
Sorting for the table seems to work as intended, however group by has no effect. I also tried different table types (GridTable, TreeTable, AnalyticalTable) but the grouping does not get applied for any type.
What is the correct way to group data in a table of the List Report page via annotations?
While posting T.code = VA01 - sales order
I got this error....


Pricing error: Mandatory condition TTX1 is missing
Message no. V1801
Diagnosis
The obligatory condition TTX1 does not exist. The document is therefore considered to be incomplete from the point of view of pricing. The cause can be, for example, that a condition record does not exist for condition TTX1 or that a field overflow has occurred when the condition amount was calculated.
Procedure
Check why the condition could not be found. Use the pricing analysis function on the pricing screen to do this. If necessary, add the missing condition manually to the document.


in VA01 analysis mode showing this error.......how can i clear this

i have maintained in t.code = BP - customer master

and in T.code = MM01 - material master

In T.code = VK11

In plant T.code = OX10

you may check the customer master > sales area data under billing tab,  taxes,  this condition is maintained with required classification
Hi, I'm trying to follow the concat in Odata, based on this one:
capire - Serving OData APIs (cloud.sap)
When I use this query:
/ApproverService/RequestTasks  ?$apply=filter(status eq 'DONE')/concat(aggregate($count as totalCount),
  groupby((action),aggregate($count as countPerStatus)))
Which is based on the query in the document:
GET /Books  ?$apply=filter(author/name eq 'Bram Stroker')/concat(aggregate($count as totalCount),  groupby((year),aggregate($count as countPerYear)))
I have this error:
<error xmlns="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/ns/metadata">  <code>501</code>  <message>Feature is not supported: Transformation "3" with query option $apply</message></error>
But this one is okay:
/ApproverService/RequestTasks  ?$apply=filter(status eq 'DONE')/groupby((action),aggregate($count as countPerStatus))
Not sure this is a limit of SAP CAP NodeJS or not (My version is 5.6.2), but we should update the document, so the user know this is a limit of the framework, or we should fix it.
Hi Andrew, The concat feature is only supported in Java. See the corresponding table in the documentation: https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/advanced/odata#transformations.
Good afternoon!
This is the situation:
 I have "Testuser1","Testuser2", and "Testuser3". I need to configure their authorities in the system so that "Testuser1" sees only his purchase orders, "Testuser2" sees only his own, and "Testuser3" has the authority to view his purchase orders, as well as "Testuser1" and 2. 
Is it possible to do this somehow at the level of authority, or in some other way?
even if the first and second are engaged in the same procurement group, they shouldn't see what they did not create
Hi, 
You can control this by creating 3 Authorization roles with the help of Basis team.
here are the authorization objects.
M_BEST_WRK	Plant in purchase order
M_BEST_BSA	Document Type in purchase order
M_BEST_EKG	Purchasing Group in purchase order
M_BEST_EKO	Purchasing Organization in purchase order
I am using Excel Inplace on some of my SAP tables and after I click on it excel will open, blank document, and give me a secuirty notice stating: "Microsoft has blocked macros from running because the source of the file is untrusted". With one option of Disable Macros, which if I click I just get a blank excel document opened.
I have gone into Excel's Developer Tab>Code>Macro Secuirty>Macro Settings and Trusted access to VBA project object model and tried enabling other secuirty options too but I will always get the file is untrusted error. What could be causing this error when I run Excel Inplace
Dear Experts,
we have changed the standard determination of the customer VAT Number and Tax category using the settings in SSCUI 103110 from the standard logic to 'B', i.e. always from Payer.
However, the derivation of destination country is still according to the standard logic, i.e. from the ship-to party. Is there a way to change this standard logic as well?
The KBA Note 21734 describes a way via a modification and user exits. Basically, we would like to implement the Option 3 described in the Note: Under option 3, the destination country is determined according to the same logic as the determination of the customer's tax number (STCEG) and tax classification (TAXK1).
Is there a way to achieve the same in public Cloud?
Thank in advance for your hints.
Andrea
Dear Andrea,
You may want to explore the Business Add-Ins (BAdIs) for Sales Documents. 
Via the 'Tax Field Modifications for Sales Document Headers' (SD_SLS_MODIFY_HEAD_TAX) you can set or change values for tax-relevant fields in the sales document header.
Best regards,Katalin
Dear Katalin,
thank you for your answer. I have explored the BadI SD_SLS_MODIFY_HEAD_TAX in our test system. However, I only see the following fields as modifiable via salesdocument_tax_out:
Country/Region of Sales Tax ID Number, Tax Departure Country/Region, Tax Classification 1 for Customer, Indicator: Triangular Deal Within the EU
 
We would like to modify the field: Dest. Country/Region
I would highly appreciate any idea on how this could be achieved.
Best regards,
Andrea


Hello Experts,
Is there a way in SAP CC Core Tool or in SOM to re-activate expired contracts? We have provider contracts that already reached the end date and we want to know if there's a way to extend the contract end date even after it has already reached the contract end date.
Best Regards,
Karl
Hi Karl,
Do you mean that you've set (and reached) the end date of all the contract's items?If so, you can indeed modify these end dates:- In Core tool, you can simply remove (or push back) the date, in the "End date" field. This will change (or erase) the end date for the contract's latest revision of the affected item. If  several items are involved, you'll need to repeat the operation manually for each of them.- Using the SOAP API (SOM relies upon that), you can call the "chargingContractMaintain" method of the provisioning web service. This operates a bit differently from Core tool: each "chargingContractMaintain" query completely overwrites the existing contract, and must consequently contain all the revisions of all the items you want to keep. This means that, in the SOAP envelope, you have to repeat the unchanged item revisions, and also provide the latest revision of the each item you want to extend, but with the proper end date (or with no date at all).
It seems that you're asking the question because you've observed that CC wouldn't let you change a date in the past.You indeed aren't allowed to set an end date before the operation's date (i.e., the current date, while using Core tool), but any date after the operation's date is fine.
This is what the CC updater can handle, but only SOM experts will be able to tell you whether/how you can generate the required SOAP queries. You might consequently want to add the SOM tag to your question, to draw their attention.Feel free to ask for more details if needed.
Best regards.

Hi Experts,
I am setting up a few integrations to create shipments on the FedEx site. According to the FedEx site they support OAuth 2.0. However every attempt I have made to connect has ended in error. The error I am getting is: 
HTTP OAUTH 2.0 CLIENT CREDENTIALS GRANT call to https://apis-sandbox.fedex.com:443/oauth/token not successful. Error while processing Authorization request:iaik.security.ssl.SSLException: Peer sent alert: Alert Fatal: internal error.
Is there anyone who has successfully connected their SAP PI 7.5 to FedEx using the REST Adapter? If so could you give me some advice as to how you did it?
All help is appreciated.
David Pauley
Good morning,
I would expect this to be rather an SSL issue than an OAuth issue. Check the URL using xpi_insector (SAP Note 2010715 - How to deploy/undeploy the XPI INSPECTOR) and use check no. 11 (SAP Note 2673775 - How to collect IAIK debug trace for outgoing calls in AS Java). Perhaps you need to import the CA authority of the certificate into your key store.
Check the website using ssllabs.com. According to my check they support the following cipher suites for TLS 1.2:
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xc030) ECDH secp256r1 (eq. 3072 bits RSA) FS256TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xc02f) ECDH secp256r1 (eq. 3072 bits RSA) FS128TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 (0xcca8) ECDH secp256r1 (eq. 3072 bits RSA) FS256PTLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 (0xc028) ECDH secp256r1 (eq. 3072 bits RSA) FS WEAK256TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 (0xc027) ECDH secp256r1 (eq. 3072 bits RSA) FS WEAK128TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0xc014) ECDH secp256r1 (eq. 3072 bits RSA) FS WEAK256TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (0xc013) ECDH secp256r1 (eq. 3072 bits RSA) FS WEAK128
check these values against the supported ciphers of your installation in /usr/sap/<SID>/SYS/global/SSLContext.properties (SAP Note 2616983 - How to customize cipher suites in SSLContext.properties file)

Dear All,
From around three weeks, I have been exploring Kyma runtime with no prior knowledge on any part of the technology. As of today, I have my local machine with required tools installed and am also able to use the Kyma Config to apply the application shared on GitHub:
kyma-runtime-extension-samples/address-completion-c4c/sales-cloud-address-completion-here at main · SAP-samples/kyma-runtime-extension-samples (github.com)
I understand config has been changed since this was posted like SKR no longer has Catalog to be setup, rather I just added my C4C in system landscape and use the Central Gateway URL (hope my understanding is right?) I completed below steps:

Setting up system under BTP system landscape along with Formation
Setup the Event notification on C4C using token from the registered system on BTP
Deploy the application from GitHub to my trial account Kyma runtime. Applied function.yaml, subscription.yaml and created the secret for the application.as mentioned in the Github post.

I don't see any error as such on these deployments on Kyma runtime. Do you think I am missing any step? I tried testing from C4C but nothing changed on the wrong address maintained. I see status 200 (successful) on the event notification monitor.

Hi Experts,
I need to connect SAP BO 4.3 with SAP DWC . I check as there is no direct way to connect and also check if any connection can be created through IDT . I saw in Relational connection under SAP , DWC connection is there .
let me know the connection parameters and correct way to connect with same.
TIA.
regards,
Avinash 
Hi Avinash, 
After installing SAP HANA client, We made a new ODBC connection


After that, you can create a new relational connection in your SAP BO Information design tool, using this ODBC connection.

Finally, you will be able to create new universes using this connection.

Hi,
Is there a way to have a where used functionality for ABAP CDS views, eg in which other CDS views, ABAP programs, classes, ... is a certain ABAP CDS view reused?
This in order to find out what the impact will be if a certain change is done in a ABAP CDS.
Cheers
Eddy

Hi Eddy,
In t-code SDDLAR (CDS Analysis and Repair Tools) in backend ABAP system, you can find other ABAP CDS views consuming the current view based on name.
Choose option 'Display DDL Source' and click on 'Analyze' button.In the 'Regular Expression (partial match)' section, provide the name of ABAP CDS for which you want to do where used and check the 'Ignore Case' flag.Click Execute.
It will scan through the other ABAP CDS views to find the name of the searched view in their code.Since this is a code scan of the ABAP CDS, it might also return some additional results based on usage of name as regular expression.
-Nabhish
Hello,
I found out that it worked for me, if i right-click on the CDS view in the outline view and select "Get Where-used List".
Regards,
Philipp
Right click on the view name ( the one after the define view statement) and choose get where used list...
 Thomas Fiedler Is there anything planned for the future? I'm still missing that feature (where-used list for DDL Sources/CDS Views) in the latest S/4HANA Release and the latest ADT Version.
Best regards, Thomas
Although CDS views themselves are very powerful feature then lack of 'where-used' functionality in Eclipse makes my life more difficult :-(. Hopefully it will be implemented in the new upcoming versions. Best regards Bogdan
Hi,
I've already tried that, but I'm getting the message "Where-used is not supported at this position. Select a supported object and perform the search again".
Cheers
Eddy
Eddy, you need to right-click on a CDS View definition in the code editor, not the DDL source file in Project Explorer! I still bounce into the same thing after 3 years myself ;)
Cheers,
Dmitry Kuznetsov
BI Consulting
Where used list is working when right click the CDS entity name in definition. But it doesn't show the roles / access controls for that CDS view. How can i find the role / access control for any CDS view?
Table DDDDLSRC holds all the source code of your CDS views. We commonly use TVARVC variables and before we make changes to these variables (because multiple programs and/or CDS views may use the same variables) we scan our ABAP and our CDS views.
please verify this blog . https://blogs.sap.com/2020/04/28/abap-cds-view-object-flow-program/
